AB We explore how X-ray computed microtomography can be used to generate highly-resolved 3D biofilm datasets on length scales that span multiple pore bodies. The data is integrated into a study of the effects of flow rate on three-dimensional growth of biofilm in porous media. Three flow rates were investigated in model packed-bed columns. Biofilm growth was monitored during an 11-day growth period using a combination of differential pressure and effluent dissolved oxygen measurements. At the end of the growth period, all columns were scanned using X-ray computed microtomography and a barium sulfate-based contrast agent. The resulting images were prepared for quantitative analysis using a novel image processing workflow that was tailored to this specific system. The reduction in permeability due to biofilm growth was studied using both transducer-based pressure drop measurements and image-based calculations using the Kozeny-Carman model. In addition, a set of structural measures related to the spatial distribution of biofilms were computed and analyzed for the different flow rates. We generally observed 1 to 2 orders of magnitude decrease in permeability as a result of bioclogging for all columns (i.e, across flow rates). The greatest average permeability and porosity reduction was observed for the intermediate flow rate (4.5 ml/h). A combination of results from different measurements all suggest that biofilm growth was oxygen limited at the lowest flow rate, and affected by shear stresses at the highest flow rate. We hypothesize that the interplay between these two factors drives the spatial distribution and quantity of biofilm growth in the class of porous media studied here. Our approach opens the way to more systematic studies of the structure-function relationships involved in biofilm growth in porous media and the impact that such growth may have on physical properties such as hydraulic conductivity.

AB Among the large rivers rising on the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent high mountains, the discharge and suspended sediment load of the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River are the least well known. Data collected between 1969 and 1996 at Pyay (Pronle) are analysed to provide the best available modern estimate of discharge (379 +/- 47 x 10(9) m(3)/year) and suspended sediment load (325 +/- 57 x 10(6) t/year) for the river upstream of the delta head. A statistical comparison with data collected in the nineteenth century (1871 to 1879) shows discharge has significantly decreased in the last similar to 100 years. Regression and correlation analyses between discharge in the modern period and indices of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) show a relationship. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper presents a novel coupled flow-vegetation interaction model capable to resolve the flow and motion of flexible vegetation with large deflections simultaneously on a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian grid. The hydrodynamics model is based on a Navier-Stokes flow solver with the Volume of Fluid surface capturing method in OpenFOAM. The deforming and moving vegetation are tracked through a series of Lagrangian grids attached to the vegetation and embedded in the computational domain of OpenFOAM. The governing equations for the flexible vegetation motion are based on a slender rod theory and are solved by a Finite Element Method on a vegetation-following Lagrangian grid. The hydrodynamics and vegetation models are coupled through the vegetation-induced hydrodynamic forces using a novel diffused immersed boundary method to avoid excessive fluid grid refinements around the vegetation. The standard two-equation k-epsilon turbulence model is extended for vegetated flow by incorporating additional closure terms of vegetation effects. The newly developed coupled flow-vegetation model is validated against experiments for both individual single-stem vegetation and a vegetation patch in a large-scale wave flume. Model results of asymmetric displacement of the vegetation motion, wave height decay, and wave kinematics within and outside the vegetation patch are in good agreement with measurements. The drastical change in wave radiation stress by the presence of vegetation patch leads to a strong current jet near the top of vegetation patch, which in turn drives a local circulation pattern around the vegetation patch. The effect of vegetation bending stiffness on the model results and empirical drag and inertia coefficients for calculating the hydrodynamic forces are examined in detail. Maximum turbulence energy is observed close to the bed and the top of vegetation patch just before and after the wave crest/trough, where the relative flow velocity to vegetation is large.

AB any recent studies have been devoted to the investigation of the nonlinear dynamics of rainfall or streamflow series based oil methods of dynamical systems theory. Although finding evidence for the existence of a low-dimensional deterministic component in rainfall or streamflow is of much interest, not much attention has been given to the nonlinear dependencies of the two and especially on how the spatio-temporal distribution of rainfall affects the nonlinear dynamics of streamflow at flood time scales. In this paper, a methodology is presented which simultaneously considers streamflow series, spatio-temporal structure of precipitation and catchment geomorphology into a nonlinear analysis of streamflow dynamics. The proposed framework is based on "hydrologically-relevent" rainfall-runoff phase-space reconstruction acknowledging the fact that rainfall-runoff is a stochastic spatially extended system rather than a deterministic multivariate one. The methodology is applied to two basins in Central North America using 6-hour streamflow data and radar images for a period of 5 years. The proposed methodology is used to: (a) quantify the nonlinear dependencies between streamflow dynamics and the spatio-temporal dynamics of precipitation; (b) study how streamflow predictability is affected by the trade-offs between the level of detail necessary to explain the spatial variability of rainfall and the reduction of complexity due to the smoothing effect of the basin; and (c) explore the possibility of incorporating process-specific information (in terms of catchment geomorphology and an a priori chosen uncertainty model) into nonlinear prediction. Preliminary results are encouraging and indicate the potential of using the proposed methodology to understand via nonlinear analysis of observations (i.e., not based on a particular rainfall-runoff model) streamflow predictability and limits to prediction as a function of the complexity of spatio-temporal forcing relative to basin geomorphology.

AB High-severity wildfires can increase hillslope-scale sediment yields by several orders of magnitude. Accurate predictions of postfire sediment yields are needed to guide management decisions and assess the potential impact of soil loss on site productivity and downstream aquatic resources. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Disturbed WEPP are the most commonly used models to predict postfire sediment yields at the hillslope scale, but neither model has been extensively tested against field data. The objectives of this paper are to ( 1) compare predicted sediment yields from RUSLE and Disturbed WEPP against 252 plot years of data from nine fires in the Colorado Front Range; and ( 2) suggest how each model might be improved. Predicted and measured sediment yields were poorly correlated for RUSLE (R-2 = 0.16) and only slightly better correlated for Disturbed WEPP (R-2 = 0.25). Both models tended to over-predict sediment yields when the measured values were less than 1 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and to under-predict higher sediment yields. Model accuracy was not improved by increasing the soil erodibility ( K) factor in RUSLE and was only slightly improved by slowing the vegetative recovery sequence in Disturbed WEPP. Both models much more accurately predicted the mean sediment yields for hillslopes grouped by fire and severity (R-2 = 0.54 to 0.66) than for individual plots. The performance of RUSLE could be improved by incorporating an erosivity threshold and a nonlinear relationship between rainfall erosivity and sediment yields. The performance of WEPP could be improved by reducing the effective hydraulic conductivity in sites that have recently burned at high severity. The results suggest that neither model can fully capture the complexity of the different controlling factors and the resultant plot-scale variability in sediment yields.

AB Based on the analogy between Darcy's law for groundwater flow and Ohm's law for electric current flow, a methodology has been developed to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity of hard rock granite aquifer from geoelectrical. parameters. The common parameter, aquifer thickness (t), has been used to combine the two relations and form an analytical equation. Mathematical. relation shows a negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and aquifer resistivity, and a positive correlation between transmissivity and longitudinal conductance. The methodology has been calibrated and validated in hard rock granite aquifers in India. The good agreement between aquifer hydraulic conductivity (K) and transmissivity (T) obtained from the resistivity sounding parameters and those obtained from pumping test analysis proves the potentiality of the methodology. It has been applied to estimate the K and T from the surface electrical resistivity parameters and results were utilized to prepare the K and T maps of Maheshwaram watershed in hard rock terrain in India.

AB Water repellency (WR) is a property that has implications on the hydrologic balance in affected soils. In semi-arid areas where water supply is limited, even slight WR may play an important role in the infiltration and spatial distribution of precipitation into the soil. Acidic and sandy-textured soils have been demonstrated to be more prone to develop WR, but there are studies reporting water repellent properties in other soil types. In the present study we investigated soil WR under four plant species in a semi-arid area with a calcareous, medium-textured forest soil. For this purpose, 160 soil samples were taken at micro-sites under different species (Pinus halepensis, Quercus coccifera, Juniperus oxycedrus and Rosmarmus officinalis). Soil WR was measured with the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test on air-dried samples. Samples with WDPT > 5 s were classified as water repellent. WR was present in 20% of the samples, and its persistence ranged mainly between 10 and 30 s. Under P. halepensis and Q. coccifera, WR occurred more frequently (40 and 30%, respectively) than under J. oxycedrus and R. officinalis (only 5% in both cases). In order to know the causes of the difference in occurrence of WR under the selected species and to establish relationships, soil organic matter (SOM) content and pH were measured for a selection of 66 samples, including all 32 water repellent and 34 wettable samples selected from those taken under the four species (n = 66). A negative relationship between WR and pH was found for all species. Moreover, in the case of P. halepensis soil samples, a positive correlation between WR and SOM content was found. A discriminant analysis allowed for the distinction between water repellent and wettable conditions in calcareous soils, based on the information provided by pH, SOM content and vegetation type. Soil pH turned out to be the most important parameter for discrimination. The hydrological and ecological implications from these results are discussed with special focus on the areas in the region extensively afforested with P. halepensis.

The aim of MWF is to estimate the coefficient of variation (C-V) and coefficient of skewness (C-S) from the original higher moment computations to the first-order moment calculations. The estimators for C-V and C-S of Pearson type three distribution function (PE3) were derived by weighting the moments of the distribution with two weight functions, which were constructed by combining two negative exponential-type functions. The selection of these weight functions was based on two considerations: (1) to relate weight functions to sample size in order to reflect the relationship between the quantity of sample information and the role of weight function and (2) to allocate more weights to data close to medium-tail positions in a sample series ranked in an ascending order. A Monte-Carlo experiment was conducted to simulate a large number of samples upon which statistical properties of MWF were investigated. For the PE3 parent distribution, results of MWF were compared to those of the original Weighted Function (WF) and Linear Moments (L-M). The results indicate that MWF was superior to WF and slightly better than L-M, in terms of statistical unbiasness and effectiveness. In addition, the robustness of MWF, WF, and L-M were compared by designing the Monte-Carlo experiment that samples are obtained from Log-Pearson type three distribution (LPE3), three parameter Log-Normal distribution (LN3), and Generalized Extreme Value distribution (GEV), respectively, but all used as samples from the PE3 distribution. The results show that in terms of statistical unbiasness, no one method possesses the absolutely overwhelming advantage among MWF, WF, and L-M, while in terms of statistical effectiveness, the MWF is superior to WF and L-M.

AB Stream incision is altering the hydroecology of riparian areas worldwide. In the Last Chance watershed in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, logging, overgrazing, and road/ railroad construction have caused stream incision, which resulted in drainage of riparian meadow sediments and a succession from native wet meadow vegetation to sagebrush and dryland grasses. Restoration efforts have been initiated to reestablish the ecosystem function of these systems. Original field data including stream stage records, water table hydrographs, sediment hydraulic properties, topographic transects, and aerial imagery of vegetation patterning were used to develop a model of an archetype meadow. Hydrologic behavior was simulated with a finite element model of variably saturated groundwater flow. This model was coupled to an empirical, time-dependent, vegetation threshold relationship between vegetation type and depth to the water table. This was a two-way coupling requiring an iterative approach because water table depth is a determinant of vegetation type, yet the vegetation regime influences water table depth through evapotranspiration. The hydrology and vegetation patterns were analyzed under pristine, degraded (incised), and restored conditions. For the case of deep streambed incision, our hydroecological model predicts the observed shift from mesic (wetter) to xeric (drier) vegetation communities and reproduces their imaged longitudinal zonation. This patterning is explained as a response to groundwater drainage to the stream, which creates dry zones with xeric vegetation adjacent to the stream, while preserving sufficient moisture at the margins of the meadow to support holdout populations of mesic vegetation. The model further predicts the reestablishment of meadow vegetation when the incised channel is filled and a new shallow channel is restored. The coupling of a near-surface hydrologic model to a vegetation response model may be used to design stream restoration projects by predicting vegetation patterning.

AB The standard exponential and logarithmic laws for flow velocity evaluation cannot be applied for gravel-bed streams due to the effect of large-scale roughness. An analytical model based on a two-layer subdivision approach was developed to predict flow velocity over a gravel array with different densities. The velocity distribution in the gravel layer was derived by solving the Darcy-Forchheimer-Brinkman (DFB) differential equation based on the concept of porous medium flows. The velocity in the surface layer was modeled by the mixing length theory with the length scale modified by taking into account the porous effect of the gravel (ball) arrays. To assess the model, flow velocities over gravel beds simulated by Ping-Pong ball arrays with different densities (or porosities) were measured in a laboratory flume. The results show that the predicted velocities by this subdivision model agree well with experimental data, reflecting that the porosity of the gravel array essentially impacts the flows both in the gravel layer and surface layer. In comparison with the existing models not considering the porous effect of the gravel bed, this model can effectively predict vertical velocity distributions and thereby flow resistances in gravel streams. The permeable interface velocity atop the gravel layer, as the boundary condition for the two-layer model, is sensitive to the bed context effect rather than the hydraulic effect, suggesting that the inflection point of the full velocity profile might be vital in determining the accuracy of the model. Moreover, with other data sources over dense gravel-bed, our model is suitable for data pre-dealt with the spatially averaging, where the spatial non-uniformity effect is great.

AB In recent years, water quality monitoring has been crucial to improve water resource protection and management. Under the relevant laws and regulations, environmental protection department agencies monitor lakes, streams, rivers, and other types of water bodies to assess water quality conditions. The valid and high-quality data generated from these monitoring activities help water resource managers understand the existing pollution situations, energy consumption problems and pollution control needs. However, there are inevitably many problems with water quality data in the real world due to human mistakes or system failures. One of the most frequently occurring issues is missing data. Although most existing studies have explored classic statistical methods or emerging machine/deep learning methods to fill gaps in data, these methods are not suitable for large-scale consecutive missing data problems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called TrAdaBoost-LSTM, which integrates state-of-the-art deep learning theory through long short-term memory (LSTM) and instance-based transfer learning through TrAdaBoost. This model inherits the full advantages of the LSTM model and transfer learning technique, namely the powerful ability to capture the long-term dependencies among time series and the flexibility of leveraging the related knowledge from complete datasets to fill in large-scale consecutive missing data. A case study involving Dissolved Oxygen concentrations obtained from water quality monitoring stations is conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed TrAdaBoost-LSTM model not only improves the imputation accuracy by 15%similar to 25% compared with that of alternative models based on the obtained performance indicators, but also provides potential ideas for similar future research.

AB The stagnant zones in nested flow systems have been assumed to be critical to accumulation of transported matter, such as metallic ions and hydrocarbons in drainage basins. However, little quantitative research has been devoted to prove this assumption. In this paper, the transport of age mass is used as an example to demonstrate that transported matter could accumulate around stagnation points. The spatial distribution of model age is analyzed in a series of drainage basins of different depths. We found that groundwater age has a local or regional maximum value around each stagnation point, which proves the accumulation of age mass. In basins where local, intermediate and regional flow systems are all well developed, the regional maximum groundwater age occurs at the regional stagnation point below the basin valley. This can be attributed to the long travel distances of regional flow systems as well as stagnancy of the water. However, when local flow systems dominate, the maximum groundwater age in the basin can be located around the local stagnation points due to stagnancy, which are far away from the basin valley. A case study is presented to illustrate groundwater flow and age in the Ordos Plateau, northwestern China. The accumulation of age mass around stagnation points is confirmed by tracer age determined by C-14 dating in two boreholes and simulated age near local stagnation points under different dispersivities. The results will help shed light on the relationship between groundwater flow and distributions of groundwater age, hydrochemistry, mineral resources, and hydrocarbons in drainage basins.

ID RAINFALL; MORPHOMETRY
AB Flooding from Hurricane Fran is examined as a prototype for central Appalachian flood events that dominate the upper tail of flood peak distributions at basin scales between 100 and 10,000 km(2). Hurricane Fran, which resulted in 34 deaths and more than $3.2 billion in damages, made land fall on the North Carolina coast at 0000 UTC, September 6, 1996. By 1200 UTC on September 6, Fran had weakened to a tropical storm, and the center of circulation was located at the North Carolina-Virginia border. Rain bands surrounding the tropical depression produced extreme rainfall and flooding in Virginia and West Virginia, with the most intense rainfall concentrated near ridge tops in the Blue Ridge and Valley and Ridge physiographic provinces. The most severe flooding occurred in the Shenandoah River watershed of Virginia, where peak discharges exceeded the 100-year magnitude at 11 of 19 U.S. Geological Survey stream-gaging stations. The availability of high-resolution discharge and rainfall data sets provides the opportunity to study the hydrologic and hydrometeorological mechanisms associated with extreme floods produced by tropical storms. Analyses indicate that orographic enhancement of tropical storm precipitation plays a central role in the hydrology of extreme floods in the central Appalachian region. The relationships between drainage network structure and storm motion also play a major role in Appalachian flood hydrology. Runoff processes for Hurricane Fran reflected a mixture of saturation excess and infiltration excess mechanisms. Antecedent soil moisture played a significant role in the hydrology of extreme flooding from Hurricane Fran. Land use, in particular, the presence of forest cover, was of secondary importance to the terrain-based distribution of precipitation in determining extreme flood response.

AB The immiscible fluid displacement pattern, controlled by the balance of viscous and capillary forces has a significant effect on the recovery or storage efficiency in subsurface processes. The phase diagram of displacement patterns has been extensively studied for the two-dimensional (2D) micromodel; however, that of the three-dimensional (3D) porous media has received little attention. This work experimentally studied the immiscible drainage displacement in an unconsolidated packed bed at the pore scale with a wide range of capillary number Ca and viscosity ratio M using X-ray micro-tomography. Three typical displacement patterns, namely viscous fingering, capillary fingering, and stable displacement, were observed in 3D porous media. The rough location of three displacement patterns on the Ca-M diagram was consistent with previous studies in 2D micromodel. The boundaries for three regimes were determined based on the quantitative analyses of the saturation distribution as functions of Ca and M. Compared with the result in 2D micromodel, a broader transition zone between different regimes was found in 3D porous media. The characterizations of finger structures (e.g. fractal dimension and finger width) were applied to reveal the mechanism of how the injected fluid invades the pores and throats inside porous media for different displacement patterns. The average fractal dimension of capillary fingerings was 2.58 +/- 0.05, which agrees with the 2.55 defined by the invasion percolation theory. For the viscous fingering, where the viscous force dominates the invasion process, the invading fluid follows a several preferential flow paths in the same direction as the injection and the finger width was only 1 to 2 pore bodies. Besides, the invasion dynamics under continuous injection conditions were compared for typical viscous and capillary fingerings. This study may improve our understanding of the dynamics of displacement processes jointly governed by the viscous/capillary forces in 3D porous media. Furthermore, the phase diagram under various conditions (i.e. a wide range of Ca and M) can help to find a suitable reservoir conditions for subsurface processes.

TI Catchment coevolution: A useful framework for improving predictions of

AB The notion that landscape features have coevolved over time is well known in the Earth sciences. Hydrologists have recently called for a more rigorous connection between emerging spatial patterns of landscape features and the hydrological response of catchments, and have termed this concept catchment coevolution. In this paper we review recent literature on this subject and attempt to synthesize what we have learned into a general framework that would improve predictions of hydrologic change. We first present empirical evidence of the interaction and feedback of landscape evolution and changes in hydrological response. From this review it is clear that the independent drivers of catchment coevolution are climate, geology, and tectonics. We identify common currency that allows comparing the levels of activity of these independent drivers, such that, at least conceptually, we can quantify the rate of evolution or aging. Knowing the hydrologic age of a catchment by itself is not very meaningful without linking age to hydrologic response. Two avenues of investigation have been used to understand the relationship between (differences in) age and hydrological response: (i) one that is based on relating present landscape features to runoff processes that are hypothesized to be responsible for the current fingerprints in the landscape; and (ii) one that takes advantage of an experimental design known as space-for-time substitution. Both methods have yielded significant insights in the hydrologic response of landscapes with different histories. If we want to make accurate predictions of hydrologic change, we will also need to be able to predict how the catchment will further coevolve in association with changes in the activity levels of the drivers (e.g., climate). There is ample evidence in the literature that suggests that whole-system prediction of catchment coevolution is, at least in principle, plausible. With this imperative we outline a research agenda that implements the concepts of catchment coevolution for building a holistic framework toward improving predictions of hydrologic change.

AB Snow accumulation and melt patterns play a significant role in the water, energy, carbon, and nutrient cycles in the montane environments of the Western United States. Recent studies have illustrated that changes in the snow/rainfall apportionments and snow accumulation and melt patterns may occur as a consequence of changes in climate in the region. In order to understand how these changes may affect the snow regimes of the region, the current characteristics of the snow accumulation and melt patterns must be identified. Here we characterize the snow water equivalent (SWE) curve formed by the daily SWE values at 766 snow pillow stations in the Western United States, focusing on several metrics of the yearly SWE curves and the relationships between the different metrics. The metrics are the initial snow accumulation and snow disappearance dates, the peak snow accumulation and date of peak, the length of the snow accumulation season, the length of the snowmelt season, and the snow accumulation and snowmelt slopes. Three snow regimes emerge from these results: a maritime, an intermountain, and a continental regime. The maritime regime is characterized by higher maximum snow accumulations reaching 300 cm and shorter accumulation periods of less than 220 days. Conversely, the continental regime is characterized by lower maximum accumulations below 200 cm and longer accumulation periods reaching over 260 days. The intermountain regime lies in between. The regions that show the characteristics of the maritime regime include the Cascade Mountains, the Klamath Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The intermountain regime includes the Eastern Cascades slopes and foothills, the Blue Mountains, Northern and Central basins and ranges, the Columbia Mountains/Northern Rockies, the Idaho Batholith, and the Canadian Rockies. Lastly, the continental regime includes the Middle and Southern Rockies, and the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains. The implications of snow regime classification are discussed in the context of possible changes in accumulation and melt patterns associated with regional warming.

AB Rainfall kinetic energy is a key factor in soil erosion processes. It is determined by rainfall intensity, related drop size distribution (DSD), and the drops' terminal velocity. Temporal variability in rainfall intensity is reflected in the DSD and affects the rainfall kinetic energy during the event. Smith et al. (2009) reported on 1-min interval rainfall intensity and corresponding DSD variability during a storm on 22 July 2006 at Princeton, New Jersey. They reported also on DSD characteristics of heavy convective rainfall events during the whole summer. It is shown that (1) a similar relationship between the mean drop size and the rainfall intensity characterized the local rainfall at both the seasonal and the single-storm scale, and (2) using the mean drop size as a scaling factor of the DSD removes the rainfall intensity dependence also at the intrastorm scale, providing a powerful tool to deal with temporal variability of rainfall rates during rainfall events. For a given storm characterized by a specific temporal variability of rates, three different ways of evaluating kinetic energy per unit mass or time were applied. By comparison to estimates accounting for rainfall temporal variability and related full DSDs, representing the storm by mean intensity and drop diameter tends to overestimate kinetic energy for low intensities and underestimate it for the higher ones. The relative error for the kinetic energy per unit of mass is +/- 45% and shifts from negative to positive sign for I > 25 mm/h. For the kinetic energy per unit of time, the relative error ranges from -100% to +210% and changes sign from negative to positive for I > 45 mm/h. When temporal variation of intensity is accounted for but drops are characterized by their mean values instead of the full DSD, kinetic energy is underestimated by 20% on average. Consequently, accounting for temporal variability in rainfall intensity during a storm has a notable impact on the erosive power of the rainfall.

AB Lateral saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, K-s,K-l, is the soil property governing subsurface water transfer in hillslopes, and the key parameter in many numerical models simulating hydrological processes at the hillslope and catchment scales. Likewise, the hydrological connectivity of the lateral flow paths plays a significant role in determining the rate of the subsurface flow at various spatial scales. This study investigates the relationship between K-s,K-l and hydrological connectivity at the hillslope spatial scale. K-s,K-l was determined by the subsurface flow rates intercepted by drains and water table depths observed in a well network. The hydrological connectivity was evaluated by the synchronicity among water table peaks, and between these and the peaks of the drained flow. Rainfall and soil moisture were used to investigate the influence of the transient hydrological soil condition on connectivity and K-s,K-l. As the synchronicity of the water table response between wells increased, the lag times between the peaks of water levels and those of the drained subsurface flow decreased. Moreover, the most synchronic water table rises determined the highest drainage rates. The relationships between K-s,K-l and water table depths were highly non-linear, with a sharp increase in the values for water table levels close to the soil surface. Estimated K-s,K-l values for the full saturated soil were in the order of thousands of mm h(-1), suggesting the activation of macropores in the root zone. The K-s,K-l values determined at the peak of the drainage events were correlated with the indicators of synchronicity. The sum of cumulative rainfall and antecedent soil moisture was correlated with the connectivity indicators and K-s,K-l. We suggest that, for simulating realistic processes at the hillslope scale, the hydrological connectivity could be implicitly considered in hydrological modelling through an evaluation of K-s,K-l at the same spatial scale.

AB The water retention curve (theta(Psi)), which defines the relationship between soil volumetric water content (theta) and matric potential (Psi), is of paramount importance in characterizing the hydraulic behaviour of soils. However, few methods are so far available for estimating theta(Psi) in undisturbed soil samples. We present a new design of TDR-pressure cell (TDR-Cell) for estimating theta(Psi) in undisturbed soil samples. The TDR-Cell consists of a 50-mm-long and 50-mm internal diameter stainless steel cylinder (which constitutes the outer frame of a coaxial line) attached to a porous ceramic disc and closed at the ends with two aluminium lids. A 49-mm-long and 3-mm-diameter stainless steel rod, which runs longitudinally through the centre of the cylinder, constitutes the inner rod of a coaxial TDR probe. The TDR-Cell was used to determine the theta(Psi) curves of a packed sand and seven undisturbed soil samples from three profiles of agricultural soils. These theta(Psi) curves were subsequently compared to those obtained from the corresponding 2-mm sieved soils using the pressure plate method. Measurements of bulk electrical conductivity, sigma(a), as a function of the water content, sigma(a)(theta), of the undisturbed soil samples were also performed. An excellent correlation (R2 = 0.988) was found between the theta values measured by TDR on the different undisturbed soils and the corresponding theta obtained from the soil gravimetric water content. A typical bimodal theta(Psi) function was found for most of the undisturbed soil samples. Comparison between the theta(Psi) curves measured with the TDR-Cell and those obtained from the 2-mm sieved soils showed that the pressure plate method overestimates theta at low Psi values. The sigma(a)(theta) relationship was well described by a simple power expression (R2 > 0.95), in which the power factor, defined as tortuosity, ranged between 1.18 and 3.75.

AB objective of this paper is to demonstrate the formulation of a numerical model for mass transport based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) Boltzmann equation. To this end, the classical chemical transport equation is derived as the zeroth moment of the BGK Boltzmann differential equation. The relationship between the mass transport equation and the BGK Boltzmann equation allows an alternative approach to numerical modeling of mass transport, wherein mass fluxes are formulated indirectly from the zeroth moment of a difference model for the BGK Boltzmann equation rather than directly from the transport equation. In particular, a second-order numerical solution for the transport equation based on the discrete BGK Boltzmann equation is developed. The numerical discretization of the first-order BGK Boltzmann differential equation is straightforward and leads to diffusion effects being accounted for algebraically rather than through a second-order Fickian term. The resultant model satisfies the entropy condition, thus preventing the emergence of non-physically realizable solutions including oscillations in the vicinity of the front. Integration of the BGK Boltzmann difference equation into the particle velocity space provides the mass fluxes from the control volume and thus the difference equation for mass concentration. The difference model is a local approximation and thus may be easily included in a parallel model or in accounting for complex geometry. Numerical tests for a range of advection-diffusion transport problems, including one- and two-dimensional pure advection transport and advection-diffusion transport show the accuracy of the proposed model in comparison to analytical solutions and solutions obtained by other schemes.

AB The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) has been commonly used to assimilate real time dynamic data into geologic models over the past decade. Despite its various advantages such as computational efficiency and its capability to handle multiple sources of uncertainty, the EnKF may not be used to reliably update models that are characterized by curvilinear geometries such as fluvial deposits where the permeable channels play a crucial role in the prediction of solute transport. It is well-known that the EnKF performs optimally for updating multi-Gaussian distributed fields, basically because it uses two-point statistics (i.e., covariances) to represent the relationship between the model parameters and between the model parameters and the observed response, and this is the only statistic necessary to fully characterize a multiGaussian distribution. The Ensemble PATtern matching (EnPAT) is an alternative ensemble based method that shows significant potential to condition complex geology such as channelized aquifers to dynamic data. The EnPAT is an evolution of the EnKF, replacing, in the analysis step, two-point statistics with multiple-point statistics. The advantages of EnPAT reside in its capability to honor the complex spatial connectivity of geologic structures as well as the measured static and dynamic data In this work, the performance of the classical EnKF and the EnPAT are compared for modeling a synthetic channelized aquifer. The results reveal that the EnPAT yields a better prediction of transport characteristics than the EnKF because it characterizes the conductivity heterogeneity better. Issues such as uncertainty of multiple variables and the effect of measurement errors on EnPAT results will be discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID WATER-STRESS; CLIMATE
AB Flow duration curve provides an important synthesis of the relevant hydrological processes occurring at the basin scale, and, although it is typically obtained from field observations, different theoretical approaches finalized to its indirect reconstruction have been developed in recent years. In this study a recent ecohydrological model for the probabilistic characterization of base flows is tested through its application to a study catchment located in southern Italy, where long historical series of daily stream-flow are available. The model, coupling soil moisture balance with a simplified scheme of the hydrological response of the basin, provides the daily flow duration curve. The original model is here modified in order to account for rainfall reduction due to canopy interception and stress its potential applicability to most of the ephemeral Mediterranean basins, where measurements of air temperature and rainfall often represent the only meteorological data available. The model shows a high sensitivity to two parameters related to the transport and evapotranspiration processes. Two different operational approaches for the identification of such parameters are explored and compared: by the first approach, these parameters are considered as time invariant quantities, while, in the second approach, empirical relationships between such parameters and the underlying climatic forcings are first derived and then adopted in the parameters calibration procedure. The model ability in reproducing the empirical flow duration curves and the model sensitivity to climate forcings, here referred as elasticity of the model, are investigated and it is shown how the adoption of the second approach leads to a general improvement of the model elasticity.

AB We present two statistical models for downscaling flood hazard indicators derived from upscaled shallow water simulations. These downscaling models are based on the decomposition of hazard indicators into linear combinations of spatial patterns obtained from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are used to model the relationship between low resolution (LR) and high resolution (HR) information drawn from hazard indicators. In both statistical models, the PCA features, i.e. the linear weights of the spatial patterns, of the LR hazard indicator are taken as inputs to the ANNs. In the first model, there is one ANN per HR cell where the hazard indicator is to be estimated and the output of the ANN is the hazard indicator value at that cell. In the second model, there is a single ANN for the whole HR mesh whose outputs are the PCA features of the HR hazard indicator. An estimate of the hazard indicator is obtained by combining the ANN's outputs with the HR spatial patterns. The two statistical downscaling models are evaluated and compared at estimating the water depth and the norm of the unit discharge, two common hazard indicators, on simulations from five synthetic urban configurations and one field-test case. Analyses are carried out in terms of relative absolute errors of the statistical downscaling model with respect to the LR hazard indicator. They show that (i) both statistical downscaling models provide estimates that are more accurate than the LR hazard indicator in most cases and (ii) the second downscaling model yields consistently lower errors for both hazard indicators for all flow scenarios on all configurations considered. The statistical models are three orders of magnitude faster than HR flow simulations. Used in conjunction with upscaled flood models such as porosity models, they appear as a promising operational alternative to direct flood hazard assessment from HR flow simulations.

ID THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The matrix-fracture transfer shape factor is one of the important parameters in the modeling of fluid flow in fractured porous media using a dual-porosity concept. Warren and Root [36] introduced the dual-porosity concept and suggested a relation for the shape factor. There is no general relationship for determining the shape factor for a single-phase flow of slightly compressible fluids. Therefore, different studies reported different values for this parameter, as an input into the flow models. Several investigations have been reported on the shape factor for slightly compressible fluids. However, the case of compressible fluids has not been investigated in the past. The focus of this study is, therefore, to find the shape factor for the single-phase flow of compressible fluids (gases) in fractured porous media. In this study, a model for the determination of the shape factor for compressible fluids is presented; and, the solution of nonlinear gas diffusivity equation is used to derive the shape factor. The integral method and the method of moments are used to solve the nonlinear governing equation by considering the pressure dependency of the viscosity and isothermal compressibility of the fluid. The approximate semi-analytical model for the shape factor presented in this study is verified using single-porosity, fine-grid, numerical simulations. The dependency of the shape factor on the gas specific gravity, pressure and temperature are also investigated. The theoretical analysis presented improves our understanding of fluid flow in fractured porous media. In addition, the developed matrix-fracture transfer shape factor can be used as an input for modeling flow of compressible fluids in dual-porosity systems, such as naturally fractured gas reservoirs, coal-bed methane reservoirs and fractured tight gas reservoirs.

AB Information on menisci dynamics and equilibrium contact angles, theta(e), is needed for modeling multiphase flow of fluids in geologic formations. The wettability of fracture faces is relevant to applications such as waterflooding in enhanced oil recovery and evaluation of caprock integrity for geologic carbon sequestration. We investigated the vertical capillary rise of air-water menisci on exposed fracture faces for a sandstone, a shale, and three granites. The experimental design approximated that employed in the Wilhelmy plate method. Replicate fracture faces were prepared by fracturing cylindrical rock cores using the Brazilian method and splitting the fractured cores apart along their fracture planes. Meniscus onset was imaged from a cross-sectional perspective using dynamic neutron radiography, and quantified with change point analysis. An existing model for meniscus onset fitted the experimental data very well (median R-2 = 0.96). Capillary rise was typified by t(2/3) scaling (where t is time), followed by a constant equilibrium height, z(e). The average time taken for the menisci to reach z(e) was 0.39 s, with no differences between rock types. The menisci achieved a greater vertical extent on the fracture faces of the sedimentary rocks as compared to those of the granites. Apparent theta(e) values were calculated from the best fit estimates of z(e) using the Wilhelmy plate equation for a smooth and planar vertical surface. Despite the fractal roughness of some of the fracture faces, there was a significant linear relationship (R-2 = 0.80) between the apparent theta(e) values and intrinsic theta(e) values measured on polished surfaces of the same rocks using the sessile drop method. The regression equation indicated the apparent theta(e) values were consistently greater than the intrinsic values. This overestimation may be due to averaging of pixels at the air-water-solid interface, a required step in the image analysis. Further exploration of the range of applicability and measurement accuracy of this proposed new technique would be valuable.

AB Examining the physical mechanisms through which large scale climate indicators, e.g., El Nirio-Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole, affect hydroclimatic variables in the tropics and extratropics is a scientific challenge. In this study, climatic relationships between large-scale climate indices (CIs) and Taiwan rainfall variability were examined. Not only leading patterns of observed monthly total and extreme rainfall were estimated through an empirical orthogonal teleconnection method (EOT), but also correlation and regression analyses were performed for the leading rainfall patterns and various CIs based on atmospheric-ocean circulation dataset. From the spatial structure of the leading EOT patterns for total and extreme rainfall, the north-coast mode in the cold seasons and the middle-inland mode for the warm seasons were detected. The temporal cycle of the leading EOT patterns indicates decreasing trends in the cold seasons and oscillations mainly on decadal timescales in the warm seasons. The leading EOT patterns of total rainfall showed more widespread coherent patterns than those of extreme rainfall with more variance in rainfall variability. The findings from this study illustrate that tropical ENSO forcing has a coherent association with March and October-November rainfall patterns, while the Indian Ocean Dipole is identified as a driver for rainfall variability during spring and fall. The western North Pacific monsoon activity has a negative (positive) correlation with March (October and December) rainfall variabilities and tropical cyclone indices also exhibit significant positive correlation with October rainfalls. The leading patterns of the October and following-year March rainfall time series are predictable at up to nine-month lead time from the tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs).

AB The Los Alamos Raman lidar has been used to make high resolution (25 m) estimates of the evapotranspiration rate over adjacent corn and soybean canopies. The lidar makes three-dimensional measurements of the water vapor content of the atmosphere directly above the canopy that are inverted using Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. This may be used to examine the relationship between evapotranspiration and surface moisture/soil type. Lidar estimates of evapotranspiration reveal a high degree of spatial variability over corn and soybean fields that may be associated with small elevation changes in the area. The spatial structure of the variability is characterized using a structure function and correlation function approach. The power law relationship found by other investigators for soil moisture is not clear in the data for evapotranspiration, nor is the data a straight line over the measured lags. The magnitude of the structure function and the slope changes with time of day, with a probable connection to the amount of evapotranspiration and the spatial variability of the water vapor source. The data used was taken during the soil moisture-atmosphere coupling experiment (SMACEX) conducted in the Walnut Creek Watershed near Ames, Iowa in June and July 2002. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Our understanding of short- and long-term dynamics of spatial soil moisture patterns is limited due to measurement constraints. Using new highly detailed data, this research aims to examine seasonal and event-scale spatial soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil and subsoil of the small spruce-covered Wustebach catchment, Germany. To accomplish this, univariate and geo-statistical analyses were performed for a 1 year long 4-D data set obtained with the wireless sensor network SoilNet. We found large variations in spatial soil moisture patterns in the topsoil, mostly related to meteorological forcing. In the subsoil, temporal dynamics were diminished due to soil water redistribution processes and root water uptake. Topsoil range generally increased with decreasing soil moisture. The relationship between the spatial standard deviation of the topsoil soil moisture (SD theta) and mean water content ((theta) over bar) showed a convex shape, as has often been found in humid temperate climate conditions. Observed scatter in topsoil SD theta((theta) over bar) was explained by seasonal and event-scale SD theta((theta) over bar) dynamics, possibly involving hysteresis at both time scales. Clockwise hysteretic SD theta((theta) over bar) dynamics at the event scale were generated under moderate soil moisture conditions only for intense precipitation that rapidly wetted the topsoil and increased soil moisture variability controlled by spruce throughfall patterns. This hysteretic effect increased with increasing precipitation, reduced root water uptake, and high groundwater level. Intense precipitation on dry topsoil abruptly increased SD theta but only marginally increased mean soil moisture. This was due to different soil rewetting behavior in drier upslope areas (hydrophobicity and preferential flow caused minor topsoil recharge) compared with the moderately wet valley bottom (topsoil water storage), which led to a more spatially organized pattern. This study showed that spatial soil moisture patterns monitored by a wireless sensor network varied with depth, soil moisture content, seasonally, and within single wetting and drying episodes. This was controlled by multiple factors including soil properties, topography, meteorological forcing, vegetation, and groundwater.

TI Effects of sodium chloride on constitutive relations in variably
   saturated porous media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RELATIVELY DRY SOIL; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; WATER MOVEMENT; SALT;
   TRANSPORT; GRADIENTS
AB [ 1] Though many arid and contaminated sites have high salinity, prediction of effects of salinity on water movement in soils has been based on dilute solution approximations. Here a sensitivity analysis compares predicted liquid and vapor pressure in variably saturated porous media found using both the dilute approximations and a more general formulation that is valid for salt concentrations from zero to saturation. Sodium chloride ( NaCl) was selected as a representative salt of environmental importance. Salt-mineral interactions are not included in the analysis. The dilute approximations neglect the salt-related changes in specific volume, which translate into nonnegligible pressure effects (i.e., error > 1%) under dry conditions, being more pronounced for finer media. The analysis shows that for silt textures, the dilute approximation to the vapor pressure constitutive relation is acceptable for water contents theta > 5%, for sand theta > 1%, and for loam theta > 2%. When computing gradients of vapor pressure resulting from gradients in salt concentration, volume correction is necessary for silt for theta < 10%. Gradients in vapor pressure with changes in water content require volume correction, except under dilute conditions (i.e., < 0.5 molal). For concentrated solutions in silt, salt effect errors are not acceptable for prediction of liquid pressure, nor are the effects on gradients negligible. Errors for sand and loam are only marginally better, with acceptable errors generally occurring only for ionic strengths of less than 1 molal. An example of use of the constitutive relations to plot results from experiments is provided to illustrate how the theory may be used to determine which thermodynamic corrections must be incorporated into analyses of the experimental results. Here the volumetric effects of the salt on vapor depression were negligible, though volumetric effects may be nonnegligible for computation of gradients of both vapor and liquid pressures. The method of analysis of nonideal effects developed herein is general, and the resulting corrections to the dilute approximation may be easily implemented in numerical codes.

AB Concentration-discharge (c-Q) plots are routinely used as an integrated signal of watershed response to infer solute sources and travel pathways. However, the interpretation of c-Q data can be difficult unless these data are fitted using statistical models. Such models are frequently applied for geogenic solutes, but it is unclear to what extent they might aid in the investigation of nutrient export patterns, particularly for total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) which is a critical driver of downstream eutrophication problems. The goal of the present study was therefore to statistically model c-Q relations (where c is TDP concentrations) in a set of contrasting watersheds in the Northern Great Plains-ranging in size from 0.2 to 1000+km(2)-to assess the controls of landscape properties on TDP transport dynamics. Six statistical models were fitted to c-Q data, notably (a) one linear model, (b) one model assuming that c-Q relations are driven by the mixing of end-member waters from different landscape locations (i.e., hydrograph separation), (c) one model relying on a biogeochemical stationarity hypothesis (i.e., power law), (d) one model hypothesizing that c-Q relations change as a function of the solute subsurface contact time (i.e., hyperbolic model), and (e) two models assuming that solute fluxes are mostly dependent on reaction rates (i.e., chemical models). Model performance ranged from mediocre (R-2 < 0.2) to very good (R-2 > 0.9), but the hydrograph separation model seemed most universal. No watershed was found to exhibit chemostatic behaviour, but many showed signs of dilution or enrichment behaviour. A tendency toward a multi-model fit and better model performance was observed for watersheds with moderate slope and higher effective drainage area. The relatively poor model performance obtained outside these conditions illustrates the likely importance of controls on TDP concentrations in the region that are independent of flow dynamics.

AB Fluid-solid reactions play a key role in a large range of biogeochemical processes. Transport limitations at the pore scale limit the amount of solute available for reaction, so that reaction rates measured under well-mixed conditions tend to strongly overestimate rates occurring in natural and engineered systems. Although different models have been proposed to capture this phenomenon, linking pore-scale structure, flow heterogeneity, and local reaction kinetics to upscaled effective kinetics remains a challenging problem. We present a new theoretical framework to quantify these dynamics based on the chemical continuous time random walk framework. We study a fluid-solid reaction with the fluid phase undergoing advective-diffusive transport. We consider a catalytic degradation reaction, A(F)+ B-S -> B-S, where A(F) is in fluid phase and B-S is in solid phase and homogeneous over the fluid-solid interface, allowing us to focus on the role of transport limitations and medium structure. Our approach is based on the concept of inter-reaction times, which result from the times between contacts of transported reactants with the solid phase. We use this formulation to quantify the global kinetics of fluidreactant mass and test our predictions against numerical simulations of advective-diffusive transport in stratified channel flow and Stokes flow through a beadpack. The theory captures the decrease of effective reaction rates compared to the well-mixed prediction with increasing Damkohler number due to transport limitations. Although we consider simple kinetics and media, these findings will contribute to the understanding and modeling of the effect of transport limitations in more complex reactive transport problems.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODEL; BASIN
AB A previously calibrated two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water-quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) of Detroit Lake in western Oregon was used in conjunction with inflows derived from Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) hydrologic models to examine in-lake and downstream water temperature effects under future climate conditions. Current and hypothetical operations and structures at Detroit Dam were imposed on boundary conditions derived from downscaled General Circulation Models in base (1990-1999) and future (2059-2068) periods. Compared with the base period, future air temperatures were about 2 degrees C warmer year-round. Higher air temperature and lower precipitation under the future period resulted in a 23% reduction in mean annual PRMS-simulated discharge and a 1 degrees C increase in mean annual estimated stream temperatures flowing into the lake compared to the base period. Simulations incorporating current operational rules and minimum release rates at Detroit Dam to support downstream habitat, irrigation, and water supply during key times of year resulted in lower future lake levels. That scenario results in a lake level that is above the dam's spillway crest only about half as many days in the future compared to historical frequencies. Managing temperature downstream of Detroit Dam depends on the ability to blend warmer water from the lake's surface with cooler water from deep in the lake, and the spillway is an important release point near the lake's surface. Annual average in-lake and release temperatures from Detroit Lake warmed 1.1 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C from base to future periods under present-day dam operational rules and fill schedules. Simulated dam operations such as beginning refill of the lake 30 days earlier or reducing minimum release rates (to keep more water in the lake to retain the use of the spillway) mitigated future warming to 0.4 and 0.9 degrees C below existing operational scenarios during the critical autumn spawning period for endangered salmonids. A hypothetical floating surface withdrawal at Detroit Dam improved temperature control in summer and autumn (0.6 degrees C warmer in summer, 0.6 degrees C cooler in autumn compared to existing structures) without altering release rates or lake level management rules.

AB This paper explores the relationship between temperature, evaporation and soil moisture using a planetary boundary layer (PBL) model. It focuses on illustrating and quantifying the effect of soil moisture on the evolution of daytime temperatures. A simple convective PBL model coupled with the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation is used to estimate evapotranspiration. Following calibration and sensitivity analysis, the model was used to simulate the relative impact of dry and wet soil moisture conditions on daytime temperatures by changing the surface resistance parameter in the PM equation. It was found that the maximum temperature that can be reached during a day is constrained by the amount of soil moisture and the available net radiation, confirming previously published results. Higher temperatures can be reached with greater net radiation and dry soil moisture conditions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The phenomenon of virtual water flows (VWFs) reveals the remote pressure on local water resources on one hand, and provides the possibility of global water saving if VWFs from water-rich places of higher water use efficiencies to water-poor or lower water use efficiencies regions on the other hand. A VWF is marked as efficient when at least half of the water footprint (WF) in producing the traded products is below the corresponding WF benchmark. Whereas the VWF is marked as sustainable when flowing from the places where the water consumption did not exceed local sustainable renewable water availability. However, most attention has been taken to the sustainability of VWFs, ignoring their efficiency and spatial-temporal variations. Here we, taking inter-provincial crop-related VWFs of twenty major crops in the mainland China over 2004-2013 as a study case, analysing the efficiency of VWFs and the sustainability of blue VWFs, as well as their mutual relationship. Results show that over the study period, although inter-provincial crop-related VWFs increased slightly by 2%, the North to South VWFs and blue VWFs increased by 41% and 2.5 times, respectively. The weight of inefficient inter-provincial VWFs reduced to 75% in 2013 from 94% in 2004, whereas the unsustainable blue VWFs increased by 8%. Trade-offs between the efficiency and sustainability of VWFs existed in five provinces. Wheat, rice, maize, and cotton were the main contributors to inefficient and unsustainable VWFs. Assessments in VWFs should account for local water resources conditions, considering both efficiency and sustainability to determine hotspots and critical products and allow appropriate management of crop production and water allocation.

AB Evaporation from small reservoirs, wetlands, and lakes continues to be a theoretical and practical problem in surface hydrology and micrometeorology because atmospheric flows above such systems can rarely be approximated as stationary and planar-homogeneous with no mean subsidence (hereafter referred to as idealized flow state). Here, the turbulence statistics of temperature (T) and water vapor (q) most pertinent to take evaporation measurements over three water bodies differing in climate, thermal inertia and degree of advective conditions are explored. The three systems included Lac Leman in Switzerland (high thermal inertia, near homogeneous conditions with no appreciable advection due to long upwind fetch), Eshkol reservoir in Israel (intermediate thermal inertia, frequent strong advective conditions) and Tilopozo wetland in Chile (low thermal inertia, frequent but moderate advection). The data analysis focused on how similarity constants for the flux-variance approach, C-T/C-q, and relative transport efficiencies R-wT/R-wq, are perturbed from unity with increased advection or the active role of temperature. When advection is small and thermal inertia is large, C-T/C-q < 1 (or RwT/R-wq > 1) primarily due to the active role of temperature, which is consistent with a large number of studies conducted over bare soil and vegetated surfaces. However, when advection is significantly large, then C-T/C-q > 1 (or R-wT/R-wq < 1). When advection is moderate and thermal inertia is low, then C-T/C-q similar to 1. This latter equality, while consistent with Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST), is due to the fact that advection tends to increase C-T/C-q above unity while the active role of temperature tends to decrease C-T/C-q below unity. A simplified scaling analysis derived from the scalar variance budget equation, explained qualitatively how advection could perturb MOST scaling (assumed to represent the idealized flow state).

AB Models that simulate loadings of pollutants from agricultural landscapes to surface waters often operate at time scales that are relatively coarse (e.g. daily) compared with how fast water moves in streams, suggesting a commensurate physical scale that is substantially larger than typical agricultural fields. In general, as pollutants enter water and move downstream, longitudinal dispersive effects and travel time de-synchronization tend to cause flattening and broadening of concentration peaksan effect with implications for potential impacts on ecological and human health, and for which adequate representation is thus important for risk assessment. In-stream transport is often approximated in practice using numerical implementation of the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation (ADE), with streams discretized into linked homogeneous segments. However, when a daily time step is employed, limitations inherent in the finite difference methodology may constrain simulated dispersion in lotic waters to unrepresentative or unrealistic magnitudes. In this paper, a convolution-based approach to surface water transport is suggested as an alternative to the ADE, for use in combination with daily input loading models. This approach offers the advantage of greater flexibility in representing longitudinal mixing by using impulse response functions (IRF) to represent inter-segment transport. Networks of stream segments are represented using nested convolutions, implemented using forward and inverse discrete Fourier transform to simplify calculations. Enhanced representational flexibility arises from the freedom afforded the modeller in selecting each segment's IRF, which may be chosen to represent dispersive regimes ranging from pure advection (plug flow) to compete mixing, and beyond to the sort of long-tailed mixing characterized by fractal inverse frequency power-law scaling. The approach is explored in proof-of-concept exercises that make use of atrazine monitoring data sets collected over common time periods from upstream and downstream locations within the same watersheds.

AB Observed scale effects of runoff on hillslopes and small watersheds derive from complex interactions of time-varying rainfall rates with runoff, infiltration and macro-and microtopographic structures. A little studied aspect of scale effects is the concept of water depth-dependent infiltration. For semi-arid range-land it has been demonstrated that mounds underneath shrubs have a high infiltrability and lower lying compacted or stony inter-shrub areas have a lower infiltrability. It is hypothesized that runoff accumulation further downslope leads to increased water depth, inundating high infiltrability areas, which increases the area-averaged infiltration rate. A model was developed that combines the concepts of water depth-dependent infiltration, partial contributing area under variable rainfall intensity, and the Green-Ampt theory for point-scale infiltration. The model was applied to rainfall simulation data and natural rainfall-runoff data from a small sub-watershed (0.4 ha) of the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in the semi-arid US Southwest. Its performance to reproduce observed hydrographs was compared to that of a conventional Green-Ampt model assuming complete inundation sheet flow, with runon infiltration, which is infiltration of runoff onto pervious downstream areas. Parameters were derived from rainfall simulations and from watershed-scale calibration directly from the rainfall-runoff events. The performance of the water depth-dependent model was better than that of the conventional model on the scale of a rainfall simulator plot, but on the scale of a small watershed the performance of both model types was similar. We believe that the proposed model contributes to a less scale-dependent way of modeling runoff and erosion on the hillslope-scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Monthly evapotranspiration (ET) rates for 1979-2015 were estimated by the latest, calibration-free version of the complementary relationship (CR) of evaporation over the conterminous United States. The results were compared to similar estimates of three land surface models (Noah, VIC, Mosaic), two reanalysis products (National Centers of Environmental Protection Reanalysis II, ERA-Interim), two remote-sensing-based (Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model, Penman-Monteith-Leuning) algorithms, and the spatially upscaled eddy-covariance ET measurements of FLUXNET-MTE. Model validations were performed via simplified water-balance derived ET rates employing Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model precipitation, United States Geological Survey two- and six-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC2 and HUC6) discharge, and terrestrial water storage anomalies from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, the latter for 2003-2015. The CR outperforms all other multiyear mean annual HUC2-averaged ET estimates with root-mean-square error = 51 mm/year, R = 0.98, relative bias of -1%, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.94, respectively. Inclusion of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment data into the annual water balances for the shorter 2003-2015 period does not have much effect on model performance. Similarly, the CR outperforms all other models for the linear trend of the annual ET rates over the HUC2 basins. Over the significantly smaller HUC6 basins where the water-balance validation is more uncertain, the CR still outperforms all other models except FLUXNET-MTE, which has the advantage of possible local ET measurements, a benefit that clearly diminishes at the HUC2 scale. As the employed CR is calibration-free and requires only very few meteorological inputs, yet it yields superior ET performance at the regional scale, it may serve as a diagnostic and benchmarking tool for more complex and data intensive models of terrestrial evapotranspiration rates.

AB [1] Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and export were quantified in 56 streams within the Dee Valley, Scotland. Percentage land cover was calculated for each of the watersheds. For a subset of 21 watersheds, organic and mineral soil layers were collected for carbon and nitrogen analysis. Peat cover derived from land cover data was a good predictor of annual DOC export for the selected 21 upland watersheds but not for the set of 56 watersheds. Using DOC values and mean watershed C: N ratio, we produced an empirical predictive model for estimation of annual DOC export for the 21 watersheds as well as a model of weekly fluxes in two of the larger watersheds to meet the needs of watershed managers. Annual exports for the 56 streams in the Dee Valley ranged from 1700 to 10,500 kg km(-2) yr(-1). Land cover was not related to annual DOC export for the 56 streams, but by season, arable land and grassland were both correlated to spring DOC export ( R = - 0.39 arable land and R = - 0.33 grassland p < 0.01). Summertime DOC export was correlated to heather, montane, and conifer land cover ( R = - 0.029 heather, R = - 0.39 montane, and R = 0.33 conifer, p < 0.05). Autumn and winter DOC export was best described by peat ( R = 0.29 and 0.39, respectively, p < 0.05). In the subset of 21 watersheds with soil information, watershed soil organic matter C: N ratio and peat had a higher correlation with annual DOC concentrations and export than any other land cover class. Source of peat distribution data may impact the relationship between DOC and peat cover, and this issue is examined. Modeled weekly DOC load compared well with observed DOC load in a time series evaluation.

AB Different hydrological models of sediment entrainment, infiltration, overland flow production, soil loss, landslide occurrence, among others, need rainfall events data. The Minimum Inter-event Time (MIT) used to separate rainfall events affects their properties. Therefore, it is highly important their correct definition. Various event definitions are commonly used in hydrology, and a high variety of MIT is applied. In this work, an easy method is proposed for deciding the proper MIT in a certain place when dealing with hourly rainfall data series. This new methodology is based on the scale invariance properties of rainfall, analysed with both multifractal and Self-Organized Criticality theories. The similarity between some parameters from both analyses allows picking out the more appropriate MIT for the hourly rainfall data sets analysed, in Malaga (Southern Spain) and Bullileo (Central Chile). The method can be applied for different rainfall time resolutions according to the purpose of the model that needs the rain event information. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID PREDICTION; TRANSPORT; EVENTS
AB In this paper, a Bayesian learning approach is introduced to train a multilayer feed-forward network for daily river flow and reservoir inflow simulation in a cold region river basin in Canada. In Bayesian approach, uncertainty about the relationship between inputs and outputs is initially taken care of by an assumed prior distribution of parameters ( weights and biases). This prior distribution is updated to posterior distribution using a likelihood function following Bayes' theorem while data are observed. This posterior distribution is called the objective function of a network in the Bayesian learning approach. The objective function is maximized using a suitable optimization technique. Once the network is trained, the predictive distribution of the network outputs is obtained by integrating over the posterior distribution of weights. In this study, Gaussian prior distribution and a Gaussian noise model are used in defining posterior distribution. The network has been optimized using a scaled conjugate gradient technique. Posterior distribution of weights is approximated to Gaussian during prediction. Prediction performance of the Bayesian neural network ( BNN) is compared with the results obtained from a standard artificial neural network ( ANN) model and a widely used conceptual rainfall-runoff model, namely, HBV-96. The BNN model outperformed the conceptual model and slightly outperformed the standard ANN model in simulating mean, peak, and low river flows and reservoir inflows. The significant contribution of the Bayesian method over the conventional ANN approach, among others, is the uncertainty estimation of the outputs in the form of confidence intervals which are particularly needed in practical water resources applications. Prediction confidence limits ( or intervals) indicate the extent to which one can rely on predictions for decision making. It is shown that the BNN can provide reliable streamflow and reservoir inflow forecasts without a loss in model prediction accuracy as compared to standard ANN and conceptual model HBV. Another significant advantage of BNN approach is that the overfitting and underfitting problems are automatically taken care of by the Bayesian learning algorithm, which conversely remain serious problems with conventional ANN learning algorithm.

AB In a recent work [Dagan and Fiori, 1997] we developed a Lagrangian theoretical framework to compute the concentration variance in transport of a conservative solute in a heterogeneous formation of random stationary structure. This variance, a measure of concentration fluctuations in the plume, depends on the spreading effect of advection and on the mixing effect of pore-scale dispersion. Comparison between theory and the numerical simulations of Graham and McLaughlin [1989] showed very good agreement. Here we compare the same theoretical formulae with the field measurements at Borden Site and Cape God. We rely on the analysis of these experiments carried out by Fitts [1996], who characterized the concentration fluctuations by a global measure. The latter is the standard deviation of the logarithm of the ratio between measured and modeled concentrations over the entire plume and at different times. The theoretical relationships require computing the two particles trajectories' covariances. We simplify the computations considerably by taking advantage of the anisotropy of the heterogeneous structures of the two aquifers. Thus the major effect of advection is in the shearing of the plume in the longitudinal direction, whereas pore-scale dispersion acts mainly through its transverse effect in the vertical direction. We found a good agreement between theory and experiments by using parameter values determined independently in the past, provided that the values of transverse pore-scale dispersivities were 0.5 mm for Cape Cod and 0.44 mm for Borden Site. These values are somewhat smaller than the vertical macrodispersivities inferred from measurements.

AB Interphase mass transfer in porous media is commonly modeled using Sherwood number expressions that are developed in terms of fluid and porous medium properties averaged over some representative elementary volume (REV). In this work the influence of sub-grid scale properties on interphase mass transfer was investigated using a two-dimensional pore network model. The focus was on assessing the impact of (i) NAPL saturation, (ii) interfacial area (iii) NAPL spatial distribution at the pore scale, (iv) grain size heterogeneity, (v) REV or domain size and (vi) pore scale heterogeneity of the porous media on interphase mass transfer. Variability of both the mass transfer coefficient that explicitly accounts for the interfacial area and the mass transfer coefficient that lumps the interfacial' area was examined. It was shown that pore scale NAPL distribution and its orientation relative to the flow direction have significant impact on flow bypassing and the interphase mass transfer coefficient. This results in a complex non-linear relationship between interfacial area and the REV -based interphase mass transfer rate. Hence, explicitly accounting for the interfacial area does not eliminate the uncertainty of the mass transfer coefficient. It was also shown that, even for explicitly defined flow patterns, changing the domain size over which the mass transfer process is defined influences the extent of NAPL bypassing and dilution and, consequently, the interphase mass transfer. It was also demonstrated that the spatial variability of pore scale parameters such as pore throat diameters may result in different rates of interphase mass transfer even for the same pore size distribution index.

AB Hillslope scale runoffis generated as a result of interacting factors that include water influx rate, surface and subsurface properties, and antecedent saturation. Heterogeneity of these factors affects the existence and characteristics of runoff. This heterogeneity becomes an increasingly relevant consideration as hydrologic models are extended and employed to capture greater detail in runoffgenerating processes. We investigate the impact of one type of heterogeneity - subsurface permeability - on runoffusing the integrated hydrologic model ParFlow. Specifically, we examine the sensitivity of runoffto variation in three-dimensional subsurface permeability fields for scenarios dominated by either Hortonian or Dunnian runoffmechanisms. Ten thousand statistically consistent subsurface permeability fields are parameterized using a truncated Karhunen-Loeve (KL) series and used as inputs to 48-h simulations of integrated surface-subsurface flow in an idealized 'tilted-v' domain. Coefficients of the spatial modes of the KL permeability fields provide the parameter space for analysis using the active subspace method. The analysis shows that for Dunnian-dominated runoffconditions the cumulative runoffvolume is sensitive primarily to the first spatial mode, corresponding to permeability values in the center of the three-dimensional model domain. In the Hortonian case, runoffvolume is sensitive to multiple smaller-scale spatial modes and the locus of that sensitivity is in the near-surface zone upslope from the domain outlet. Variation in runoffvolume resulting from random heterogeneity configurations can be expressed as an approximately univariate function of the active variable, a weighted combination of spatial parameterization coefficients computed through the active subspace method. However, this relationship between the active variable and runoffvolume is more well-defined for Dunnian runoffthan for the Hortonian scenario. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous studies across multiple disciplines search for insights on the effects of climate change at local spatial scales and at fine time resolutions. This study presents an overall methodology of using a weather generator for downscaling an ensemble of climate model outputs. The downscaled predictions can explicitly include climate model uncertainty, which offers valuable information for making probabilistic inferences about climate impacts. The hourly weather generator that serves as the downscaling tool is briefly presented. The generator is designed to reproduce a set of meteorological variables that can serve as input to hydrological, ecological, geomorphological, and agricultural models. The generator is capable of reproducing a wide set of climate statistics over a range of temporal scales, from extremes, to low-frequency interannual variability; its performance for many climate variables and their statistics over different aggregation periods is highly satisfactory. The use of the weather generator in simulations of future climate scenarios, as inferred from climate models, is described in detail. Using a previously developed methodology based on a Bayesian approach, the stochastic downscaling procedure derives the frequency distribution functions of factors of change for several climate statistics from a multi-model ensemble of outputs of General Circulation Models. The factors of change are subsequently applied to the statistics derived from observations to re-evaluate the parameters of the weather generator. Using embedded causal and statistical relationships, the generator simulates future realizations of climate for a specific point location at the hourly scale. Uncertainties present in the climate model realizations and the multi-model ensemble predictions are discussed. An application of the weather generator in reproducing present (1961-2000) and forecasting future (2081-2100) climate conditions is illustrated for the location of Tucson (AZ). The stochastic downscaling is carried out using simulations of eight General Circulation Models adopted in the IPCC 4AR, A1B emission scenario. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A three-dimensional Eulerian two-phase flow model for sediment transport in sheet flow conditions is presented. To resolve turbulence and turbulence-sediment interactions, the large-eddy simulation approach is adopted. Specifically, a dynamic Smagorinsky closure is used for the subgrid fluid and sediment stresses, while the subgrid contribution to the drag force is included using a drift velocity model with a similar dynamic procedure. The contribution of sediment stresses due to intergranular interactions is modeled by the kinetic theory of granular flow at low to intermediate sediment concentration, while at high sediment concentration of enduring contact, a phenomenological closure for particle pressure and frictional viscosity is used. The model is validated with a comprehensive high-resolution dataset of unidirectional steady sheet flow (Revil-Baudard et al., 2015, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 767, 1-30). At a particle Stokes number of about 10, simulation results indicate a reduced von Karman coefficient of kappa approximate to 0.215 obtained from the fluid velocity profile. A fluid turbulence kinetic energy budget analysis further indicates that the drag-induced turbulence dissipation rate is significant in the sheet flow layer, while in the dilute transport layer, the pressure work plays a similar role as the buoyancy dissipation, which is typically used in the single-phase stratified flow formulation. The present model also reproduces the sheet layer thickness and mobile bed roughness similar to measured data. However, the resulting mobile bed roughness is more than two times larger than that predicted by the empirical formulae. Further analysis suggests that through intermittent turbulent motions near the bed, the resolved sediment Reynolds stress plays a major role in the enhancement of mobile bed roughness. Our analysis on near-bed intermittency also suggests that the turbulent ejection motions are highly correlated with the upward sediment suspension flux, while the turbulent sweep events are mostly associated with the downward sediment deposition flux.

AB The traditional statistical theory of extreme events assumes an asymptotic regime in which the number of events per year is large enough for a limiting Generalized Extreme Value distribution to apply. This has been shown not to be applicable to many practical cases. We introduce here a Metastatistical Extreme Value (MEV) approach which is defined in terms of the distribution of the statistical parameters describing "ordinary'' daily rainfall occurrence and intensity. The method does not require an asymptotic assumption, and naturally accounts for the influence of the bulk of the distribution of ordinary events on the distribution of annual maximum daily rainfall. Building on existing observations showing the distribution of daily rainfall to be Weibull right-tail equivalent, the MEV approach is then specialized to yield a compact and easily applicable formulation. We apply this formulation to Monte Carlo experiments based on Weibull statistics derived from the 3-century long rainfall time series observed in Padova (Italy). We find an excellent agreement between MEV estimates and the 'observed' frequency of occurrence of extreme events in the synthetic time series generated. GEV and Gumbel estimates, on the contrary, exhibit systematic errors. Tests with different rates of occurrence of rainfall events show slight improvements of the GEV and Gumbel estimation bias when the number of events/year is increased. However, a constant bias in GEV and Gumbel estimates is seen for (synthetic) climates where the number of events and the distribution of intensities is varied stochastically. The estimation root mean square error is also larger for the GEV and Gumbel distributions than for the MEV approach. Hence, GEV and Gumbel quantile estimates are more likely to be further away from the actual value than MEV estimates. Finally, the application of the new MEV approach to subsets of the long Padova time series identifies marked variabilities in rainfall extremes at the centennial time scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ID OPERATION; STORAGE; FORMULATION; YIELD
AB In our previous works, deterministic release policies were considered for the development of approximations of the two lower moments of the storage volume defined by the dynamic equation of the reservoir in discrete time but in continuous state space. Important innovation in that work was the incorporation of the lower and upper bounds of reservoir systems into the dynamic equation for the storage volume using indicator functions. The current work, which also does not use discretization, looks at an extension of previous developments that incorporates standard operating policies, and also a new randomized release policy, both of which make the moments calculations exact under the assumptions that (1) the sum of current random inflow and the previous storage volume can be described by just the two lower moments and (2) only the means and variances of the inflows are known. First- and second-moment expressions are derived for the stochastic storage state variable and include terms for the failure probabilities (probabilities of spills or deficits). Expected values of the storage state, variances of storage, release policies, and failure probabilities are obtained by solving the optimal reservoir operations problem using nonlinear programming. The various statistics thus obtained from this optimization compare extremely well with those obtained from simulation for the single-reservoir monthly operations problem studied. The exact characterization of the mean and variance of the storage state variable is derived, which is a difficulty in existing formulations based on linear quadratic Gaussian methods. For example, the latter methods have been unable to estimate these moments reasonably accurately, especially for long-term operations, whereas the traditional storage theory based on discretization brings on the "curse of dimensionality.'' The presentation herein is directed to both traditional reservoir storage theorists who are interested in the design of a reservoir where estimating the probabilities of spills and deficits is important and modern reservoir analysts who are interested in multiperiod optimal release decisions in the operations of reservoirs.

AB Precipitation (P), plant water use, and evaporation from the soil surface control the travel time of streamflow (Q) and evapotranspiration (ET) in a complex way. However, the impact of soil moisture and energy availability on the travel time distribution (TTD) of evaporated and transpired waters are yet less understood. In this study, we investigate how the seasonal variability of P and ET in terms of phase shift and rate influences the temporal dynamics of TTDs. To this end, we choose four contrasting climate types described as in-phase P and ET, out-of-phase P and ET, year-round constant P with seasonal ET, and year-round constant ET with seasonal P. We use a physically-based hydrological model to simulate dominant processes in the water and energy cycles as well as subsurface flow velocity, which are subsequently used in a Lagrangian particle-tracking model to characterize the age distribution of water particles in space and time. The results prove that the soil moisture availability than the ET rate imposes a stronger control on the TTD of transpired water in all climate scenarios. Plants indicate an overall tendency towards younger water particles unless in periods with a pronounced dry condition when old waters are more available in the deeper soil layers. In particular, the climate scenario with out-of-phase P and ET yields the highest percentage of old particles taken up by plants. Furthermore, ET age sampling mechanism shows hysteresis against the ET rate, with an opposite direction in climates with in-phase and out-of-phase P and ET. Our results also suggest that the ratio between the median travel time of Q and the median age of water storage has a dual relationship with the Q rate, indicating the existence of a threshold behavior that distinguishes the direct and inverse storage effects based on the storage volume.

AB Monitoring spatiotemporal variations of soil water content (theta) is important across a range of research fields, including agricultural engineering, hydrology, meteorology and climatology. Low frequency electromagnetic induction (EMI) systems have proven to be useful tools in mapping soil apparent electrical conductivity (sa) and soil moisture. However, obtaining depth profile water content is an area that has not been fully explored using EMI. To examine this, we performed time-lapse EMI measurements using a CMD mini-Explorer sensor along a 10m transect of a maize field over a 6 day period. Reference data were measured at the end of the profile via an excavated pit using 5TE capacitance sensors. In order to derive a time-lapse, depth-specific subsurface image of electrical conductivity (sigma), we applied a probabilistic sampling approach, DREAM((ZS)), on the measured EMI data. The inversely estimated sigma values were subsequently converted to theta using the Rhoades et al. (1976) petrophysical relationship. The uncertainties in measured sigma(a), as well as inaccuracies in the inverted data, introduced some discrepancies between estimated s and reference values in time and space. Moreover, the disparity between the measurement footprints of the 5TE and CMD Mini-Explorer sensors also led to differences. The obtained theta permitted an accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal distribution and variation of soil water content due to root water uptake and evaporation. The proposed EMI measurement and modeling technique also allowed for detecting temporal root zone soil moisture variations. The time-lapse theta monitoring approach developed using DREAM( ZS) thus appears to be a useful technique to understand spatiotemporal patterns of soil water content and provide insights into linked soil moisture vegetation processes and the dynamics of soil moisture/infiltration processes.

AB A significant body of current research is aimed at developing methods for numerical simulation of flow and transport in porous media that explicitly resolve complex pore and solid geometries, and at utilizing such models to study the relationships between fundamental pore-scale processes and macroscopic manifestations at larger (i.e., Darcy) scales. A number of different numerical methods for pore-scale simulation have been developed, and have been extensively tested and validated for simplified geometries. However, validation of pore-scale simulations of fluid velocity for complex, three-dimensional (3D) pore geometries that are representative of natural porous media is challenging due to our limited ability to measure pore-scale velocity in such systems. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offer the opportunity to measure not only the pore geometry, but also local fluid velocities under steady-state flow conditions in 3D and with high spatial resolution. In this paper, we present a 3D velocity field measured at sub-pore resolution (tens of micrometers) over a centimeter-scale 3D domain using MRI methods. We have utilized the measured pore geometry to perform 3D simulations of Navier-Stokes flow over the same domain using direct numerical simulation techniques. We present a comparison of the numerical simulation results with the measured velocity field. It is shown that the numerical results match the observed velocity patterns well overall except for a variance and small systematic scaling which can be attributed to the known experimental uncertainty in the MRI measurements. The comparisons presented here provide strong validation of the pore-scale simulation methods and new insights for interpretation of uncertainty in MRI measurements of pore-scale velocity. This study also provides a potential benchmark for future comparison of other pore-scale simulation methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Science. All rights reserved. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Specific discharge variations within a mesoscale catchment were studied on the basis of three synoptic sampling campaigns. These were conducted during stable flow conditions within the Krycklan catchment study area in northern Sweden. During each campaign, about 80 individual locations were measured for discharge draining from catchment areas ranging between 0.12 and 67 km(2). These discharge samplings allowed for the comparison between years within a given season (September 2005 versus September 2008) and between seasons within a given year (May 2008 versus September 2008) of specific discharge across this boreal landscape. There was considerable variability in specific discharge across this landscape. The ratio of the interquartile range (IQR) defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the specific discharges to the median of the specific discharges ranged from 37% to 43%. Factor analysis was used to explore potential relations between landscape characteristics and the specific discharge observed for 55 of the individual locations that were measured in all three synoptic sampling campaigns. Percentage wet area (i.e., wetlands, mires, and lakes) and elevation were found to be directly related to the specific discharge during the drier September 2008 sampling while potential annual evaporation was found to be inversely related. There was less of a relationship determined during the wetter post spring flood May 2008 sampling and the late summer rewetted September 2005 sampling. These results indicate the ability of forests to "dry out" parts of the catchment over the summer months while wetlands "keep wet" other parts. To demonstrate the biogeochemical implications of such spatiotemporal variations in specific discharge, we estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports with available data for the May 2008 and September 2008 samplings using both the spatially variable observed specific discharges and the spatially constant catchment average values. The average absolute difference in DOC export for the various subcatchments between using a variable and using a constant specific discharge was 28% for the May 2008 sampling and 20% for the September 2008 sampling.

AB We use an organic acid (cyclohexanepentanoic acid) to alter the wettability of three carbonates: Estaillades, Ketton and Portland limestones, and observe the relationship between the initial oil saturation and the residual saturation. We take cores containing oil and a specified initial water saturation and water-flood until 10 pore volumes have been injected. We record the remaining oil saturation as a function of the amount of water injected. In the water-wet case, with no wettability alteration, we observe, as expected, a monotonic increase in the remaining oil saturation with initial saturation. However, when the wettability is altered, we observe an increase, then a decrease, and finally an increase in the trapping curve for Estaillades limestone with a small, but continued, decrease in the remaining saturation as more water is injected. This behavior is indicative of mixed-wet or intermediate-wet conditions, as there is no spontaneous imbibition of oil and water. In contrast, Ketton did not show indications of a significant wettability alteration with a similar observed trapping profile to that observed in the water-wet case. Portland limestone also showed a monotonic increasing trend in remaining saturation with initial saturation but with a higher recovery, and less trapping, than the water-wet case. Again, this is intermediate-wet behavior with no spontaneous imbibition of either oil or water, and slow production of oil after water breakthrough. Finally, we repeat the same experiments but instead we age the three carbonates with a high asphaltenic content and high viscosity crude oil at 70 degrees C mimicking reservoir conditions. The results show a monotonic increase in residual saturation as a function of initial saturation but with higher recovery than the water-wet cases for Estaillades and Portland, with again no indication of wettability alteration for Ketton. We discuss the results in terms of pore-scale recovery process and contact angle hysteresis. In these experiments, water-saturated micro-porosity appears to protect the solid surfaces from a strong wettability alteration, particularly in Ketton. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Granular landslides impacting reservoirs may generate large waves and cause active sediment transport, and an increased understanding of these processes is important for public safety and effective reservoir management. This study investigates the waves and sediment transport caused by landslides impacting reservoirs using a two-dimensional coupled double-layer-averaged shallow water hydro-sediment-morphodynamic model. In contrast to existing models, which cannot fully account for sediment transport, the model makes a physical step forward. The model is benchmarked against laboratory experiments of landslide-generated waves in both two and three dimensions. Based on extended numerical cases, the capability of the model is further demonstrated by comparisons with empirical relationships of waves in 2-D. In addition, sediment transport is resolved in terms of the sediment concentration and bed deformation. The results show that the wave types and amplitudes in 2-D are dictated by the sediment transport speed, which also governs the landslide-to-wave momentum transfer and the landslide efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the horizontal runout distance to the vertical fall height. With increasing sediment transport speed, landslide-generated waves in 2-D vary gradually from smaller nonlinear oscillatory waves to larger waves with solitary-like wave characteristics, including nonlinear transition waves, solitary waves, and dissipative transient bores. In contrast to the momentum transfer ratio, the landslide efficiency increases with the sediment transport speed and decreases with the reservoir water depth and the lateral spreading in 3-D cases.
   Plain Language Summary The waves and sediment transport due to granular landslides impacting reservoirs are numerically solved by a double-layer-averaged shallow water hydro-sediment-morphodynamic model. It is shown that wave type and amplitude in 2-D are dictated by sediment transport speed relying on initial landslide volume and velocity, slope angle, and reservoir water depth. Contrary to the landslide-to-wave momentum transfer ratio, landslide efficiency increases with initial landslide volume and velocity as well as slope angle and is constrained by reservoir water depth and lateral spreading in 3-D.

AB In this research, a light transmission visualization (LTV) method was used to quantify dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPL) saturation in two-dimensional (2-D), two fluid phase systems. The method is an expansion of earlier LTV methods and takes into account both absorption and refraction light theories. Based on this method, DNAPL and water saturations can rapidly be obtained point wise across sand-packed 2-D flow chambers without the need to develop a calibration curve. A single point calibration step is, however, needed when dyed DNAPL is used to account for the change in the transmission factor at the dyed DNAPL-water interface. The method was applied to measure, for the first time, undyed DNAPL saturation in small 2-D chambers. Known amounts of DNAPL, modeled by tetrachloroethylene (PCE), were added to the chamber and these amounts were compared to results obtained by this LTV method. Strong correlation existed between results obtained based on this method and the known PCE amounts with an R-2 value of 0.993. Similar experiments conducted using dyed PCE showed a stronger correlation between results obtained by this LTV method and the known amounts of dyed PCE added to the chamber with an R-2 value of 0.999. The method was also used to measure dyed PCE saturation in a large 2-D model following sparging experiments. Results obtained from image analyses following each sparging event were compared to results obtained by two independent techniques, namely gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses and carbon column extraction. There was a good agreement between the results obtained by this LTV method and those obtained by the two independent techniques when experiments were carried out under stable light source conditions and errors in mass balance were minor. The method presented here can be expanded to measure fluid contents in three fluid phase systems and provide a non-destructive, non-intrusive tool to investigate changes in DNAPL architecture and flow characteristics in laboratory experiments.

AB Lake Hulun is the fifth-largest lake in China, playing a substantial role in maintaining the balance of the grassland ecosystem of the Mongolia Plateau, which is a crucial ecological barrier in North China. To better understand the changing characteristics of Lake Hulun and the driving mechanisms, it is necessary to investigate the water storage changes of Lake Hulun on extended timescales. The main objective of this study is to reconstruct the water storage time series of Lake Hulun over the past century. We employed a machine learning approach termed the extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) to reconstruct the water storage changes over a one-century timescale based on the generated bathymetry and satellite altimetry data and investigated the relationships with hydrological and climatic variables in long term. Results show that the water storage changes from 1961 to 2019 were featured by four fluctuation phases, with the highest water storage observed in 1991 (14.02 Gt) and the lowest point in 2012 (5.18 Gt). The century-scale reconstruction result reveals that the water storage of Lake Hulun reached the highest point in the 1960s within the period of 1910-2019. The lowest stage occurred in the sub-period of the 1930s-1940s, which was even lower than the alerted shrinkage stage in 2012. The predictive model results indicate the effective performance of the XGBoost model in reconstructing century-scale water storage variations, with the mean absolute error of 0.68, normalized root mean square error of 0.11, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.97, and correlation coefficient of 0.94. The annual fluctuations of water storage were mostly affected by precipitation, followed by vapor pressure, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and wet day frequency. The dominating characteristics of different variables vary evidently with different sub-periods. The atmospheric circulations of the Arctic Oscillation, El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation have tight associations with the water storage variations of Lake Hulun, which change with different study periods.

AB Flow in fractured porous media is crucial for production of oil/gas reservoirs and exploitation of geothermal energy. Flow behaviors in such media are mainly dictated by the distribution of fractures. Measuring and inferring the distribution of fractures is subject to large uncertainty, which, in turn, leads to great uncertainty in the prediction of flow behaviors. Inverse modeling with dynamic data may assist to constrain fracture distributions, thus reducing the uncertainty of flow prediction. However, inverse modeling for flow in fractured reservoirs is challenging, owing to the discrete and non-Gaussian distribution of fractures, as well as strong nonlinearity in the relationship between flow responses and model parameters. In this work, building upon a series of recent advances, an inverse modeling approach is proposed to efficiently update the flow model to match the dynamic data while retaining geological realism in the distribution of fractures. In the approach, the Hough-transform method is employed to parameterize non-Gaussian fracture fields with continuous parameter fields, thus rendering desirable properties required by many inverse modeling methods. In addition, a recently developed forward simulation method, the embedded discrete fracture method (EDFM), is utilized to model the fractures. The EDFM maintains computational efficiency while preserving the ability to capture the geometrical details of fractures because the matrix is discretized as structured grid, while the fractures being handled as planes are inserted into the matrix grids. The combination of Hough representation of fractures with the EDFM makes it possible to tune the fractures (through updating their existence, location, orientation, length, and other properties) without requiring either unstructured grids or regridding during updating. Such a treatment is amenable to numerous inverse modeling approaches, such as the iterative inverse modeling method employed in this study, which is capable of dealing with strongly nonlinear problems. A series of numerical case studies with increasing complexity are set up to examine the performance of the proposed approach.

AB Detailed channel and water surface surveys were conducted on 15 mountain stream reaches (9 step-pool, 5 cascade, and 1 plane-bed) using a tripod-mounted Light Detection and Ranging scanner and laser theodolite. Reach-average velocities were measured at varying discharges with dye tracers and fluorometers. Multiple regressions and analysis of variance tests were used to test hypothesized correlations between Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient, f, and potential control variables. Gradient (S-0) and relative grain submergence (R-h/D-84) individually explained a low proportion of the variability in f (R-2 = 0.18), where R-h is hydraulic radius, D-84 is the 84th percentile of the cumulative grain size distribution, and R-2 is equal to the coefficient of determination. Because channel type, grain size, and S-0 are interrelated, we tested the hypothesis that f is highly correlated with all three of these variables or a combination of the above variables with flow period (a categorical variable) or dimensionless unit discharge (q*). Total resistance correlated strongly (adj-R-2 = 0.74, 0.69, and 0.64) with S-0, flow period, wood load (volume of wood/m(2) of channel), q*, and channel type (step-pool, cascade, plane-bed). Total resistance differed between step-pool and plane-bed and between cascade and plane-bed reaches. Significant differences in f in step-pool and cascade reaches were found at the same values of flow and S-0. The regression analyses indicate that discharge explains the most variability in f, followed by S-0 when discharge is similar among channel reaches, but that R-h/D-84 is not an appropriate variable in these steep mountain streams to represent variations in both resistance and discharge. Results also indicate that the forms of resistance among channel types are sufficiently different to change the relationship of the control variables with f in each channel type. These results can be used to further the development of predictive equations for high-gradient mountain streams.

AB [ 1] Hyporheic exchange is generally analyzed with the assumption of a homogeneous hyporheic zone. In reality, streambed sediments have a heterogeneous structure, and this natural heterogeneity produces spatially variable interfacial fluxes and complex hyporheic exchange patterns. To assess the basic effects of sediment structure on hyporheic exchange, we performed salt and dye injection experiments in a recirculating laboratory flume with two heterogeneous sediment beds characterized by negative-exponential correlated random hydraulic conductivity fields. Dye injections showed that the hyporheic flow structure was controlled by the spatial relationship of bed forms to high-and low-permeability regions of the streambed. As no existing model could represent these effects, we developed a new finite element model to calculate the pore water flow field resulting from the interaction of the bed form-induced boundary head distribution and the heterogeneous sediment structure. A numerical particle-tracking approach was then used to assess the resulting hyporheic exchange. The combined flow-transport model did an excellent job of predicting the complex hyporheic flow pathways in the heterogeneous bed and the net hyporheic exchange up to t approximate to 30 hours. The heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field caused both greater spatial variability in the water flux through the bed surface and a greater average interfacial flux than would have occurred with a homogeneous bed. The layered correlation structure of the streambed produced an effective anisotropy that favored longitudinal pore water flow and caused a relatively rapid decrease of the mean pore water velocity with depth. As a result, solute penetration into the bed was confined to a more shallow region than would have occurred with a homogeneous bed. The combination of faster near-surface transport and shallower solute penetration produced a shorter mean hyporheic residence time. On the basis of the combination of experimental results and model simulations we conclude that the structural heterogeneity of streambed sediments produces more spatially limited hyporheic exchange that occurs with greater spatial variability and at a higher overall rate.

AB Desertification is a change in soil properties, vegetation or climate, which results in a persistent loss of ecosystem services that are fundamental to sustaining life. Desertification affects large dryland areas around the world and is a major cause of stress in human societies. Here we review recent research on the drivers, feedbacks, and impacts of desertification. A multidisciplinary approach to understanding the drivers and feedbacks of global desertification is motivated by our increasing need to improve global food production and to sustainably manage ecosystems in the context of climate change. Classic desertification theories look at this process as a transition between stable states in bistable ecosystem dynamics. Climate change (i.e., aridification) and land use dynamics are the major drivers of an ecosystem shift to a "desertified" (or "degraded") state. This shift is typically sustained by positive feedbacks, which stabilize the system in the new state. Desertification feedbacks may involve land degradation processes (e. g., nutrient loss or salinization), changes in rainfall regime resulting from land-atmosphere interactions (e. g., precipitation recycling, dust emissions), or changes in plant community composition (e. g., shrub encroachment, decrease in vegetation cover). We analyze each of these feedback mechanisms and discuss their possible enhancement by interactions with socio-economic drivers. Large scale effects of desertification include the emigration of "environmental refugees" displaced from degraded areas, climatic changes, and the alteration of global biogeochemical cycles resulting from the emission and long-range transport of fine mineral dust. Recent research has identified some possible early warning signs of desertification, which can be used as indicators of resilience loss and imminent shift to desert-like conditions. We conclude with a brief discussion on some desertification control strategies implemented in different regions around the world. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the transport of chemicals in a turbulent stream when both sorbing suspended load and decay reactions are present. These conditions, which can be found quite commonly in rivers, give rise to interesting behaviour. Important and not trivial processes are added and interact with the classical diffusive, advective, and dispersive mechanisms. Due to the sorption process, the chemical divides into an aqueous and a sorbed phase which follow different evolutions: the aqueous phase is regulated by turbulent diffusion, advection and shear, while the sorbed one undergoes the same fluid dynamic mechanisms but through the evolution of suspended sediment, which is also subjected to sedimentation. The evolutions of the two phases are not separate, as the sorption-desorption exchanges between the aqueous and sorbed phases connect their dynamics. In turn, the decay reactions, being able to modify the concentrations in the two phases, influence the sorption process and therefore the entire transport dynamics. A complex picture results where several nonlinear interactions occur.
   The main objective of the work is to obtain the one-dimensional partial differential equation that describes the temporal and spatial dynamics of the depth-averaged concentration of the chemical. Due to the existence of three well separated time scales in the whole transport process, the mathematical homogenization theory is adopted to average the two-dimensional model, and the most general case is dealt with in which sediment transport is unsteady while the reactions are nonlinear and different for the aqueous and sorbed phases. Finally, some examples of real cases are discussed where the influence of unsteady suspended sediment dynamics and the nonlinearity of reactions is analyzed, while the role of the several nonlinear differential terms in the model is highlighted.

AB Derivation of macroscopic models for advection-diffusion processes in the presence of dominant heterogeneous (e.g., surface) reactions using homogenisation theory or volume averaging is often deemed unfeasible (Valdes-Parada a al., 2011; Battiato and Tartakovsky, 2011a) due to the strong coupling between scales that characterise such systems. In this work, we show how the upscaling can be carried out by applying and extending the methods presented in Allaire and Raphael (2007), Mauri (1991). The approach relies on the decomposition of the microscale concentration into a reactive component, given by the eigenfunction of the advection-diffusion operator, the associated eigenvalue which represents the macroscopic effective reaction rate, and a non-reactive component. The latter can be then upscaled with a two-scale asymptotic expansion and the final macroscopic equation is obtained for the leading order. The same method can also be used to overcome another classical assumption, namely of non solenoidal velocity fields, such as the case of deposition of charged colloidal particles driven by electrostatic potential forces. The whole upscaling procedure, which consists in solving three cell problems, is implemented for arbitrarily complex two- and three-dimensional periodic structures using the open-source finite volume library OpenFOAM (R). We provide details on the implementation and test the methodology for two-dimensional periodic arrays of spheres, and we compare the results against fully resolved numerical simulations, demonstrating the accuracy and generally of the upscaling approach. The effective velocity, dispersion and reaction coefficients are obtained for a wide range of Peclet and surface Damkohler numbers, and for Coulomb-like forces to the grains. Noticeably, all the effective transport parameters are significantly different from the non-reactive (conserved scalar) case, as the heterogeneity introduced by the reaction strongly affects the micro-scale profiles.

AB Understanding and predicting colloid transport and retention in water-saturated porous media is important for the protection of human and ecological health. Early applications of colloid transport research before the 1990s included the removal of pathogens in granular drinking water filters. Since then, interest has expanded significantly to include such areas as source zone protection of drinking water systems and injection of nanometals for contaminated site remediation. This review summarizes predictive tools for colloid transport from the pore to field scales. First, we review experimental breakthrough and retention of colloids under favorable and unfavorable colloid/collector interactions (i.e., no significant and significant colloid-surface repulsion, respectively). Second, we review the continuum-scale modeling strategies used to describe observed transport behavior. Third, we review the following two components of colloid filtration theory: (i) mechanistic force/torque balance models of pore-scale colloid trajectories and (ii) approximating correlation equations used to predict colloid retention. The successes and limitations of these approaches for favorable conditions are summarized, as are recent developments to predict colloid retention under the unfavorable conditions particularly relevant to environmental applications. Fourth, we summarize the influences of physical and chemical heterogeneities on colloid transport and avenues for their prediction. Fifth, we review the upscaling of mechanistic model results to rate constants for use in continuum models of colloid behavior at the column and field scales. Overall, this paper clarifies the foundation for existing knowledge of colloid transport and retention, features recent advances in the field, critically assesses where existing approaches are successful and the limits of their application, and highlights outstanding challenges and future research opportunities. These challenges and opportunities include improving mechanistic descriptions, and subsequent correlation equations, for nanoparticle (i.e., Brownian particle) transport through soil, developing mechanistic descriptions of colloid retention in so-called unfavorable conditions via methods such as the discrete heterogeneity approach, and employing imaging techniques such as X-ray tomography to develop realistic expressions for grain topology and mineral distribution that can aid the development of these mechanistic approaches.

AB Net accumulation measurements from two glaciers located on opposite sides of the New Zealand Southern Alps were used to explore processes controlling spatial variability. The degree of variability, as measured by the spatial variogram, differed in each of the three successive years, but the lowest variance occurred on both glaciers in March 2008, after a hot and dry summer. Strong relationships between net accumulation and elevation within the accumulation area were only found on Franz Josef Glacier (FJG), despite this being the primary control used in glacier mass balance modelling. Interaction between wind and topography was found to be important to the distribution of net accumulation on both glaciers. The crevasse stratigraphy method is an ideal way to gain good spatial coverage of net accumulation, and particularly suited to glaciers with high annual precipitation.

AB We measured the fluxes of sensible and latent heat between a low-land dipterocarp forest in Peninsular Malaysia and the atmosphere. No clear seasonal or interannual changes in latent heat flux were found from 2003 to 2005, while sensible heat flux sometimes fluctuated depending on the fluctuation of incoming radiation between wet and dry seasons. The evapotranspiration rates averaged for the period between 2003 and 2005 were 2.77 and 3.61 mm day(-1) using eddy covariance data without and with an energy balance correction, respectively. Average precipitation was 4.74 mm day(-1). Midday surface conductance decreased with an increasing atmospheric water vapour pressure deficit and thus restricted the excess water loss on sunny days in the dry season. However, the relationship between the surface conductance and vapour pressure deficit did not significantly decline with an increase in volumetric soil water content even during a period of extremely low rainfall.

AB Quantifying and partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) into evaporation and transpiration is challenging but important for interpreting vegetation effects on the water balance. We applied a model based on the theory of maximum entropy production to estimate ET for shrubs for the first time in a low-energy humid headwater catchment in the Scottish Highlands. In total, 53% of rainfall over the growing season was returned to the atmosphere through ET (59 +/- 2% as transpiration), with 22% of rainfall ascribed to interception loss and understory ET. The remainder of rainfall percolated below the rooting zone. The maximum entropy production model showed good capability for total ET estimation, in addition to providing a first approximation for distinguishing evaporation and transpiration in such ecosystems. This study shows that this simple and low-cost approach has potential for local to regional ET estimation with availability of high-resolution hydroclimatic data. Limitations of the approach are also discussed.

AB A series of slug tests with various initial head displacements was carried out to investigate the influence of nonlinear groundwater flow on a slug test in fractured rock. To identify the nonlinear flow regime during a slug test, a representative Reynolds number (Re) was calculated using the slug test results and the fractures identified from geophysical logging and core logs. The Forchheimer equation and cubic law were used to determine the critical Re where nonlinear flow arose in the test zone. Our results showed that nonlinear flow arose when the initial displacement was over 1.0 m. Then, the degree of nonlinearity increased and the estimated hydraulic conductivity from the test results decreased with increasing initial displacement. The study also suggested that the Forchheimer and cubic law can be used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity in a linear flow regime using data from the slug tests in a nonlinear flow regime.

AB Changes in groundwater elevation may cause a change in the net normal stress and matric potential within the soil mass, which results in volume changes of unsaturated soil. This research investigated the relationship between the drawdown of groundwater and the characteristics of volumetric compressibility of unsaturated soil. Sand column experiments were designed and conducted to measure the volume changes of coarse and fine sands under different types of drainage conditions at fast and slow drainage rates. The finite element program FEMWATER was calibrated and used to simulate the distributions of stress, tension and moisture content within the sands. Finally, based on the changes of net normal stress and matric potential and the observed volume change of the sands, a least-square method was applied to determine the volumetric consolidation parameters of the unsaturated soils.

AB We compared three groups of models commonly used to describe the dependence of relative nonwetting-phase permeability on phase saturation in porous media and tested the capability of these models to predict relative air permeabilities using two experimental data sets. The first group of models is purely empirical, involving no fitting parameters. In models of the second type, denoted here as geometry-based models, relative nonwetting-phase permeability is derived from the wetting-phase retention curve on the basis of an idealized concept of pore space geometry. According to these models, nonwetting-phase permeability should vary over the full range of saturation and should be a function of total nonwetting-phase saturation. In models of the third type this variation is limited to a narrower range based on the concept that only part of the nonwetting phase contributes to permeability and assuming that the relationship between the "effective" saturation of this continuous nonwetting phase can be described by the same mathematical functions as between total nonwetting-phase saturation and relative permeability in the geometry-based models. Since this implies some kind of analogy, we refer to this group of models as "analogy-based." We found that matching the saturation at which nonwetting-phase permeability emerges, i.e., the emergence point, is crucial for the description or prediction of relative nonwetting-phase permeability in the range of high wetting-phase saturations. Using analogy-based models which were derived from the geometry-based models by simply rescaling the effective saturation range to fit this endpoint, predictions were found to depend sensitively on whether the Burdine or the Mualem model was chosen to relate the permeability function to the retention curve. Differences between these two approaches were found to be primarily due to the different exponents in the tortuosity term. When we made this parameter flexible and determined it by curve-fitting from measured data, we obtained very good fits of experimental air permeabilities.

TI Characterisation of compound dry and hot events in Inner Mongolia and

AB In recent decades, frequent compound dry and hot events (CDHEs) have posed a great threat to humans and the ecological environment, especially in Inner Mongolia, which has typical arid and semi-arid characteristics. Therefore, while exploring the characteristics of the spatial and temporal evolution of the CDHEs in Inner Mongolia, and elucidating their teleconnections with large-scale circulation indexes, it can not only provide useful enlightenment for ecological protection, but also provide more detailed information for understanding the corresponding details of CDHEs with large-scale circulation indexes. In this study, monthly temperature and precipitation data from 115 meteorological stations in Inner Mongolia for each summer from 1981 to 2020 were used to establish a standardised dry and hot index (SDHI), characterising the severity of extreme compound events of drought and high temperature in Inner Mongolia. This data was also used to analyse the spatial and temporal characteristics of such compound events over the past 40 years. Thereafter, Pearson's correlation, stepwise multiple regression models, and multivariate wavelet analysis methods were used to assess the relationship between the atmospheric circulation index and SDHI in terms of linear, non-linear, and different combinations of the four large-scale circulation indexes. The results show that SDHI performs well in the assessment of CDHEs in Inner Mongolia and shows great similarities with historical records. The overall trend of CDHEs in Inner Mongolia over the past 40 years has intensified over time. Spatially, abnormal and moderate dry and hot events mainly occurred in Inner Mongolia before the 21st century, and the frequency of occurrence was higher in the eastern region than in the western region. Furthermore, the severity of CDHEs has increased significantly since the 21st century, with severe and extreme dry and hot events occurring more frequently in the western region than in the eastern region. The results of the correlation analysis show that, among the four large-scale circulation indexes, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has the greatest influence on the CDHEs in Inner Mongolia when it is positive, with the highest significance, and when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) show negative phases, they are more likely to cause dry and hot events in Inner Mongolia. Further, where the number of stations negatively influenced by NAO is higher, the effect of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on dry and hot events is usually insignificant. Partial wavelet coherence (PWC) analysis suggests that the independent effects of circulation factors may be weaker but appear to be stronger due to their interdependence with other circulation patterns. Finally, the multiple wavelet coherence (MWC) results show that the changes in SDHI values can be best explained by a combination of two or more factors.

ID INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT; NETHERLANDS; COEVOLUTION; TRANSITION
AB Investments in the physical infrastructure, human capital, and institutions needed for water resources management have been noteworthy in the development of most civilizations. These investments affect the economy in two distinct ways: (i) by improving the factor productivity of water in multiple economic sectors, especially those that are water intensive such as agriculture and energy and (ii) by reducing acute and chronic harmful effects of water-related hazards like floods, droughts, and water-related diseases. The need for capital investment to mitigate risks and promote economic growth is widely acknowledged, but prior conceptual work on the relationship between water-related investments and economic growth has focused on the productive and harmful roles of water in the economy independently. Here the two influences are combined using a simple, dynamical systems model of water-related investment, risk, and growth. In cases where initial water security is low, initial investment in water-related assets enables growth. Without such investment, losses due to water-related hazards exert a drag on economic growth and may create a poverty trap. The presence and location of the poverty trap is context-specific and depends on the exposure of productive water-related assets to water-related risk. Exogenous changes in water-related risk can potentially push an economy away from a growth path toward a poverty trap. Our investigation shows that an inverted-U-shaped investment relation between the level of investment in water security and the current level of water security leads to faster rates of growth than the alternatives that we consider here, and that this relation is responsible for the "S"-curve that is posited in the literature. These results illustrate the importance of accounting for environmental and health risks in economic models and offer insights for the design of robust policies for investment in water-related productive assets to manage risk, in the face of environmental change.

   Uncertainties associated with the use of stage-discharge rating curves
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Hydrometry; Uncertainties; Rating curves; Stage-discharge relationship
ID RIVER DISCHARGE
AB The vast majority of hydrological stations are set up such that discharge can be estimated from the sole measurement of water height or stage above a local datum. Hydraulics laws show that in the right conditions there may be a unique and stable relationship between stage and discharge, which can be described by a rating curve. For short-term projects where there may be little choice for station location and time to construct a detailed rating curve, conditions for the use of rating curves may be less than ideal, potentially yielding high uncertainties on hydrologic measurements. This article evaluates uncertainties induced on instantaneous flow rates and cumulative annual flow volumes by the use of one-segmented rating curves in small streams. Uncertainty distributions were obtained by simulating rating curves calculated from random sampling of reference flow and stage data obtained with Doppler flowmeters. Factors tested included the number of manual gauged points, the type of rating curve (power vs polynomial), the use or not of the observed stage-of-zero flow, the spread of gauged points along flow range, and the measurement errors during gauging. Results could vary widely depending on the scenarios tested and sometimes yielded very high uncertainties. The best scenario yielded significant uncertainties on annual cumulative flow volume included between -13% and +14% for the low gradient streams and between -5% and +7% for the higher gradient streams, and for 22 manual gauged points per year. Our results show that, even in the best scenario, very significant uncertainty can result from using one-segmented rating curve in non-ideal situations in the field. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Isometric log ratios of proportions of major ions, derived from intuitive sequential binary partitions, are used to characterize hydrochemical variability within and between coal seam gas (CSG) and surrounding aquifers in a number of sedimentary basins in the USA and Australia. These isometric log ratios are the coordinates corresponding to an orthonormal basis in the sample space (the simplex). The characteristic proportions of ions, as described by linear models of isometric log ratios, can be used for a mathematical-descriptive classification of water types. This is a more informative and robust method of describing water types than simply classifying a water type based on the dominant ions. The approach allows (a) compositional distinctions between very similar water types to be made and (b) large data sets with a high degree of variability to be rapidly assessed with respect to particular relationships/compositions that are of interest. A major advantage of these techniques is that major and minor ion components can be comprehensively assessed and subtle processeswhich may be masked by conventional techniques such as Stiff diagrams, Piper plots, and classic ion ratioscan be highlighted. Results show that while all CSG groundwaters are dominated by Na, HCO3, and Cl ions, the proportions of other ions indicate they can evolve via different means and the particular proportions of ions within total or subcompositions can be unique to particular basins. Using isometric log ratios, subtle differences in the behavior of Na, K, and Cl between CSG water types and very similar Na-HCO3 water types in adjacent aquifers are also described. A complementary pair of isometric log ratios, derived from a geochemically-intuitive sequential binary partition that is designed to reflect compositional variability within and between CSG groundwater, is proposed. These isometric log ratios can be used to model a hydrochemical pathway associated with methanogenesis and/or to delineate groundwater associated with high gas concentrations.

AB [1] A multiphase flow-aqueous phase transport numerical model (DNAPL3D-MT) is developed to simulate the dissolution of complex source zones containing both pooled and residual dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). The multiphase flow model (DNAPL3D) is coupled to the aqueous species transport code (MT3D) via a flexible mass transfer function, which can employ the local equilibrium assumption or the single boundary layer expression for rate-limited dissolution either incorporating a lumped (correlation function) coefficient or explicitly accounting for the interfacial area (IFA) between the fluids. For the latter, this work employs the thermodynamically based Explicit IFA Submodel (Grant and Gerhard, 2007), which provides IFA as a function of saturation and saturation history. A bench-scale experiment is presented involving the complete, natural dissolution of a DNAPL source zone emplaced by a point source release into heterogeneous porous media. DNAPL3D-MT simulations of the experiment, involving no calibration to results, are compared with the observed evolution of both (1) measured downgradient dissolved phase concentrations and (2) DNAPL source zone configuration. The model, employing a mass transfer expression equipped with the Explicit IFA Submodel, simulates the experiment more accurately than when equipped with either a local equilibrium assumption or a published empirical correlation expression. Sensitivity simulations indicate that this model validation is sensitive to a number of the key assumptions in the Submodel derivation except one: the relationship between interfacial area and residual DNAPL saturations. The employed assumption of a single mass transfer coefficient value is supported by an analysis of the evolution of Peclet numbers throughout the DNAPL source zone, which reveals that the low hydraulic gradient employed resulted in diffusion-dominated mass transfer conditions throughout the experiment. This study suggests that simulations of global mass flux from complex DNAPL source zones are sensitive to the interrelationship of rate-limited mass transfer and groundwater velocity (and thus aqueous phase relative permeability and DNAPL saturation) at the local scale.

AB Hillslope runoff theory is based largely on the differentiation between infiltration excess overland flow, saturation excess overland flow, and subsurface stormflow. Here we explore to what extent a 2-D friction-based overland flow model is useful for predicting hillslope-scale subsurface stormflow, posited here as phenomenologically the same as infiltration excess at depth. We compare our results to a 3-D variably saturated Darcy-Richards subsurface solver for individual rainfall runoff events. We use field data from the well-studied Panola Mountain Experimental hillslope in Georgia USA. Our results show that the two models are largely indistinguishable in terms of their ability to simulate the hillslope hydrograph magnitude and timing for a range of slopes and rainfall depths. Furthermore, we find that the descriptive ability of the overland flow model is comparable to the variably saturated subsurface flow model in terms of its ability to represent the spatial distribution of subsurface stormflow and infiltration across the soil-bedrock interface. More importantly, these results imply that the physics of infiltration excess subsurface stormflow at the soil-bedrock interface is similar to infiltration excess overland flow at the soil surface, in terms of detention storage, loss along the lower boundary, and threshold-like activation at the larger hillslope scale. Given the phenomenological similarity of overland flow and subsurface stormflow and the fact that overland flow model predictions are considerably faster to run (particularly as slope and rainfall depth increase), these findings imply that new forms of hillslope-scale subsurface storm runoff predictions may be possible with the knowledge of bedrock permeability and limited soil information. Finally, this work suggests that the role of soil mantle vis-a-vis subsurface stormflow is mainly as a filter that delays the development of patches of saturation along the bedrock surface. Our model results show that simple realizations of soil based on a few soil depth measurements can possibly be enough to characterize this filtering effect.

AB [1] The use of uncertainty analysis is gaining considerable attention in catchment hydrological modeling. In particular, the choice of appropriate model structure, identifiability of parameter values, and the reduction of model predictive uncertainty are deemed as essential elements of hydrological modeling. The chosen model structure must be parsimonious, and the parameters used must either be derivable from field-measured data or inferred unambiguously from analysis of catchment response data. In this paper, a long-term water balance model for the Susannah Brook catchment in Western Australia has been pursued using the "downward approach,'' which is a systematic approach to determine the model with the minimum level of complexity, with parameter values that, in theory, are derivable from existing physiographic data relating to the catchment. Through analysis of rainfall-runoff response at three different timescales and exploring the climate, soil, and vegetation controls on the water balance response at these timescales, an initial model structure was formulated, and a priori model parameter values were estimated. Further investigation with the use of auxiliary data such as deuterium concentration in the streamflow exposed inadequacies in the chosen model structure. Two more model structures were then proposed and investigated through formulating alternative hypotheses regarding the underlying causes of observed variability, including those suggested by observed deuterium composition in the streamflows and observed groundwater level dynamics. Along the way, the resulting models were systematically evaluated in three dimensions: ability to reproduce observations, predictive uncertainty, and physical realism. The final model, which included an efficient but detailed representation of unsaturated zone time delay, was found to be superior on all three counts, i.e., improved performance, reduced predictive uncertainty, and improved physical realism. These improvements can be directly attributed to the use of the auxiliary data ( deuterium composition and groundwater level dynamics), which identified weaknesses in previous model structures, and the multiple wetting front model of water movement in the unsaturated zone, which captured more effectively the time delay in the unsaturated zone.

AB Riparian vegetation is affected by both flood processes and the characteristics of landforms that are shaped by floods. In many instances, species occurrence can be linked directly to specific fluvial landforms. These spatial relationships are largely due to the role of floods in the differential destruction of vegetation, in the determination of substrate characteristics, and in the transport of propagules. Major floods may, depending on the climatic context, allow for the establishment of stands of vegetation, or restart processes of plant community change. Disturbance by floods can also affect biodiversity: species richness in some watersheds is greatest where steep valley floor gradients allow for high-energy floods.
   The recognition and analysis of hydrogeomorphological influences on riparian vegetation are complicated by multiple scales of environmental interactions, by the covariance of some environmental variables, and by feedbacks between vegetation and flood regimes.

AB We investigate the temporal behavior of transport coefficients in a model for transport of a solute through a spatially heterogeneous saturated aquifer. In the framework of a stochastic approach we derive explicit expressions for the temporal behavior of the center-of-mass velocity and the dispersion of the concentration distribution after a point-like injection of solute at time t = 0, using a second-order perturbation expansion. The model takes into account local variations in the hydraulic conductivity (which, in turn, induce local fluctuations in the groundwater flow velocities) and in the chemical adsorption properties of the medium (which lead to a spatially varying local retardation factor). In the given perturbation theory approach the various heterogeneity-induced contributions can be systematically traced back to fluctuations in these quantities and to cross correlations between them. We analyze two conceptually different definitions for the resulting dispersion coefficient: the "effective" dispersion coefficient which is derived from the average over the centered second moments of the spatial concentration distributions in every realization and the "ensemble" dispersion coefficient which follows from the second moment of the ensemble-averaged concentration distribution. The first quantity characterizes the dispersion in a typical realization of the medium, whereas the second one describes the (formal) dispersion properties of the ensemble as a whole. We give explicit analytic expressions for both quantities as functions of time and show that for finite times their temporal behavior is remarkably different. The ensemble dispersion coefficient which is usually evaluated in the literature considerably overestimates the dispersion typically found in one given realization of the medium. From our explicit results we identify two relevant timescales separating regimes of qualitatively and quantitatively different temporal behavior: The shorter of the two scales is set by the advective transport of the solute cloud over one disorder correlation length, whereas the second, much larger one, is related to the dispersive spreading over the same distance. Only for times much larger than this second scale, do the effective and the ensemble dispersion coefficient become equivalent because of mixing caused by the local transversal dispersion. The formulae are applied to the Borden experiment data. It is concluded that the observed dispersion coefficient matches the effective dispersion coefficient at finite times proposed in this paper very well.

AB In single-event deterministic design flood estimation methods, estimates of the peak discharge are based on a single and representative catchment response time parameter. In small catchments, a simplified convolution process between a single-observed hyetograph and hydrograph is generally used to estimate time parameters such as the time to peak (T-P), time of concentration (T-C), and lag time (T-L) to reflect the "observed" catchment response time. However, such simplification is neither practical nor applicable in medium to large heterogeneous catchments, where antecedent moisture from previous rainfall events and spatially non-uniform rainfall hyetographs can result in multi-peaked hydrographs. In addition, the paucity of rainfall data at sub-daily timescales further limits the reliable estimation of catchment responses using observed hyetographs and hydrographs at these catchment scales. This paper presents the development of a new and consistent approach to estimate catchment response times, expressed as the time to peak (T-Px) obtained directly from observed streamflow data. The relationships between catchment response time parameters and conceptualised triangular-shaped hydrograph approximations and linear catchment response functions are investigated in four climatologically regions of South Africa. Flood event characteristics using primary streamflow data from 74 flow-gauging stations were extracted and analysed to derive unique relationships between peak discharge, baseflow, direct runoff, and catchment response time in terms of T-Px. The T-Px parameters are estimated from observed streamflow data using three different methods: (a) duration of total net rise of a multipeaked hydrograph, (b) triangular-shaped direct runoff hydrograph approximations, and (c) linear catchment response functions. The results show that for design hydrology and for the derivation of empirical equations to estimate catchment response times in ungauged catchments, the catchment T-Px should be estimated from both the use of an average catchment T-Px value computed using either Methods (a) or (b) and a linear catchment response function as used in Method (c). The use of the different methods in combination is not only practical but is also objective and has consistent results.

AB Short-lived fallout isotopes, such as beryllium-7 (Be-7), are increasingly used as erosion and sediment tracers in watersheds. Be-7 is produced in the atmosphere and delivered to the Earth's surface primarily in precipitation. However, relatively little has been published about the variation in Be-7 wet deposition caused by storm type and vegetation cover. Our analysis of precipitation, throughfall, and sediments in two forested, headwater catchments in the mid-Atlantic USA indicates significant variation in isotope deposition with storm type and storm height. Individual summer convective thunderstorms were associated with Be-7 activity concentrations up to 5.0Bql(-1) in precipitation and 4.7Bql(-1) in throughfall, while single-event wet depositional fluxes reached 168Bqm(-2) in precipitation and 103Bqm(-2) in throughfall. Storms originating from the continental USA were associated with lower Be-7 activity concentrations and single-event wet depositional fluxes for precipitation (0.7-1.2Bql(-1) and 15.8-65.0Bqm(-2)) and throughfall (0.1-0.3Bql(-1) and 13.5-98.9Bqm(-2)). Tropical systems had relatively low activity concentrations, 0.2-0.5Bql(-1) in precipitation and 0.2-1.0Bql(-1) in throughfall, but relatively high single-event depositional fluxes due to large rainfall volumes, 32.8-67.6Bqm(-2) in precipitation and 25.7-134Bqm(-2) in throughfall. The largest sources of Be-7 depositional variation were attributed to storm characteristics including precipitation amount and maximum storm height. Be-7 activity associated with fluvial suspended sediments also exhibited the highest concentration and variability in summer (175-1450Bqkg(-1)). We conclude the dominant source of variation on event-level Be-7 deposition is storm type. Our results illustrate the complex relationships between Be-7 deposition in precipitation and throughfall and demonstrate event-scale relationships between the Be-7 in precipitation and on suspended sediment.

AB Soil moisture is highly variable both spatially and temporally. It is widely recognized that improving the knowledge and understanding of soil moisture and the processes underpinning its spatial and temporal distribution is critical. This paper addresses the relationship between near-surface and root zone soil moisture, the way in which they vary spatially and temporally, and the effect of sampling design for determining catchment scale soil moisture dynamics. In this study, catchment scale near-surface (0-50 mm) and root zone (0-300 mm) soil moisture were monitored over a four-week period. Measurements of near-surface soil moisture were recorded at various resolutions, and near-surface and root zone soil moisture data were also monitored continuously within a network of recording sensors. Catchment average near-surface soil moisture derived from detailed spatial measurements and continuous observations at fixed points were found to be significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.96; P = 0.0063; n = 4). Root zone soil moisture was also found to be highly correlated with catchment average near-surface, continuously monitored (r(2) = 0.81; p < 0.0001; n = 26) and with detailed spatial measurements of near-surface soil moisture (r(2) = 0.84). The weaker relationship observed between near-surface and root zone soil moisture is considered to be caused by the different responses to rainfall and the different factors controlling soil moisture for the soil depths of 0-50 mm and 0-300 turn. Aspect is considered to be the main factor influencing the spatial and temporal distribution of near-surface soil moisture, while topography and soil type are considered important for root zone soil moisture. The ability of a limited number of monitoring stations to provide accurate estimates of catchment scale average soil moisture for both near-surface and root zone is thus demonstrated, as opposed to high resolution spatial measurements. Similarly, the use of near-surface soil moisture measurements to obtain a reliable estimate of deeper soil moisture levels at the small catchment scale was demonstrated.

AB A Robin type boundary condition (BC), commonly adopted at stream-aquifer interface, excludes a term associated with streambed accounting for the effects of streambed storage and width. This study presents two new analytical models for describing confined flow induced by pumping in a stream-aquifer system. One model considers a single-zone aquifer and treats the streambed as a lagging Robin BC with a time lag parameter related to the effects. The other considers a two-zone aquifer consisting of aquifer and streambed zones. A Dirichlet BC for stream water level is specified at the edge of the streambed. The time-domain solutions of both models are developed to describe spatiotemporal drawdown and temporal stream filtration/depletion rate (SDR). The finite element solutions (FESs) of both models are also built. Results suggest the lag time equals the half of the squared streambed width divided by the streambed hydraulic diffusivity. The effects of streambed width and storage on SDR should be considered when their lumped parameter exceeds 0.1. Neglecting their effects causes 25% difference in SDR when the lumped parameter equals 10. Based on the FESs, the use of the lagging Robin BC takes nearly a tenth of computing time of obtaining accurate steady-state SDR for the simulation of the two-zone aquifer. In addition, the present solutions agree to a field SDR experiment conducted by Hunt et al. (2001, ). To conclude, this study presents two new models for describing groundwater flow in a stream-aquifer system and explores the joint effect of streambed width and storage on SDR.
   Key Points
   Two new analytical solutions are developed to estimate aquifer drawdown and stream depletion rate in a pumped stream-aquifer system One treats streambed as a Robin type boundary based on the lagging theory while the other considers streambed as a finite-width zone The lag time in the Robin boundary equals the half of squared streambed width divided by the streambed hydraulic diffusivity

AB This study attempts to reconcile the conflicting results reported in the literature concerning the behavior of peak-over-threshold (POT) daily rainfall extremes and their distribution. By using two worldwide data sets, the impact of threshold selection and record length on the upper tail behavior of POT observations is investigated. The rainfall process is studied within the framework of generalized Pareto (GP) exceedances according to the classical extreme value theory (EVT), with particular attention paid to the study of the GP shape parameter, which controls the heaviness of the upper tail of the GP distribution. A twofold effect is recognized. First, as the threshold decreases, and nonextreme values are progressively incorporated in the POT samples, the variance of the GP shape parameter reduces and the mean converges to positive values denoting a tendency to heavy tail behavior. Simultaneously, the EVT asymptotic hypotheses are less and less realistic, and the GP asymptote tends to be replaced by the Weibull penultimate asymptote whose upper tail is exponential but apparently heavy. Second, for a fixed high threshold, the variance of the GP shape parameter reduces as the record length (number of years) increases, and the mean values tend to be positive, thus denoting again the prevalence of heavy tail behavior. In both cases, i.e., threshold selection and record length effect, the heaviness of the tail may be ascribed to mechanisms such as the blend of extreme and nonextreme values, and fluctuations of the parent distributions. It is shown how these results provide a link between previous studies and pave the way for more comprehensive analyses which merge empirical, theoretical, and operational points of view. This study also provides several ancillary results, such as a set of formulae to correct the bias of the GP shape parameter estimates due to short record lengths accounting for uncertainty, thus avoiding systematic underestimation of extremes which results from the analysis of short time series.

AB Dynamic TOPMODEL is applied to the Maimai M8 catchment (3.8 ha), New Zealand using rainfall-runoff and water table information in model calibration. Different parametric representations of hillslope and valley bottom landscape units (LU's) were used to improve the spatial representation of the model structure. The continuous time series water table information is i obtained from tensiometric observations from both near stream (NS) and hillslope (P5) locations having different responses to rainfall events. For each location, and within an area equivalent to an effective model gridscale (25 m(2)), a number of tensiometer readings at different depths were available (11 for the NS site and nine for the P5 site). Using this information a distribution of-water table elevations for each time step at each location was calculated. The distribution of water table elevations was used to derive fuzzy estimates of the water table depth for the whole time series that includes the temporal variability of the uncertainty in the observations. These data were used to constrain the spatial representation of the model having previously conditioned the model using the rainfall-runoff data. Model conditioning was assessed using the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation procedure.
   Results show that many combinations of parameter values for the two LU's were able to simulate the rainfall-runoff data. Further constraining of the model responses using the fuzzy water table elevations at both locations considerably reduced the number of behavioural parameter sets. An evaluation of the distributions of behavioural parameter sets showed that improvements to the model structure for the two LU's were required, especially for simulations of the response at the hillslope location.

AB This paper reports oil a study analysing the spatial distribution functions, the correlation structures, and the power spectral densities of high-resolution LIDAR snow depths (similar to 1 m) in two adjacent 500 m x 500 in areas in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, one a sub-alpine forest the other in alpine tundra. It is shown how and why differences in the controlling physical processes induced by variations in vegetation cover and wind patterns lead to the observed differences in spatial organization between the snow depth fields of these environments. In the sub-alpine forest area, the mean of snow depth increases with elevation, while its standard deviation remains uniform. fit the tundra subarea. the mean of snow depth decreases with elevation, while its standard deviation varies over a wide range. The two-dimensional correlations of snow depth in the forested area indicate little spatial memory and isotropic conditions. while in the tundra they indicate a marked directional bias that is consistent with the predominant wind directions and the location of topographic ridges and depressions. The power spectral densities exhibit a power law behaviour in two frequency intervals separated by a break located at a scale of around 12 m in the forested subarea, and 65 m in the tundra subarea. The spectral exponents obtained indicate that the snow depth fields are highly variable over scales larger than the scale break, while highly correlated below. Based on the observations and oil synthetic snow depth fields generated with one- and two-dimensional spectral techniques, it is shown that the scale at which the break occurs increases with the separation distance between snow depth maxima. In addition, the breaks in the forested area coincide with those of the corresponding vegetation height field, while in the tundra subarea they are displaced towards larger scales than those observed in the corresponding vegetation height field.

AB At the local scale, artificial impounded reservoirs in dry regions exert influence on the surrounding local climate. Impounded reservoirs have been found to alter precipitation patterns and increase temperature, specific humidity and surface evaporation. The consequences of impoundment or its related climatic changes on the surrounding vegetation are still not well understood. We here examined the potential effect on surrounding tree growth of the impoundment of the Ertan Reservoir, China, in 1998. We measured Yunnan pine tree rings at three sites on a slope close to the reservoir and two control sites far away from the reservoir. We compared the annual radial growth of tree rings at all sites with air temperature, precipitation and air humidity in the region. We also used cumulative distribution functions to quantify the probability of attributing radial growth changes to background climate variability. We find an enhancement of tree growth from 2000 to 2002, right after the reservoir's impounding in experimental and control sites. Hence, the tree growth can initially be explained by favourable conditions benefiting tree growth. However, we cannot entirely attribute such enhancement to the background climate variability when studying the relationship between tree growth and climatic variables over the 36 years and their probability of occurrence. Tree growth in the three years following impoundment can only be attributed to the simultaneous effect of favourable regional climate conditions and the reservoir's impoundment in itself. These conditions decrease vegetation stress by decreasing air temperature and increasing air relative humidity. Although the findings of this study shed more light on the environmental and climatic changes induced by the impoundment of reservoirs, they also call for the need of monitoring climatic variables in the vicinity of reservoirs.

AB Intermediate-scale experiments (meter-long, two-dimensional flow cell) were performed with aerobic biodegradation of benzoate substrate in physically heterogeneous (bimodal inclusive) media. Clastic heterogeneities were represented in a quasi-two-dimensional field, with low-conductivity inclusions embedded in a high-conductivity sandy matrix. The two media had similar pore-scale dispersivities but the conductivity ratio (similar to 1:50) incurred macrodispersive spreading in the longitudinal direction. The high-conductivity sand was uniformly inoculated with Pseudomonas cepacia sp., and a pulse input of substrate and chloride ion tracer were evaluated. Degradation and growth were oxygen-limited under nonlinear dual-Monod kinetics and controlled by spatial and temporal variations in nutrient flux. The low-conductivity inclusions created regions of slow transport that prolonged the dual availability of both oxygen and substrate, which in turn enhanced microbial growth in these regions. Bacterial detachment was significant, and the fivefold increase in biomass due to growth was entirely accounted for in the aqueous effluent which displayed a complicated nonlinear breakthrough curve. High-resolution deterministic modeling was applied to simulate the intermediate-scale experiment, with parameters of the relevant constitutive relations calibrated independently through batch and small-scale column experiments. Parameter fitting to match flow cell data was avoided. This approach was taken in order both to test the predictive modeling capability as it would necessarily be used in a field application and to avoid the a priori assumption that all relevant processes were adequately represented in the respective constitutive theories. Analyses of the fit between the independently calibrated model and the flow cell data were then used to isolate processes for further experimental study. This iterative experimental/modeling approach identified processes that contributed (surprisingly) to biodegradation in heterogeneous media and yet are not currently incorporated in most mathematical models: (1) buoyancy effects associated with very small solution density variations, amplified in heterogeneous media, and (2) dynamic biological processes associated with growth, namely, endogenous respiration, cell division partitioning to the aqueous phase, and active adhesion/detachment that are strongly coupled to the transport of dissolved nutrients or microorganisms.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID FLOW; TRANSPORT; BEHAVIOR; MODELS
AB In part 1 of this paper (Ramanathan et al., 2010b) we presented a methodology and a code for modeling the hierarchical sedimentary architecture in braided channel belt deposits. Here in part 2, the code was used to create a digital model of this architecture and the corresponding spatial distribution of permeability. The simulated architecture was compared to the real stratal architecture observed in an abandoned channel belt. The comparisons included assessments of similarity which were both qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative comparisons show that the geometries of unit types within the synthetic deposits are generally consistent with field observations. The unit types in the synthetic deposits would generally be recognized as representing their counterparts in nature, including cross stratasets, lobate and scroll bar deposits, and channel fills. Furthermore, the synthetic deposits have a hierarchical spatial relationship among these units consistent with observations from field exposures and geophysical images. In quantitative comparisons the proportions and the length, width, and height of unit types at different scales, across all levels of the stratal hierarchy, compare well between the synthetic and the natural deposits. A number of important attributes of the synthetic channel belt deposits are shown to be influenced by more than one level within the hierarchy of stratal architecture. First, the high-permeability open-framework gravels connected across all levels and thus formed preferential flow pathways; open-framework gravels are known to form preferential flow pathways in natural channel belt deposits. The nature of a connected cluster changed across different levels of the stratal hierarchy, and as a result of the geologic structure, the connectivity occurs at proportions of open-framework gravels below the theoretical percolation threshold for random infinite media. Second, when the channel belt model was populated with permeability distributions by lowest-level unit type, the composite permeability semivariogram contained structures that were identifiable at more than one scale, and each of these structures could be directly linked to unit types of different scales existing at different levels within the hierarchy of strata. These collective results are encouraging with respect to our goal that this model be relevant for testing ideas in future research on flow and transport in aquifers and reservoirs with multiscale heterogeneity.

AB Stream water temperature plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems where it controls many important biological and physical processes. Reliable estimates of water temperature at the daily time step are critical in managing water resources. We developed a parsimonious piecewise Bayesian model for estimating daily stream water temperatures that account for temporal autocorrelation and both linear and nonlinear relationships with air temperature and discharge. The model was tested at 8 climatically different basins of the USA and at 34 sites within the mountainous Boise River Basin (Idaho, USA). The results show that the proposed model is robust with an average root mean square error of 1.25 degrees C and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.92 over a 2-year period. Our approach can be used to predict historic daily stream water temperatures in any location using observed daily stream temperature and regional air temperature data.

AB Thermal infrared sensing of evapotranspiration (E) through surface energy balance (SEB) models is challenging due to uncertainties in determining the aerodynamic conductance (g(A)) and due to inequalities between radiometric (T-R) and aerodynamic temperatures (T-0). We evaluated a novel analytical model, the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC1.2), that physically integrates T-R observations into a combined Penman-Monteith Shuttleworth-Wallace (PM-SW) framework for directly estimating E, and overcoming the uncertainties associated with T0 and gA determination. An evaluation of STIC1.2 against high temporal frequency SEB flux measurements across an aridity gradient in Australia revealed a systematic error of 10-52% in E from mesic to arid ecosystem, and low systematic error in sensible heat fluxes (H) (12-25%) in all ecosystems. Uncertainty in TR versus moisture availability relationship, stationarity assumption in surface emissivity, and SEB closure corrections in E were predominantly responsible for systematic E errors in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. A discrete correlation (r) of the model errors with observed soil moisture variance (r = 0.33-0.43), evaporative index (r = 0.77-0.90), and climatological dryness (r = 0.60-0.77) explained a strong association between ecohydrological extremes and T-R in determining the error structure of STIC1.2 predicted fluxes. Being independent of any leaf-scale biophysical parameterization, the model might be an important value addition in working group (WG2) of the Australian Energy and Water Exchange (OzEWEX) research initiative which focuses on observations to evaluate and compare biophysical models of energy and water cycle components.
   Plain Language Summary Evapotranspiration modeling and mapping in arid and semi-arid ecosystems are uncertain due to empirical approximation of surface and atmospheric conductances. Here we demonstrate the performance of a fully analytical model which is independent of any leaf-scale empirical parameterization of the conductances and can be potentially used for continental scale mapping of ecosystem water use as well as water stress using thermal remote sensing satellite data.d

AB Extreme precipitation of multiple durations is responsible for major natural hazards in mountainous regions, such as flash floods and debris flows. Understanding the orographic impact on the statistics of precipitation extremes is therefore crucial for improving hydrological design and risk management strategies. Here, we use a novel statistical approach for the analysis of extremes based on ordinary events to improve our understanding of the omgraphic impact on extreme precipitation of durations ranging between 5 min and 24 h. We focus on Trentino, a rough omgraphic region in the eastern Italia Alps, and use data from 78 quality-controlled rain gauges with 5-minute resolution. We show that our framework well reproduces the statistical properties of the observed annual maxima (Nash-Sutcliffe 0.82-0.95, Bias from -4% to 7%) as well as their relation with orography. We then exploit the reduced uncertainty of this approach to quantify the omgraphic impact on precipitation right-tail statistics and on extreme return levels using a regression analysis. We identify two main modes of orographic relationship: a reverse orographic effect for hourly and sub-hourly durations (10-20% decrease per 1000 m elevation) and an orographic enhancement for durations of similar to 8 h or longer (7.5-10% increase per 1000 m elevation). We observe that these two modes result from three main precipitation regimes, which show different proportion between extreme and very-extreme events and which emerge at very short durations (similar to 20 min or shorter), mid durations (similar to 30 min-1 hour) and long durations (similar to 2 h or longer). These findings are of interest for risk management applications and climate change impact studies.

AB A double-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (DANS) model has been developed for depth-limited open channel flows over gravels. Three test cases are used to validate the model: an open-channel flow over a densely packed gravel bed with small-scale uniform roughness (D/d(50) similar to 13, d(50) = median diameter of roughness elements, D = water depth), open-channel flows over large-scale sparsely distributed roughness elements (D/Delta similar to 2.3-8.7, Delta = roughness height) and steep slope gravel-bed river flows with D/d(50) similar to 7-25. Various methods of treatment of the gravel-induced resistance effect have been investigated. The results show that the wall function approach (WFA) is successful in simulating flows over small gravels but is not appropriate for large gravels since the vertical profile of the longitudinal velocity does not follow the logarithmic-linear relationship. The drag force method (DFM) performs better but the non-logarithmic velocity distribution generated by sparsely distributed gravels cannot be simulated accurately. Noting that the turbulence length scale within the gravel layer is governed by the gravel size, the DANS model incorporating the DFM and a modified Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) turbulence closure is proposed. The turbulence length scale parameter in the S-A model is modified to address the change in the turbulence structure within the gravel layer. The computed velocity profiles agree well with the corresponding measured profiles in all cases. Particularly, the model reproduces the S-shape velocity profile for sparsely distributed large size roughness elements. The modeling methodology is robust and can be easily integrated into the existing numerical models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An overview is given on the predictive quality of spatially distributed runoff and erosion models. A summary is given of the results of model comparison workshops organized by the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems Focus 3 programme, as well as other results obtained by individual researchers. The results concur with the generally held viewpoint in the literature that the predictive quality of distributed models is moderately good for total discharge at the outlet, and not very good for net soil loss. This is only true if extensive calibration is done: uncalibrated results are generally bad. The more simple lumped models seem to perform equally well as the more complex distributed models, although the latter produce more detailed spatially distributed results that can aid the researcher. All these results are outlet based: models are tested on lumped discharge and soil loss or on hydrographs and sedigraphs. Surprisingly few tests have been done on the comparison of simulated and modelled erosion patterns, although this may arguably be just as important in the sense of designing anti-erosion measures and determining source and sink areas. Two studies are shown in which the spatial performance of the erosion model LISEM (Limburg soil erosion model) is analysed. It seems that: (i) the model is very sensitive to the resolution (grid cell size); (ii) the spatial pattern prediction is not very good; (iii) the performance becomes better when the results are resampled to a lower resolution and (iv) the results are improved when certain processes in the model (in this case gully incision) are restricted to so called 'critical areas', selected from the digital elevation model with simple rules.
   The difficulties associated with calibrating and validating spatially distributed soil erosion models are, to a large extent, due to the large spatial and temporal variability of soil erosion phenomena and the uncertainty associated with the input parameter values used in models to predict these processes. They will, therefore, not be solved by constructing even more complete, and therefore more complex, models. However, the situation may be improved by using more spatial information for model calibration and validation rather than output data only and by using 'optimal' models, describing only the dominant processes operating in a given landscape.

AB Chemico-osmosis is a recognized phenomenon taking place in clay mineral-rich sedimentary formations and a number of questions have been raised concerning its potential effects on pressure fields in and around underground radioactive waste repositories installed in such formations. Certain radioactive waste packages contain large quantities of nitrate salts whose release might result in the presence of highly concentrated salt solutions in the disposal cells, during their resaturation after closure of the facility. This would lead to large solute concentration gradients within the formation's porewater which could then potentially induce significant chemico-osmotic fluxes. In this paper, we assess the impact of chemico-osmotic fluxes on the water pressure during the post-closure period of a typical disposal cell for intermediate-level, long-lived bituminised radioactive waste in the Callovo-Oxfordian Clay formation. A numerical model of chemico-osmotic water flow and solute transport has been developed based on the work of Bader and Kooi (2005) [5], and including Bresler's dependence of osmotic efficiency on concentration and compaction state [9]. Model validity has been extended to highly concentrated solutions by incorporating a concentration-dependent activity coefficient, based on the Pitzer's equations. Results show that due to the strong dependence of the osmotic coefficient on concentration, the impact of chemico-osmosis on water flow and on the pressure field around the disposal cell is relatively low. A maximum overpressure of the order of 1 MPa was obtained. No difference in the simulation results were noticed for disposal cell solutions having concentrations higher than 1 M NaNO3. Differences between simulations were found to be almost entirely due to Bresler's relationship i.e., the model of the dependence between osmotic efficiency and concentration, and only slightly on the activity coefficient correction. Questions remain regarding the appropriate function to use for describing the dependence of osmotic efficiency on salt concentration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Obtaining highly-resolved velocity data from experimental measurements in porous media is a significant challenge. The goal of this work is to compare the velocity fields measured in a randomly-packed porous medium obtained from particle image velocimetry (PIV) with corresponding fields predicted from direct numerical simulation (DNS). Experimentally, the porous medium was comprised of 15 mm diameter spherical beads made of optical glass placed in a glass flow cell to create the packed bed. A solution of ammonium thiocyanate was refractive-index matched to the glass creating a medium that could be illuminated with a laser sheet without distortion. The bead center locations were quantified using the imaging system so that the geometry of the porous medium was known very accurately. Two-dimensional PIV data were collected and processed to provide high-resolution velocity fields at a single plane within the porous medium. A Cartesian-grid-based fictitious domain approach was adopted for the direct numerical simulation of flow through the same geometry as the experimental measurements and without any adjustable parameters. The uncertainties associated with characterization of the pore geometry, PIV measurements, and DNS predictions were all systematically quantified. Although uncertainties in bead position measurements led to minor discrepancies in the comparison of the velocity fields, the axial and normal velocity deviations exhibited normalized root mean squared deviations (NRMSD) of only 11.32% and 4.74%, respectively. The high fidelity of both the experimental and numerical methods have significant implications for understanding and even for engineering the micro macro relationship in porous materials. The ability to measure and model sub-pore-scale flow features also has relevance to the development of upscaled models for flow in porous media, where physically reasonable closure models must be developed at the sub pore scale. These results provide valuable data in support of that goal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We report the results of an experimental investigation into the multiphase flow properties of CO2 and water in four distinct sandstone rocks: a Berea sandstone and three reservoir rocks from formations into which CO2 injection is either currently taking place or is planned. Drainage relative permeability and residual gas saturations were measured at 50 degrees C and 9 MPa pore pressure using the steady state method in a horizontal core flooding apparatus with fluid distributions observed using x-ray computed tomography. Absolute permeability, capillary pressure curves, and petrological studies were performed on each sample. Relative permeability in the four samples is consistent with general characteristics of drainage in strongly water-wet rocks. Measurements in the Berea sample are also consistent with past measurements in Berea sandstones using both CO2/brine and oil/water fluid systems. Maximum observed saturations and permeabilities are limited by the capillary pressure that can be achieved in the experiment and do not represent endpoint values. It is likely that maximum saturations observed in other studies are limited in the same way and there is no indication that low endpoint relative permeabilities are a characteristic of the CO2/water system. Residual trapping in three of the rocks is consistent with trapping in strongly water-wet systems, and the results from the Berea sample are again consistent with observations in past studies. This confirms that residual trapping can play a major role in the immobilization of CO2 injected into the subsurface. In the Mt. Simon sandstone, a nonmonotonic relationship between initial and residual CO2 saturations is indicative of a rock that is mixed or intermediate wet, and further investigations should be performed to establish the wetting properties of illite-rich rocks. The combined results suggest that the petrophysical properties of the multiphase flow of CO2/water through siliciclastic rocks is for the most part typical of a strongly water-wet system and that analog fluids and conditions may be used to characterize these properties. Further investigation is required to identify the wetting properties of illite-rich rocks during imbibition processes.

AB Extracting water from soils is often a critical step for obtaining soil water isotope information. Cryogenic vacuum extraction (CVE), the most widely used laboratory-based removal technique, produces biased isotope composition and the mechanisms causing the biases remain uncertain. Here, we conducted spiking tests on soil samples oven-dried at 105 and 205 degrees C, respectively. The recovery rate and isotopic composition of the extracted water were analysed. Our results show that conventional oven-drying (105 degrees C) was not sufficient to liberate tightly bound water from soils but oven-drying at temperatures above 205 degrees C was. Part of the tightly bound water in soil was extracted by CVE, because the extraction capacity of CVE (heating at 95 degrees C) was equivalent to oven-drying at temperature between 105 and 205 degrees C. Moreover, the two pretreatments yielded markedly differences in water recovery rates. And with increasing ratios of clay contents to water contents, the recovery rates of the pretreated soil at 105 degrees C trended upward above 100%, but that of 205 degrees C trended downward below 100%. Further, the H-2 and O-18 signatures of the extracted water from the soil pretreated at 205 degrees C were both depleted relative to reference water, but the pretreatment at 105 degrees C showed enriched O-18 and depleted H-2. This suggests that oxygen isotope exchange may have occurred between tightly bound water and soil minerals, resulting in enriched O-18 in water for the 105 degrees C pretreatments. For the 205 degrees C pretreatment, pre-existing soil water was completely removed and relative to spiking water, isotopic signatures of the extracted water followed equilibrium fractionation law due to incomplete extraction. Therefore, our results suggested that the biased isotopic signatures of water extracted by CVE may be partially due to incomplete extraction and mixture of added water with the residual tightly bound water that pre-exists before spiking.

ID EQUATIONS
AB In the paper the conservative properties of the simplified flood routing models in form of the advective or advective-diffusive transport equation are analysed. The aim of the analysis is to explain the reasons of the mass balance error, which is observed in the numerical solutions of both non-linear kinematic and diffusive wave equations. It appeared that depending on the assumed conservative form of the kinematic wave equation, this model satisfies either the global mass conservation law or the global momentum conservation law. Both taws are satisfied simultaneously by the linear equation only. Moreover it is shown that for the non-linear diffusive wave model with the flow discharge Q(x, t) as unknown, the mass and momentum balance errors cannot be eliminated. This is caused by the presence of a diffusion term in the non-divergent form, which arises during the derivation the non-linear diffusive wave model. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding and predicting non-Newtonian fluid flows in porous media is crucial for many geophysical and environmental problems. Although extensive studies have investigated nonlinear flow for shear thinning fluids, the critical Reynolds number (Re-c) for identifying nonlinearity in transition from rheology-dominated to inertiadominated flows remains unclear. To determine Re-c, we conducted hundreds of direct numerical simulations of power law fluids with diverse fluid rheology (quantified by a power law exponent n) through a variety of pore geometries which are characterized by a non-dimensional hydraulic shape factor (beta). The numerically-derived pressure gradient and fluid flux were used to compute the bulk viscosity similar to Reynolds number curves, which were further employed to determine Re-c. With knowing Re-c, we established a predictive function between Re-c and (beta, n). This function allows for the estimation of Re-c based on the measurable properties (beta, n) via imaging technique. Our mechanistic modelling work sheds light on predicting nonlinear flow for non-Newtonian fluids at the continuum scale by knowing under what conditions the inertial effects are significant.

AB Mine reclamation in the Athabasca oil sands region Canada, is required by law where companies must reconstruct disturbed landscapes into functioning ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and lakes that existed in the Boreal landscape prior to mining. Winter is a major hydrological factor in this region as snow covers the landscape for 5-6 months and is similar to 25% of the annual precipitation, yet few studies have explored the influence of winter processes on the hydrology of constructed watersheds. One year (2017-2018) of intensive snow hydrology measurements are supplemented with 6 years (2013-2018) of meteorological measurements from the constructed Sandhill Fen watershed to: (a) understand snow accumulation and redistribution, snowmelt timing, rate, and partitioning, (b) apply a physically based model for simulating winter processes on hillslopes, and (c) evaluate the impact of soil prescriptions and climate change projections on winter processes in reclaimed systems. The 2017-2018 snow season was between November and April and snow water equivalent (SWE) ranged between 40 and 140 mm. Snow distribution was primarily influenced by topography with little influence of snow trapping from developing vegetation. Snow accumulation was most variable on hillslopes and redistribution was driven by slope position, with SWE greatest at the base of slopes and decreased toward crests. Snowmelt on hillslopes was controlled by slope aspect, as snow declined rapidly on west and south-facing slopes, compared with east and north-facing slopes. Unlike results previously reported on constructed uplands, snowmelt runoff from uplands was much less (similar to 30%), highlighting the influence of different construction materials. Model simulations indicate that antecedent soil moisture and soil temperature have a large influence on partitioning snowmelt over a range of observed conditions. Under a warmer and wetter climate, average annual peak SWE, and snow season duration could decline up to 52% and up to 61 days, respectively, while snowmelt runoff ceases completely under the warmest scenarios. Results suggest considerable future variability in snowmelt runoff from hillslopes, yet soil properties can be used to enhance vertical or lateral flows.

AB Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is an important factor of water ecological environment. In the context of global warming, the LSWT of global lakes generally reveals an upward trend. With a continuous intensification of human activities and a rapid expansion of the impervious surface, urbanization has exerted an increasing impact on the environment, so the impact of human activities on LSWT cannot be ignored. Because of the special geographical location, the change of LSWT in plateau lakes has important impacts on climate diversity, biodiversity, and cultural diversity. As a result, it is critical to monitor and model the variation characteristics of LSWT in the plateau area. Based on the data set of natural factors representing climate change and human factors representing human activities, this study proposes a classification of lake types by K-Means clustering method. At watershed scale, 11 lakes in the study area are divided into three types: Natural Lake, Semi-urban Lake, and Urban Lake (UL). Based on this classification, the variation characteristics of LSWT for the eleven lakes from 2001 to 2017 are analyzed. The causal relationship and contribution of climate change and human activities to the rise of LSWT are discussed. Results show that (1) from 2001 to 2017, the annual mean of LSWT-day/night and near-surface air temperature in the 11 lakes show a warming trend, a significant correlation (R = 0.82, alpha = 0.0164 < 0.5) and a same periodicity, which indicates that near-surface air temperature is one of the main influencing factors of LSWT warming in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. (2) LSWT warming trend of UL is more obvious than those of Semi-urban Lake and Natural Lake, indicating that human activities have more significant impact on LSWT of UL. The main driving factors are the impervious surface expansion and population increase. (3) The influence of human activities on the LSWT in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau is becoming more and more significant, and it is also the main factor in causing the deterioration of lake water environment in Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.

AB A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to model the spatial distribution of snow depth in the central Spanish Pyrenees. Statistically significant non-linear relationships were found between distinct location and topographical variables and the average depth of the April snowpack at 76 snow poles from 1985 to 2000. The joint effect of the predictor variables explained more than 73% of the variance of the dependent variable. The performance of the model was assessed by applying a number of quantitative approaches to the residuals from a cross-validation test. The relatively low estimated errors and the possibility of understanding the processes that control snow accumulation, through the response curves of each independent variable, indicate that GAMs may be a useful tool for interpolating local snow depth or other climate parameters.

AB A probabilistic approach is used to simulate particle tracking along a fractal path. The particle tracking is modelled as the sum of elementary steps with independent random variables. An exponential distribution is obtained for each elementary step and a Gamma distribution or probability density function is then deduced. The relationship between fractal dispersivity and the elementary step is given. It is theoretically demonstrated that the fractal dispersion is subdiffusive and that the linear dispersion coefficient and the linear dispersivity decrease with the mean travel distance. A review of some fractal models showing an increase of the linear dispersivity is given and an explanation that shows why these models may be not correct is proposed. It is shown that the results presented are in agreement with other studies relating to the application of the fractional calculus to diffusion transport. Lastly, a relation between the fractal dimension and the order of the fractional Langevin equation is proposed. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Recent studies have illuminated the process of hydraulic redistribution, defined as the translocation of soil moisture via plant root systems, but the long-term ecohydrologic significance of this process is poorly understood. We investigated hydraulic redistribution (HR) by Prosopis velutina Woot. (velvet mesquite) in an upland savanna ecosystem over a two-year period. Our goal was to quantify patterns of HR by mesquite roots and assess how this affects tree water use and productivity. We used the heat ratio method to monitor bi-directional sap flow, an analog of HR, in both lateral and tap roots. Additionally, we monitored soil water content and used the eddy covariance technique to quantify ecosystem carbon dioxide and water exchange. Mesquite roots redistributed large amounts of water throughout the year, even during periods of canopy dormancy. Dormant season precipitation (November-March) was often taken up by shallow lateral roots and transferred downward in the soil profile by deeper lateral and tap roots. Such a transfer was also apparent when the trees were active and moisture from summer rainfall was plant available in the upper soil layers. As the upper soil layers dried, sap flow moving toward the canopy in the lateral roots diminished and water use from deeper soils increased via the taproots. The relationship between root sap flow and above-canopy fluxes suggested that deeper "stored'' water from HR allowed the trees to transpire more in the spring that followed a winter with significant downward redistribution. Patterns of lateral and tap root sap flow also implied that redistribution may extend the growing season of the trees after summer rains have ended and surface soils are dry, thus allowing the trees to photosynthesize through periods of seasonal drought. The large hydrologic magnitude and the ecological effects of HR we studied, along with mounting evidence of this process occurring in many other ecosystems, indicates that HR should be accounted for in many ecohydrologic modeling efforts.

AB [1] This paper is intended to provide insight into the controlling mechanisms of karst genesis based on an advanced modeling approach covering the characteristic hydraulics in karst systems, the dissolution kinetics, and the associated temporal decrease in flow resistance. Karst water hydraulics is strongly governed by the interaction between a highly conductive low storage conduit network and a low-conductive high-storage rock matrix under variable boundary conditions. Only if this coupling of flow mechanisms is considered can an appropriate representation of other relevant processes be achieved, e.g., carbonate dissolution, transport of dissolved solids, and limited groundwater recharge. Here a parameter study performed with the numerical model Carbonate Aquifer Void Evolution (CAVE) is presented, which allows the simulation of the genesis of karst aquifers during geologic time periods. CAVE integrates several important features relevant for different scenarios of karst evolution: (1) the complex hydraulic interplay between flow in the karst conduits and in the small fissures of the rock matrix, (2) laminar as well as turbulent flow conditions, (3) time-dependent and nonuniform recharge to both flow systems, (4) the widening of the conduits accounting for appropriate physicochemical relationships governing calcite dissolution kinetics. This is achieved by predefining an initial network of karst conduits ("protoconduits'') which are allowed to grow according to the amount of aggressive water available due to hydraulic boundary conditions. The increase in conduit transmissivity is associated with an increase in conduit diameters while the conductivity of the fissured system is assumed to be constant in time. The importance of various parameters controlling karst genesis is demonstrated in a parameter study covering the recharge distribution, the upgradient boundary conditions for the conduit system, and the hydraulic coupling between the conduit network and the rock matrix. In particular, it is shown that conduit diameters increase in downgradient or upgradient direction depending on the spatial distribution (local versus uniform) of the recharge component which directly enters the conduit system.

AB In this study, a model based on tin artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to forecast the runoff of a meso-scale, partly glaciated (40%), Alpine catchment area in the southernmost Andes in Patagonia, Chile. The study area is located in a maritime climate with a mean annual air temperature of +5.7 degrees C and about 5500 mill of precipitation per year at sea level.
   The muitilayer feed-forward network is designed to make use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to increase the speed of computation (convergence). Using climate data recorded at an automatic weather station nearby its well its water level records measured simultaneously, the ANN model was trained and verified using independent training and validation datasets. Parameters and the corresponding time lags were determined by statistical methods such its partial, cross- and autocorrelation. The results of the simulation confirm that the proposed model was able to identify the underlying non-linear relationships between the input parameters and the observed discharge. The correlation during validation shows it significant correlation coefficient of 0.98, and an RMSE of 0.02 in respectively. However, it is almost impossible to decipher the internal behaviour of ANN due to its black-box character. Nevertheless, valuable insights were gained in the complex input-output relationships, and the occurrence of dependencies between different input variables were detected using global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The results of the GSA were compared with those of multiple linear regression (MLR). While the performance of the ANN is much better than the MLR, both models return similar results in terms of the dependency of the discharge upon input variables. It was found that despite the large proportion of glaciated surface area within the catchment, discharge is mainly controlled by precipitation (49%). Furthermore, the runoff is slightly influenced by temperature (1970), global radiation (15%) and wind speed (16%).
   While the ANN proves to be a very efficient tool for simulating runoff in glacerized, Alpine catchments from meteorological data, the GSA method, as outlined and used in this paper, offers a useful approach of analysing ANN Output. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Data on riverine fluxes are essential for calculating element cycles (carbon, nutrients, pollutants) and erosion rates from regional to global scales. At most water-quality stations throughout the world, riverine fluxes are calculated from continuous flow data (q) and discrete concentration data (C), the latter being the main cause of sometimes large uncertainties. This article offers a comprehensive approach for predicting the magnitude of these uncertainties for water-quality stations in medium to large basins (drainage basin area>1000km(2)) based on the commonly used discharge-weighted method. Uncertainty levels - biases and imprecisions - for sampling intervals of 3 to 60days are correlated first through a nomograph with a flux variability indicator, the quantity of riverine material discharged in 2% of time (M-2%). In turn, M-2% is estimated from the combination of a hydrological reactivity index, W-2% (the cumulative flow volume discharged during the upper 2% of highest daily flow) and the truncated b(50sup) exponent, quantifying the concentration versus discharge relationship for the upper half of flow values (C=a q(b50sup), for q>q(50), where q(50) is the median flow): M-2%=W-2%+27.6b(50sup). W-2% can be calculated from continuous flow measurements, and the b(50sup) indicator can be calculated from infrequent sampling, which makes it possible to predict a priori the level of uncertainty at any station, for any type of riverine material either concentrated (b(50sup)>0) or diluted (b(50sup)>0) with flow. A large data base of daily surveys, 125 station variables of suspended particulate matter (SPM), total dissolved solids (TDS) and dissolved and particulate nutrients, was used to determine uncertainties from simulated discrete surveys and to establish relationships between indicators. Results show, for example, that for the same relatively reactive basin (W-2%>25%), calculated fluxes from monthly sampling would yield uncertainties approaching +/- 100% for SPM (b(50sup)>1.4) fluxes and +/- 10% for TDS (b(50sup)=-0.2). The application to the nitrate survey of the river Seine shows significant trends for the 1972-2009 records. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The paper presents a rheological model for gravity driven granular flows saturated with water. The model adopts the kinetic theory for the collisional regime, which is dominant near the free surface, while for the frictional regime a specific model is proposed, which matches the Coulombian condition at the boundary with the loose static bed. The solution for the frictional regime is based on the observation that the frictional and the collisional regimes are not stratified but coexist across the flow depth.
   The model is able to predict the distribution along the depth of velocity, concentration, granular temperature, shear and normal stresses. In particular, it is possible to discriminate between the collisional and the frictional components of the normal and shear stresses.
   The results of the model are compared with the data of a laboratory investigation on a steady, uniform, highly concentrated saturated granular flow, composed of spheres with a uniform diameter of 6 mm.
   Another important issue addressed in the paper concerns the balances of the kinetic energy of the granular phase. The model is able to describe the mechanisms of production, diffusion and dissipation of kinetic energy, relevant to both the mean component of the flow and the fluctuating component (i.e., the collisional component). Also in this case the comparison with the experimental data is reasonably good. Near the static loose bed, the model predicts that the flux of the diffused fluctuating energy exceeds an order of magnitude the locally dissipated flux of fluctuating energy. This suggests that the motion of the grains, even at concentrations close to that of packing, is always accompanied by a certain degree of granular temperature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Contaminants in groundwater may experience a broad spectrum of velocities and multiple rates of mass transfer between mobile and immobile zones during transport. These conditions may lead to non-Fickian plume evolution which is not well described by the advection-dispersion equation (ADE). Simultaneously, many groundwater contaminants are degraded by processes that may be modeled as first-order decay. It is now known that non-Fickian transport and reaction are intimately coupled, with reaction affecting the transport operator. However, closed-form solutions for these important scenarios have not been published for use in applications. In this paper, we present four new Green's function analytic solutions in the uncoupled, uncorrelated continuous time random walk (CTRW) framework for reactive non-Fickian transport, corresponding to the quartet of conservative tracer solutions presented by Kreft and Zuber (1978) for Fickian transport. These consider pulse injection for both resident and flux concentration combined with detection in both resident and flux concentration. A pair of solutions for resident concentration temporal pulses with detection in both flux and resident concentration is also presented. We also derive the relationship between flux and resident concentration for non-Fickian transport with first-order reaction for this CTRW formulation. An explicit discussion of employment of the new solutions to model transport with arbitrary upgradient boundary conditions as well as mobile-immobile mass transfer is then presented. Using the new solutions, we show that first-order reaction has no effect on the anomalous spatial spreading rate of concentration profiles, but produces breakthrough curves at fixed locations that appear to have been generated by Fickian transport. Under the assumption of a Pareto CTRW transition distribution, we present a variety of numerical simulations including results showing coherence of our analytic solutions and CTRW particle tracking.

AB Understanding groundwater-surface water exchange in river banks is crucial for effective water management and a range of scientific disciplines. While there has been much research on bank storage, many studies assume idealized aquifer systems. This paper presents a field-based study of the Tambo Catchment (southeast Australia) where the Tambo River interacts with both an unconfined aquifer containing relatively young and fresh groundwater (<500S/cm and <100years old) and a semi-confined artesian aquifer containing old and saline groundwater (electrical conductivity>2500S/cm and >10000years old). Continuous groundwater elevation and electrical conductivity monitoring within the different aquifers and the river suggest that the degree of mixing between the two aquifers and the river varies significantly in response to changing hydrological conditions. Numerical modelling using MODFLOW and the solute transport package MT3DMS indicates that saline water in the river bank moves away from the river during flooding as hydraulic gradients reverse. This water then returns during flood recession as baseflow hydraulic gradients are re-established. Modelling also indicates that the concentration of a simulated conservative groundwater solute can increase for up to similar to 34days at distances of 20 and 40m from the river in response to flood events approximately 10m in height. For the same flood event, simulated solute concentrations within 10m of the river increase for only similar to 15days as the infiltrating low-salinity river water drives groundwater dilution. Average groundwater fluxes to the river stretch estimated using Darcy's law were 7m(3)/m/day compared with 26 and 3m(3)/m/day for the same periods via mass balance using Radon (Rn-222) and chloride (Cl), respectively. The study shows that by coupling numerical modelling with continuous groundwater-surface water monitoring, the transient nature of bank storage can be evaluated, leading to a better understanding of the hydrological system and better interpretation of hydrochemical data.

AB This paper quantitatively analyzed the evolution of human-water relationships in the Heihe River basin of northern China over the past 2000 years by reconstructing the catchment water balance by partitioning precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff. The results provided the basis for investigating the impacts of societies on hydrological systems. Based on transition theory and the rates of changes of the population, human water consumption and the area of natural oases, the evolution of human-water relationships can be divided into four stages: predevelopment (206 BC-AD 1368), take-off (AD 1368-1949), acceleration (AD 1949-2000), and the start of a rebalancing between human and ecological needs (post AD2000). Our analysis of the evolutionary process revealed that there were large differences in the rate and scale of changes and the period over which they occurred. The transition of the human-water relationship had no fixed pattern. This understanding of the dynamics of the human-water relationship will assist policy makers in identifying management practices that require improvement by understanding how today's problems were created in the past, which may lead to more sustainable catchment management in the future.

ID NONSTATIONARY SPECTRAL METHOD; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; SOILS
AB This paper describes a stochastic analysis of steady state flow in a bounded, partially saturated heterogeneous porous medium subject to distributed infiltration. The presence of boundary conditions leads to non-uniformity in the mean unsaturated flow, which in turn causes non-stationarity in the statistics of velocity fields. Motivated by this, our aim is to investigate the impact of boundary conditions on the behavior of field-scale unsaturated flow. Within the framework of spectral theory based on Fourier-Stieltjes representations for the perturbed quantities, the general expressions for the pressure head variance, variance of log unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and variance of the specific discharge are presented in the wave number domain. Closed-form expressions are developed for the simplified case of statistical isotropy of the log hydraulic conductivity field with a constant soil pore-size distribution parameter. These expressions allow us to investigate the impact of the boundary conditions, namely the vertical infiltration from the soil surface and a prescribed pressure head at a certain depth below the soil surface. It is found that the boundary conditions are critical in predicting uncertainty in bounded unsaturated flow. Our analytical expression for the pressure head variance in a one-dimensional, heterogeneous flow domain, developed using a nonstationary, spectral representation approach [Li S-G, McLaughlin D. A nonstationary spectral method for solving stochastic groundwater problems: unconditional analysis. Water Resour Res 1991;27(7):1589-605; Li S-G, McLaughlin D.

ID ELASTIC-WAVES; POROUS-MEDIA
AB The strong coupling of applied stress and pore fluid pressure, known as poroelasticity, is relevant to a number of applied problems arising in hydrogeology and reservoir engineering. The standard theory of poroelastic behavior in a homogeneous, isotropic, elastic porous medium saturated by a viscous, compressible fluid is due to Biot, who derived a pair of coupled partial differential equations that accurately predict the existence of two independent dilatational (compressional) wave motions, corresponding to in-phase and out-of-phase displacements of the solid and fluid phases, respectively. The Biot equations can be decoupled exactly after Fourier transformation to the frequency domain, but the resulting pair of Helmholtz equations cannot be converted to partial differential equations in the time domain and, therefore, closed-form analytical solutions of these equations in space and time variables cannot be obtained. In this paper we show that the decoupled Helmholtz equations can in fact be transformed to two independent partial differential equations in the time domain if the wave excitation frequency is very small as compared to a critical frequency equal to the kinematic viscosity of the pore fluid divided by the permeability of the porous medium. The partial differential equations found are a propagating wave equation and a dissipative wave equation, for which closed-form solutions are known under a variety of initial and boundary conditions. Numerical calculations indicate that the magnitude of the critical frequency for representative sedimentary materials containing either water or a nonaqueous phase liquid is in the kHz-MHz range, which is generally above the seismic band of frequencies. Therefore, the two partial differential equations obtained should be accurate for modeling elastic wave phenomena in fluid-saturated porous media under typical low-frequency conditions applicable to hydrogeological problems.

AB Groundwater flow is one of the main driving factors in the erosion of streambanks, particularly during return flow of bank storage as sediment particles on the bank face may be entrapped or liquefied by seepage flow into the stream, and when acting in concert with fluvial forces. Previous research has mainly focused on seepage erosion mechanisms, whereas in this study, a remedial solution using randomly distributed 6-mm-long polypropylene fibers mimicking the behavior of plant roots in slopes was investigated by laboratory physical streambank model experiments. Reduced-scale sandy (14 kN/m(3) unit weight) streambank models (45 degrees bank slope) with dimensions of 195 cm long, 100 cm wide and 110 cm high were constructed in an erosion flume. Two different seepage gradients were generated within the streambanks by maintaining piezometric heads of 50 cm H2O and 100 cm-H2O in the upstream section of the erosion flume during experiments. Models were equipped with vibrating wire piezometers to measure the pore-water pressures within the streambank. In addition, tensiometers measured pore-water pressures near the wall section. Erosion of sediment from the streambank initiated concurrently as seepage flow emerged on the bare streambank surface. Erosion volumes were computed by three-dimensional laser scanning. Triaxial compression tests on sand samples (fiber gravimetric content ranged from 0% to 1.0%) indicated an increase in cohesion by fiber content. Fibrous streambank protection with 0.3% fiber content inclusion reduced the total amount of seepage erosion by 35%, and 47% under 50-, and 100 cm-H2O piezometric head boundary condition (BC), respectively. Seepage erosion rate and seepage discharge demonstrated a power-law relationship. Due to the increased cohesion, fibrous streambank protection with 1.0% fiber content effectively prevented seepage erosion during streambank experiments under the same BCs.

AB This article describes and formulates a model designed to simulate runoff in wet weather events, called reservoir rainfallrunoff geomorphological model (R3GeM). In these wetlands, soil saturation is the main mechanism for the generation of surface runoff. To determine the saturated areas, the model applies a relationship based on the topographic index, between watershed storage and saturated surface. Precipitation is separated into surface runoff by saturation, subsurface runoff and losses; then, the flow of surface and subsurface runoff is performed. This hydrological model has five parameters and has been implemented in 37 events in Aixola watershed and 15 in Oiartzun watershed, both located on the Cantabrian coast of Spain. We analysed the influence of these five parameters in their behaviour, and we have proven, noting the efficiency gains, that the proposed model is valid to simulate the rainfallrunoff process.

The approach also allows the simultaneous computation of the stage hydrograph corresponding to a given inflow or the routed hydrograph. This first paper also describes the solution procedure for routing the discharge hydrograph. A second paper (Perumal, 1994b) presents a verification of the methodology.

AB The human-water relationship (HWR) has shifted from the simple utilization of water resources to a complex spatial redistribution process through powerful human activities, such as water conservancy projects and policies. Water conservancy projects have changed the HWR; however, it is still unclear how related policies, such as the ecological civilization policy recently advocated by the Chinese government, affect the HWR. Here, a nearly 600-year typical Tunpu village named Baojia Tun was taken as the study area. Based on an improved water balance formula and a new technology known as remote sensing hydrological station (RSHS), the water cycle process over nearly 600 years in the typical Tunpu village named Baojia Tun and its basin was reconstructed, and the long-term evolution of the HWR over different space and time spans was revealed. The results show that (1) the HWR developed from an initial resource-rich balanced stage to an extensive-development unbalanced stage and finally transformed into a rebalancing stage; the four stages of the HWR are predevelopment, take-off, ac-celeration, and rebalancing. (2) At the village scale, due to the suitable geographical conditions and cultural value, the composition of water use units in the water cycle process of Baojia Tun has generally remained stable from the Ming Dynasty to modern times. (3) At the basin scale, due to the increased runoff caused by land use/cover change being more significant than the decreased runoff caused by irrigation water intake, the trend of runoff shifted from slowly decreasing to accelerated increases, with the change rate of runoff increasing from -6.21 x 10(4) m(3)center dot a(-1) in the Ming Dynasty (1470-1636) to 48.78 x 104 m(3)center dot a(-1) in the China stage (1949-2020). (4) The synchronous promotion of socioeconomic development and the ecological civilization policy has realized the unity of socioeconomic and ecological benefits, making the HWR exhibit a good sign of rebalancing. This research reveals that the positive effect of ecological civilization policy on the HWR can eliminate the unfavourable factors in the previous development model and adjust it to a sustainable development model, providing significant enlightenment for long-term planning and policy formulation for sustainable high-quality develop-ment in other countries or regions.

TI Effects of thermal vapor diffusion on seasonal dynamics of water in the
   unsaturated zone
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB The response of water in the unsaturated zone to seasonal changes of temperature (T) is determined analytically using the theory of nonisothermal water transport in porous media, and the solutions are tested against field observations of moisture potential and bomb fallout isotopic (Cl-36 and H-3) concentrations. Seasonally varying land surface temperatures and the resulting subsurface temperature gradients induce thermal vapor diffusion. The annual mean vertical temperature gradient is close to zero; however, the annual mean thermal vapor flux is downward, because the temperature-dependent vapor diffusion coefficient is larger, on average, during downward diffusion (occurring at high T) than during upward diffusion (low T). The annual mean thermal vapor flux is shown to decay exponentially with depth; the depth (about 1 m) at which it decays to e(-1) of its surface value is one half of the corresponding decay depth for the amplitude of seasonal temperature changes; This depth-dependent annual mean flux is effectively a source of water, which must be balanced by a flux divergence associated with other transport processes. In a relatively humid environment the liquid fluxes greatly exceed the thermal vapor fluxes, so such a balance is readily achieved without measurable effect on the dynamics of water in the unsaturated zone. However, if the mean vertical water flux through the unsaturated zone is very small (<1 mm y(-1)), as it may be at many locations in a desert landscape, the thermal vapor flux must be balanced mostly by a matric-potential-induced upward flux of water. This return flux may include both vapor and liquid components. Below any near-surface zone of weather-related fluctuations of matric potential, maintenance of this upward flux requires an increase with depth in the annual mean matric potential; this theoretical prediction is supported by long-term field measurements in the Chihuahuan Desert. The analysis also makes predictions, confirmed by the field observations, regarding the seasonal variations of matric potential at a given depth. The conceptual model of unsaturated zone water transport developed here implies the possibility of near-surface trapping of any aqueous constituent introduced at the surface.

AB This paper is addressed towards the problem of extracting appropriate model structures by systematic analysis of rainfall-runoff relationships in gauged catchments. The Upper Enns catchment in the Austrian Alps is selected as the basis of this study. The downward approach championed by Klemes is followed, which involves stepwise adjustment of model structure to capture the observed streamflow variability progressively at the annual, monthly, and then on to daily time scales. Throughout, we focus on emergent properties of the hydrological system at the various time scales, as detected in key signature plots and hydrographs, and model complexity is always kept to the minimum required. Any further alteration or calibration of parameter values is avoided, either with change of scales or in response to inadequate predictions. The downward approach presented leads to parsimonious water balance models with excellent performance and the minimum set of parameters, with a good balance being achieved between model performance and complexity.

TI Flow in fractured media: A modified renormalization method

ID REAL-SPACE RENORMALIZATION; CRYSTALLINE ROCKS; PERMEABILITY;
   PERCOLATION; TRANSPORT; SCALES
AB We present a methodology to account for fluid flow from microscales to macroscales in fractured media. Renormalization group (RG) theory coupled to a percolation approach provides a convenient tool to allow dealing with the complex connectivity of fracture systems and with the intricate relationship between the various scales involved and the observation scale. This method also provides us with a way to describe scale dependence of permeability (K). Two-and three-dimensional calculations can be performed for broad distributions of both conductances and fracture lengths. Here we introduce what we call a "modified renormalization" method. This method is then tentatively applied to the upper crust where many scales of fractures are present. The results are discussed relative to the 3- to 4-orders-of-magnitude increase in permeability which has been reported by some authors from sample scale to regional scale, and we examine how our model could be used to predict possible scaling laws.

AB The water table, as used routinely by hydrologists in various disciplines, is seemingly a simple concept: it marks the top of the saturated zone in porous media. But closer inspection reveals that much of the theory and practice concerning the water table are less straightforward than is often assumed. We review departures from the classical definition of the water table and consider the following phenomena: perched and inverted water tables, gas bubbles within the "saturated" zone below the water table, and water tables in dual (and multiple) porosity media. We discuss some of the different methods used for measuring the position of the water table, their relative practicalities, and how to avoid measurement errors, such as those associated with hydrological instrument response times. We question whether the water table remains a useful concept, and conclude that it does, citing the examples of groundwater resource management and the water table's use as an indicator of soil aeration. In the concluding discussion, we identify the precautions that can be taken to ensure water tables are appropriately measured and interpreted.

ID CATCHMENT; MODEL; SIMILARITY
AB The TOPMODEL framework was used to derive expressions that account for saturated and unsaturated flow through shallow soil on a hillslope. The resulting equations were the basis for a shallow-soil TOPMODEL (STOPMODEL). The common TOPMODEL theory implicitly assumes a water table below the entire watershed and this does not conceptually apply to systems hydrologically controlled by shallow interflow of perched groundwater. STOPMODEL provides an approach for extending TOPMODEL's conceptualization to apply to shallow, interflow-driven watersheds by using soil moisture deficit instead of water table depth as the state variable. Deriving STOPMODEL by using a hydraulic conductivity function that changes exponentially with soil moisture content results in equations that look very similar to those commonly associated with TOPMODEL. This alternative way of conceptualizing TOPMODEL makes the modelling approach available to researchers, planners, and engineers who work in areas where TOPMODEL was previously believed to be unsuited, such as the New York City Watershed in the Catskills region of New York State.

Detailed examination of reports from the print media of Singapore, Malaysia and international sources constitutes the basis for a discussion of the roles the media have played between the two countries. The analysis shows how the media slowly evolved from being mainly a reporter to becoming an active platform for communication between the interested parties, acting both officially and unofficially, as well as directly and subtly, leading to shaping public opinion in either of the two countries, particularly regarding their water relationship.

AB In view of the amphiphilicity of surfactants, which can improve the hydrophilicity of polyethylene (PE) microplastics and increase the mobility of PE microplastics, the research on the transport behavior of PE microplastics under the coexistence of surfactants is still lacking and necessary. In this work, column experiments were carried out on the suspensions made of 15 surfactants mixed and dispersed with PE microplastics to explore the promoting effect of various surfactants on the transport of PE in saturated porous media. The dynamic contact angle of surfactant on PE surface and the surface tension and zeta potential of PE / surfactant dispersion system were measured. The interaction energy between PE / surfactant and medium, the adhesion of surfactant on PE surface were calculated respectively according to DLVO theory and Young's equation. The experimental results showed that different surfactants promoted the transportation of PE in the column to different degrees. The promotion degree of cationic, anionic and nonionic surfactants on PE transport from large to small were BG > PQ28 > CTAB > BLB > TLB, SDS > SLDED > DSS > SL > SDBS, POES > T40 > T80 > X100 > TX20, respectively. The recovery of PE in the column ranged from 17% to 99.93% under the surfactants. The calculation results of the adhesion of surfactant on PE surface also showed the same law. The minimum single molecule adsorption area (A(sL)) of surfactant on PE surface was negatively correlated with the recovery of PE in the column under the same type of surfactant. The high adhesion of surfactant on PE surface was caused by the small adsorption area of single molecule, which finally made PE obtain higher stability and penetration. These findings provide new insights and methods for the fate and transport of microplastic and surfactant coexisting systems in soil and the prediction of their potential risk of groundwater pollution.

AB Leakage of CO2 and associated gases into overlying aquifers as a result of geologic carbon capture and sequestration may have adverse impacts on aquifer drinking-water quality. Gas or aqueous-phase leakage may occur due to transport via faults and fractures, through faulty well bores, or through leaky confining materials. Contaminants of concern include aqueous salts and dissolved solids, gaseous or aqueous-phase organic contaminants, and acidic gas or aqueous-phase fluids that can liberate metals from aquifer minerals. Here we present a quantitative risk assessment framework to predict potential human health risk from CO2 leakage into drinking water aquifers. This framework incorporates the potential release of CO2 into the drinking water aquifer: mobilization of metals due to a decrease in PH; transport of these metals down gradient to municipal receptors; distributions of contaminated groundwater to multiple households; and exposure and health risk to individuals using this water for household purposes. Additionally, this framework is stochastic, incorporates detailed variations in geological and geostatistical parameters and discriminates between uncertain and variable parameters using a two-stage, or nested, Monte Carlo approach. This approach is demonstrated using example simulations with hypothetical, yet realistic, aquifer characteristics and leakage scenarios. These example simulations show a greater risk for arsenic than for lead for both cancer and non-cancer endpoints, an unexpected finding. Higher background groundwater gradients also yield higher risk. The overall risk and the associated uncertainty are sensitive to the extent of aquifer stratification and the degree of local-scale dispersion. These results all highlight the importance of hydrologic modeling in risk assessment. A linear relationship between carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risk was found for arsenic and suggests action levels for carcinogenic risk will be exceeded in exposure situations before noncarcinogenic action levels, a reflection of the ratio of cancer and non-cancer toxicity values. Finally, implications for ranking aquifer vulnerability due to geologic configuration, aquifer mineralogy, and leakage scenarios are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The potential for dynamic storage to serve as a metric of basin behaviour was assessed using data from five drainage basins with headwaters on the thick sand and gravel deposits of the Oak Ridges Moraine in southern Ontario, Canada. Dynamic storage was directly correlated with the ratio of variability of delta H-2 in streamflow relative to that in precipitation. This ratio has previously been shown to be inversely related to basin mean transit time (MTT), suggesting an inverse relationship between dynamic storage and MTT for the study basins. Dynamic storage was also directly correlated with interannual variability in stream runoff, baseflow and baseflow: runoff ratio, implying that basins with smaller dynamic storage have less interannual variability in their streamflow regimes. These preliminary results suggest that dynamic storage may serve as a readily derived and useful metric of basin behaviour for inter-basin comparisons. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The covariability of soil moisture with soil, vegetation, topography, and precipitation is linked by physical relationships. The influence of each of these interdependent physical controls on soil moisture spatial distribution depends on the nature of heterogeneity present in the domain and evolves with time and scale. This paper investigates the effect of three physical controls, i.e., topography (slope), vegetation (type), and soil (texture), on soil moisture spatial distribution in the Little Washita and Walnut Creek watersheds in Oklahoma and Iowa, respectively, at two support scales. Point-support-scale data collected from four soil moisture campaigns (SMEX02, SMEX03, SMEX05, and CLASIC07) and airborne-scale data from three soil moisture campaigns (SGP97, SGP99, and SMEX02) were used in this analysis. The effect of different physical controls on the spatial mean and variability of soil moisture was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis and Shannon entropy respectively. It was found that at both (point and airborne) support scales, nonuniform precipitation (forcing) across the domain can mask the effect of the dominant physical controls on the soil moisture distribution. In order to isolate land-surface controls from the impact of forcing, the effect of precipitation variability was removed. After removing the effect of precipitation variability, it was found that for most soil moisture conditions, soil texture as opposed to vegetation and topography is the dominant physical control at both the point and airborne scales in Iowa and Oklahoma. During a very wet year (2007), however, the effect of topography on the soil moisture spatial variability overrides the effect of soil texture at the point support scale. These findings are valuable for developing any physically based scaling algorithms to upscale or downscale soil moisture between the point and watershed scales in the studied watersheds in humid and subhumid regions of the Great Plains of USA. These results may also be used in designing effective soil moisture field campaigns. Citation: Gaur, N., and B. P.

AB The past decade witnessed rapid developments in remote sensing methods that now permit an unprecedented description of the spatial variations in water levels (H-w), canopy height (h(c)), and leaf area density distribution (a) at large spatial scales. These developments are now renewing interest in effective resistance formulations for water flow within and above vegetated surfaces so that they can be incorporated into simplified water routing models driven by such remote sensing products. The first generation of such water routing models linked the bulk velocity to gradients in H-w via a constant diffusion velocity that cannot be inferred from canopy properties (a and h(c)). The next generation of such hydrologic models must preserve the nonlinear relationship between the resistance value, canopy attributes (e.g., a and h(c)), and H-w without compromising model simplicity. Using a simplified scaling analysis on the depth-integrated mean momentum balance and a two-layer model for the bulk velocity, the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f) was shown to vary with three canonical length scales that can be either measured or possibly inferred from remote sensing products H-w, h(c), and the adjustment length scale L-c = (C-d a)(-1), where C-d is the drag coefficient (of order unity). The scaling analysis proposed here reveals that these length scales can be combined in two dimensionless groups, H-w/h(c) and L-c/h(c). The dependence of f on these two functional groups was then explored using a combination of first-order closure modeling and 130 experimental runs derived from a large number of flume experiments carried out for rigid and flexible vegetation. The results from the data and the model show a nonlinear decrease in f with increasing H-w/h(c) at a given L-c/h(c) and the nonlinear increase in f with decreasing L-c/h(c). Furthermore, both model and data results did not exhibit any dependence on the bulk Reynolds number.

AB Recirculation zones (RZs) are common in many geophysical flows. These zones form near irregular solid boundaries and are separate from the main flow. Since mass can be trapped and later released locally from RZs, bulk transport can exhibit long tailsan anomalous behavior that is challenging to predict. The underlying RZ mass transfer and retention in this situation is poorly understood despite common parameterization by effective exchange coefficients in mobile-immobile (MIM) domain models. We analyzed the mass transfer process using computationally resolved flow and transport fields inside two-dimensional rough fractures. RZs were delineated by a novel technique followed by quantification of mass transfer across the interface with the main flow zone. The results showed that the first-order mass transfer coefficient is a function of Reynolds number and velocity difference between the RZ and bulk flow. A distributed mobile-immobile model with the directly estimated parameters accurately reproduced bulk anomalous transport. While the distributed mobile-immobile model is not yet predictive, its development showed that mass transfer coefficients for flows involving RZs are physically meaningful, potentially predictable, and useful for elucidating local mass transfer processes within the general framework of mobile-immobile transport modeling.
   Plain Language Summary Mass transfer between a slow-flowing zone and a recirculation zone is a process found in many environmental and engineered settings. When present, these zones can substantially delay solute transport taking place in the moving bulk fluid. This usually results in the tailing of solutes, typically referred to as anomalous transport. By assuming that solute transport is diffusion-driven in the stagnant (immobile) region and advection-diffusion driven in the main flow (mobile) region, a classic mobile-immobile theory was developed and has been widely adopted to model this anomalous transport, despite loose physical background for its parameters. In this study, we present directly the mass transfer process at the interface between recirculation zone and its adjacent main flow channel. Recirculation zone volumes and mass transfer coefficients between recirculation zone and bulk flow were quantified and parameterized via an automated detection approach. This information was then fed into a parameterized distributed mobile-immobile domain transport model. The critical role of the local recirculation zones has been elucidated in capturing anomalous transport. The approaches and results in this study will be of interest to geoscientists and engineers who focus on the flow and transport phenomena in different geophysical settings with immobile zones.

AB The travel time formulation of advective transport in heterogeneous porous media is of interest both conceptually, e. g., for incorporating retention processes, and in applications where typically the travel time peak, early, and late arrivals of contaminants are of major concern in a regulatory or remediation context. Furthermore, the travel time moments are of interest for quantifying uncertainty in advective transport of tracers released from point sources in heterogeneous aquifers. In view of this interest, the travel time distribution has been studied in the literature; however, the link to the hydraulic conductivity statistics has been typically restricted to the first two moments. Here we investigate the influence of higher travel time moments on the travel time probability density function (pdf) in heterogeneous porous media combining Monte Carlo simulations with the maximum entropy principle. The Monte Carlo experimental pdf is obtained by the adaptive Fup Monte Carlo method (AFMCM) for advective transport characterized by a multi-Gaussian structure with exponential covariance considering two injection modes (in-flux and resident) and lnK variance up to 8. A maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm based on Fup basis functions is used for the complete characterization of the travel time pdf. All travel time moments become linear with distance. Initial nonlinearity is found mainly for the resident injection mode, which exhibits a strong nonlinearity within first 5I(Y) for high heterogeneity. For the resident injection mode, the form of variance and all higher moments changes from the familiar concave form predicted by the first-order theory to a convex form; for the in-flux mode, linearity is preserved even for high heterogeneity. The number of moments sufficient for a complete characterization of the travel time pdf mainly depends on the heterogeneity level. Mean and variance completely describe travel time pdf for low and mild heterogeneity, skewness is dominant for lnK variance around 4, while kurtosis and fifth moment are required for lnK variance higher than 4. Including skewness seems sufficient for describing the peak and late arrivals. Linearity of travel time moments enables the prediction of asymptotic behavior of the travel time pdf which in the limit converges to a symmetric distribution and Fickian transport. However, higher-order travel time moments may be important for most practical purposes and in particular for advective transport in highly heterogeneous porous media for a long distance from the source.

AB Despite their apparent high dimensionality, spatially distributed hydraulic properties of geologic formations can often be compactly (sparsely) described in a properly designed basis. Hence, the estimation of high-dimensional subsurface flow properties from dynamic performance and monitoring data can be formulated and solved as a sparse reconstruction inverse problem. Recent advances in statistical signal processing, formalized under the compressed sensing paradigm, provide important guidelines on formulating and solving sparse inverse problems, primarily for linear models and using a deterministic framework. Given the uncertainty in describing subsurface physical properties, even after integration of the dynamic data, it is important to develop a practical sparse Bayesian inversion approach to enable uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we use sparse geologic dictionaries to compactly represent uncertain subsurface flow properties and develop a practical sparse Bayesian method for effective data integration and uncertainty quantification. The multi-Gaussian assumption that is widely used in classical probabilistic inverse theory is not appropriate for representing sparse prior models. Following the results presented by the compressed sensing paradigm, the Laplace (or double exponential) probability distribution is found to be more suitable for representing sparse parameters. However, combining Laplace priors with the frequently used Gaussian likelihood functions leads to neither a Laplace nor a Gaussian posterior distribution, which complicates the analytical characterization of the posterior. Here, we first express the form of the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate for Laplace priors and then use the Monte-Carlo-based Randomize Maximum Likelihood (RML) method to generate approximate samples from the posterior distribution. The proposed Sparse RML (SpRML) approximate sampling approach can be used to assess the uncertainty in the calibrated model with a relatively modest computational complexity. We demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the SpRML formulation using a series of numerical experiments of two-phase flow systems in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian property distributions in petroleum reservoirs and successfully apply the method to an adapted version of the PUNQ-S3 benchmark reservoir model.

AB The hydraulic characteristics of the plough pan of paddy fields provide continuous ponding conditions during the growing season and control the water use efficiency in wet rice production. Its saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s, however, exhibits a large spatiotemporal variability as a consequence of a highly dynamic soil structure involving temporary shrinkage cracks. Water flow through the earthen bunds surrounding the fields further contributes to the uncertainty in water flux calculations. The objective of this study was to develop a simple deterministic model with stochastic elements ('PADDY-FLUX') for depiction of deep percolation, and to assess the effect of different water management scenarios on percolation in two channel command areas. Darcy's law is used as the fundamental equation for water flow calculations with the ponding water depth h as a time-dependent variable. Flux uncertainty is estimated by a Monte-Carlo-type implementation. K-s is treated as a random variable of a bimodal probability density function (PDF), which is the weighted sum of two Gaussian PDFs (accounting for a matrix and a preferential flow domain). The weighing factor alpha is a function of h, reflecting an increasing risk for preferential flow situations after desiccation and the development of shrinkage cracks. Under-bund percolation is calculated using transfer functions. The results demonstrate that percolation losses increase in the following order: continuous soil saturation < continuous flooding (CF) < mid-season drainage and intermittent irrigation (MD C II) < mid-season drainage and continuous flooding. The bunds contribute up to 54 and 17% to total fluxes under CF and MD C II, respectively. Preferential water fluxes are responsible for the major part of water losses as soon as desiccation causes the formation of shrinkage cracks. As a conclusion, continuous soil saturation should be promoted as the least water-intensive irrigation regime, while intermittent irrigation is recommended only in case that irreversible shrinkage cracks have already developed.

AB The present study examines the vertical structure of the coastal current in the inner part of the Gulf of Taranto, located in the Ionian Sea (Southern Italy), including both the Mar Grande and Mar Piccolo basins. To this aim, different measuring stations investigated by both a Vessel Mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (VM-ADCP) and a bottom fixed ADCP were taken into consideration. Two surveys were carried out in the target area on 29.12.2006 and on 11.06.2007 by the research unit of the Technical University of Bari (DICATECh Department), using a VM-ADCP to acquire the three velocity components along the water column in selected stationing points. The measurements were taken in shallow waters, under non-breaking wave conditions, offshore the surf zone. Due to the recording frequency of the instrument time-averaged vertical velocity profiles could be evaluated in these measuring stations. Water temperature and salinity were also measured at the same time and locations by means of a CTD recorder. A rigidly mounted ADCP, located on the seabed in the North-Eastern area of the Mar Grande basin, provided current data relative to the period 10-20 February 2014. Set to acquire the three velocity components with higher frequency with respect to the VM-ADCP, it allowed us to estimate the turbulent quantities such as Reynolds stresses and turbulent kinetic energy by means of the variance method.
   Therefore, the present research is made up of two parts. The first part examines the current pattern measured by the VM-ADCP and verifies that, for each station, the classical log law reproduces well the vertical profile of the experimental streamwise velocities extending beyond its typical limit of validity up to the surface i.e. reaching great heights above the sea bed. This behavior is quite new and not always to be expected, being generally limited to boundary layers. It has been convincingly observed in only few limited experimental works. In the present study this occurred when two conditions were met: (i) the flow was mainly unidirectional along the vertical; (ii) the interested layer was non-stratified.
   The second part of the research studies the turbulent statistics derived from the beam signals of the fixed ADCP by means of the variance method. This technique had the advantage of being able to measure the time evolution of the turbulent mixing throughout the entire water column, thus making it possible to perform a detailed study on momentum transfer and turbulence. The deduced vertical profiles of the Reynolds stresses and of the turbulent kinetic energy TKE showed an increasing trend toward the surface, in agreement with previous results in literature.
   New data-sets of mean velocities and shear stresses, coming from field measurements, are always needed. In fact they represent the first step to derive reliable reference values of coefficients and parameters for the implementation and calibration of the used mathematical hydrodynamic models.
   Consequently, an effort was made to evaluate consistent bottom drag and wind drag coefficients, on the basis of the calculated bottom and surface shear stresses, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We used stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and water chemistry to characterize the water balance and hydrolimnological relationships of 57 shallow aquatic basins in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), northern Alberta, Canada, based on sampling at the end of the 2000 thaw season. Evaporation-to-inflow ratios (Ell) were estimated using an isotope mass-balance model tailored to accommodate basin-specific input water compositions, which provided an effective, first-order. quantitative framework for identifying water balances and associated limnological characteristics spanning three main, previously identified drainage types. Open-drainage basins (E/I < 0.4 n = 5). characterized by low alkalinity, low concentrations of nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ions, and high minerogenic turbidity, include large, shallow basins that dominate the interior of the PAD and experience frequent or Continuous river channel connection. Closed-drainage basins (E/I >= 1.0 n = 16), in contrast, possess high alkalinity and high concentrations of nitrogen, DOC. and ions, and low minerogenic turbidity, and are located primarily in the relict and infrequently flooded landscape of the northern Peace sector of the delta. Several basins fall into the restricted-drainage category (0.4 # E/I < 1.0; n = 26) with intermediate water chemistries and are predominant in the southern Athabasca sector, which is subject to active fluviodeltaic processes, including intermittent flooding front riverbank overflow. Integration of isotopic and limniological data also revealed evidence for a new fourth drainage type, mainly located near the large open-drainage takes that Occupy the central portion of the delta but within the Athabasca sector (n = 10). These basins were very shallow (< 50 cm deep) at the time of sampling and isotopically depleted, corresponding to Ell characteristic of restricted and open-drainage conditions. However, they are limnologically similar to closed-drainage basins except for hi,,her conductivity and higher concentrations of Ca2+ and Na+. and lower concentrations of SiO2 and chlorophyll c. These distinct features are due to the overriding influence of recent summer rainfall on the basin water balance and chemistry. The close relationships evident between water balances and limnological conditions suggest that past and future changes in hydrology are likely to be coupled with marked alterations in water chemistry and, hence, the ecology of aquatic environments in the PAD.

AB Velocity distributions for open channel flows have been investigated using deterministic and probabilistic approaches. It is well known that the vertical velocity profiles in wide open channels (i.e. aspect ratio width/depth > 5) can be approximated by logarithmic velocity laws and power laws. Recently the entropy concept in the forms of Shannon entropy and Tsallis entropy has been employed to estimate velocity distributions in open channels with different aspect ratios. The accuracy of conventional velocity equations is highly dependent on their parameters that can only be estimated by empirical or semi-empirical analytical relations which requires either a good knowledge of velocity field and/or physical properties of the channel, such as topographic conditions, sedimentation conditions and boundary roughness. In contrast, the entropy based velocity distributions derived based on the least-biased probability density function (PDF) by treating time-averaged velocities as random variables are resilient regardless of the flow and channel conditions. However, a comparison of the velocity profiles computed using deterministic approaches and probabilistic approaches has not been rigorously conducted. Furthermore, the accuracy and reliability of associated velocity distribution equations have not been tested thoroughly using data sets collected using advanced techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive and comparative study to analyze the distinctions and linkages between four commonly used velocity laws and two entropy-based velocity distributions theoretically and quantitatively using selective laboratory and field measurements available in the literature, considering typical sedimentation and channel hydraulic conditions. Amongst all, Tsallis entropy based velocity distribution developed from a generalized form of informational entropy exhibits universal validity to sediment-laden flows in wide alluvial open channels, and is found to be superior to others to predict velocity profiles in large waterways with unmanageable rough beds.

AB We developed a technique for reconstructing annual gravel yields and generated a 55-year record of gravel transport for the North Fork catchment of the Caspar Creek Experimental Watersheds in Northern California. The technique relies on field data collection including annual surveys of weir pond volumes and suspended sediment measurements, as well as an accounting for settling of suspended sediment and organic matter in the pond. We compared these annual yields to gravel yields predicted by the Wilcock two-fraction bed load transport model, which we calibrated from measured values at Caspar Creek. We considered three velocity-discharge relationships and found that values of hydraulic variables measured during storms produced the best fit between reconstructed and predicted annual gravel yields when years with large disturbances were excluded. We also compared predicted gravel transport rates to bed load transport rates measured from 1988 to 1995 with bed load pit samplers. We found that the calibrated model predictions agreed well with the field-measured bed load transport rates. To investigate the role of supply and storage on gravel transport, we compared the reconstructed gravel yields to predicted gravel yields and found that increased occurrence of landslides and headcut erosion in the 1990s and early 2000s did not lead to an increase in gravel yields. Instead, input of large downed wood in the 1990s created storage space and decreased bed load delivery to the weir pond.
   Plain Language Summary Bed load sediment yields are important for understanding catchment responses to natural and human caused disturbances, but are difficult to measure. We demonstrate a method that uses pond sediment accumulations to quantify annual bed load yields at Caspar Creek, CA. We also use these data and data collected during more focused storm-based sampling to show that a common bed load model provides relatively accurate estimates of gravel transport at Caspar Creek. Comparing annual gravel yields to predicted gravel yields reveals that gravel transport decreased in the 1990s and 2000s after a large number of trees blew down and increased the wood content in the channel. The approach presented here can be applied to other sites where similar data are available, such as other ponds or small reservoirs.

AB Rainfall is an important driver of erosion processes. The mean rainfall rate is often used to account for the erosive impact of a particular climate. However, for some erosion processes, erosion rate is a nonlinear function of rainfall, e.g., due to a threshold for erosion. When this is the case, it is important to take into account the full distribution of rainfall, instead of just the mean. In light of this, we have characterized the variability of daily rainfall over the Himalayan orogen using high spatial and temporal resolution rainfall data sets. We find significant variations in rainfall variability over the Himalayan orogen, with increasing rainfall variability to the west and north of the orogen. By taking into account variability of rainfall in addition to mean rainfall rate, we find a pattern of rainfall that, from a geomorphological perspective, is significantly different from mean rainfall rate alone. Using these findings, we argue that short-term rainfall variability may help explain observed short and long-term erosion rates in the Himalayan orogen.
   Plain Language Summary An important topic in earth science is understanding how climate and tectonic forces interact to shape the surface of the Earth. One of the main influences that climate has on the Earth's surface is to cause erosion by delivering water to landscapes as rain and snow. Wetter climates should, in general, cause more erosion than drier climates, which is why the mean annual rainfall has traditionally been used as a measure of the erosive strength of climate. However, field evidence seems to suggest that the effect of climate is more sophisticated than can be captured with the mean annual rainfall. There is a considerable body of theory demonstrating that the intensity of rainfall, or storminess, is an equally important aspect of how climate causes erosion. In light of this, we have characterized the storminess in the Himalayan mountain range, a place with high erosion rates driven by rainfall. We show that there is large variation in storminess from place to place in the Himalayas, and that this can help explain observed rates of erosion, which do not match mean annual rainfall rates.

AB Altered snowpack regimes from regional warming threaten mountain ecosystems with greater water stress and increased likelihood of vegetation disturbance. The sensitivity of vegetation to changing snowpack conditions is strongly mediated by soil water storage, yet a framework to identify areas sensitive to changing snowpack regimes is lacking. In this study we ask two questions: (1) How will changing snowmelt alter the duration of soil water stress and length of the soil-mediated growing season (shortened to water stress and growing season, respectively)? and (2) What site characteristics increase the sensitivity of water stress and growing season duration to changes in snowmelt? We compiled soil moisture at 5, 20 and 50 cm depths from 62 SNOTEL sites with > 5 years of records and detailed soil properties. Soil water stress was estimated based on measured wilting point water content. The day of snow disappearance consistently explained the greatest variability in water stress across all site-years and within individual sites, while summer precipitation explained the most variability in growing season length. On average, a one day earlier snow disappearance resulted in 0.62 days greater water stress and 36 of 62 sites had significant relationships between snow disappearance and water stress. Despite earlier snow disappearance leading to greater water stress at nearly all sites, earlier snow disappearance led to both significant increases (4 of 62) and decreases (5 of 62) in growing season length. Satellite derived vegetation greenness confirmed site-dependent changes could both increase and reduce maximum annual vegetation greenness with earlier snow disappearance. A simple soil moisture model demonstrated the potential for diverging growing season length with earlier snow disappearance was more likely in areas with finer soil texture, greater rooting depth, greater potential evapotranspiration, and greater precipitation. More work is needed to understand the role of decreasing snowpacks, summer precipitation, and deeper soil processes in modulating sensitivity to earlier snowmelt. The potential for heterogeneity in mountain environments to cause diverging growing season length from earlier snowmelt over relatively small spatial scales has important implications for water budgets and development of refugia to regional warming.

AB The group method of data handling (GMDH) algorithm presented by A. C. Ivakhnenko and colleagues is an heuristic self-organization method. It establishes the input-output relationship of a complex system using a multilayered perception-type structure that is similar to a feed-forward multilayer neural network. This study provides a step towards understanding and evaluating a role for GMDH in the investigation of the complex rainfall-runoff processes in a heterogeneous watershed in Taiwan. Two versions of the revised GMDH model are implemented: a stepwise regression procedure and a recursive formula. Eleven typhoon events in the Shen-cei Creek watershed, Taiwan, are used to build the model and verify its usefulness. The prediction results of the revised GMDH models and the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) model are compared. Based on the criteria of forecasting precision and the rate and time of peak error, a much better performance is obtained with the revised GMDH models. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Wetting and drying due to tidal fluctuations affect soil conditions and hence plant growth in tidal marshes. Here, a coupled one-dimensional model was developed to simulate interacting groundwater flow and plant growth in these wetlands. The simulation results revealed three characteristic zones of soil conditions for plant growth along a cross-creek section subjected to the combined influences of spring-neap tides and evapotranspiration: (1) a near-creek zone affected by semi-diurnal tides over the whole spring-neap cycle, where the soil is well aerated although the plant growth could be slightly limited by the local water content dropping periodically below the wilting point on the ebb tide; (2) a less well-drained zone where drainage occurs only during neap tides (for which the daily inundation is absent) and plant growth is aeration-limited; and (3) an interior zone where evapotranspiration determines the soil-water saturation. Plant growth dynamics, which depend on these soil conditions, lead to spatial biomass distributions that are consistent with the characteristic zonation. The simulations shed light on the feedback mechanism for groundwater-vegetation interactions in the marsh system. It was demonstrated that the growth of pioneer plants can improve the soil aeration condition as a result of transpiration. The strength of this feedback varies spatially in accordance with the three characteristic zones of soil-water saturation. However, the development of another species in the marsh system is likely to be more complicated than suggested by the "positive feedback" mechanism proposed previously, due to the influence of inter-species competition. The feedback effects are generally more complex, involving both plant growth enhancement and inhibition depending on the combined influence of the intra-and inter-species competition, the ecosystem's carrying capacity and plant transpiration. These findings demonstrate the interplay of ecological and hydrological processes in tidal marshes, and provide guidance for future research, including field investigations that aim to establish the principle relationship between marsh morphology and plant zonation.

AB We investigate the spatiotemporal nonlocality underlying fractional-derivative models as a possible explanation for regional-scale anomalous dispersion with heavy tails. Properties of four fractional-order advection-dispersion equation (fADE) models were analyzed and compared systematically, including the space fADEs with either maximally positive or negative skewness, the time fADE with a temporal fractional-derivative 0 < gamma < 1, and the extension of the time fADE with 1 < gamma < 2. Space fADEs describe the dependence of local concentration change on a wide range of spatial zones (i.e., the space nonlocality), while time fADEs describe dynamic mass exchange between mobile and multiple immobile phases and therefore record the temporal history of concentration "loading" (i.e., the time-nonlocality). We then applied the fADEs as models of anomalous dispersion to four extensively-studied, regional-scale, natural systems, including a hillslope composed of fractured soils, a river with simultaneous active flow zones and various dead-zones, a relatively homogeneous glaciofluvial aquifer dominated by stratified sand and gravel, and a highly heterogeneous alluvial aquifer containing both preferential flowpaths and abundant aquitards. We find that the anomalous dispersion observed at each site might not be characterized reasonably or sufficiently by previous studies. In particular, the use of the space fADE with less than maximally positive skewness implies a spatial dependence on downstream concentrations that may not be physically realistic for solute transport in watershed catchments and rivers (where the influence of dead-zones on solute transport can be described by a temporal, not spatial, fractional model). Field-scale transport studies show that large ranges of solute displacement can be described by a space nonlocal, fractional-derivative model, and long waiting times can be described efficiently by a time-nonlocal, fractional model. The unknown quantitative relationship between the nonlocal parameters and the heterogeneity, and the similarity in concentration profiles that are solutions to the different nonlocal transport models, all demonstrate the importance of distinguishing the representative nonlocality (time and/or space) for any given regional-scale anomalous dispersion process.

AB Streamflow forecasts play an important role in real-time reservoir operation, especially during the flood season. However, nowcast, short-term, and mid-term forecasts have significant differences in their uncertainties, leading to a gap between these forecasts and their combined use. To make the most of these forecasts, this paper defines a reliable forecast horizon (RFH) and proposes a model based on the three-stage-based operation rule (Three-OR), in which the streamflow forecasts are jointly used with different levels of uncertainty. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model, it is applied to the Wan'an Reservoir located at the midstream of the Ganjiang River in China with the objectives of flood control and water utilization (i.e., hydropower generation and water supply). The results reveal the following: 1) both flood control and water utilization can be improved when compared with the current operation rule; 2) floods with a higher peak and larger volume gain more improvements using Three-OR; 3) a smaller difference in the forecast error produces better operation performance in water utilization; and 4) the extension of the RFH is beneficial for reservoir operation, as it can help to improve flood control if the flood is large; otherwise, it can help improve water utilization. In summary, the proposed model based on Three-OR can make the best use of streamflow information, thus improving the real-time reservoir operation during the flood season.

AB Classical Thiem's well hydraulic theory, other aquifer test analyses, and flow modeling efforts often assume the existence of "quasi-steady" state conditions. That is, while drawdowns due to pumping continue to grow, the hydraulic gradient in the vicinity of the pumping well does not change significantly. These conditions have built upon two-dimensional and equivalent homogeneous conceptual models, but few field data have been available to affirm the existence of these conditions. Moreover, effects of heterogeneity and three-dimensional flow on this quasi-steady state concept have not been thoroughly investigated and discussed before. In this study, we first present a quantitative definition of quasi-steady state (or steady-shape conditions) and steady state conditions based on the analytical solution of two or three-dimensional flow induced by pumping in unbounded, homogeneous aquifers. Afterward, we use a stochastic analysis to investigate the influence of heterogeneity on the quasi-steady state concept in heterogeneous aquifers. The results of the analysis indicate that the time to reach an approximate quasi steady state in a heterogeneous aquifer could be quite different from that estimated based on a homogeneous model. We find that heterogeneity of aquifer properties, especially hydraulic conductivity, impedes the development of the quasi-steady state condition before the flow reaching steady state. Finally, 280 drawdown-time data from the hydraulic tomographic survey conducted at a field site corroborate our finding that the quasi-steady state condition likely would not take place in heterogeneous aquifers unless pumping tests last a long period.
   Research significance
   (1) Approximate quasi-steady and steady state conditions are defined for two- or three-dimensional flow induced by pumping in unbounded, equivalent homogeneous aquifers. (2) Analysis demonstrates effects of boundary condition, well screen interval, and heterogeneity of parameters on the existence of the quasi-steady, and validity of approximate quasi-steady concept. (3) Temporal evaluation of information content about heterogeneity in head observations are analyzed in heterogeneous aquifer. (4) 280 observed drawdown-time data corroborate the stochastic analysis that quasi-steady is difficult to reach in highly heterogeneous aquifers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When a severe drought occurs, people often question the amount of water required to recover from the drought which is difficult to determine. Here, we present a method to determine the amount of water required, including both runoff and precipitation, for hydrological drought recovery from a drought propagation perspective. We also consider multi-scale meteorological and hydrological anomaly indices (MAI and HAI) with non-standardized properties. We present three rainfall-driven basins in southern China to validate the proposed approach using long-term monthly runoff and precipitation records. Drought propagation characteristics (such as duration, severity, development, and recovery processes) were extracted using the HAI and MAI obtained via a threshold level method and run theory. The proposed method allows estimating the amount of water required, including runoff and the corresponding precipitation, for any hydrological drought to recover to normal using HAI and MAI. Moreover, a linear relationship between runoff and the corresponding precipitation was established (R-2 > 0.99) to estimate the amount of precipitation required to recover from a certain hydrological drought.

AB Dissolution trapping is one of the most important mechanisms for geological carbon storage (GCS). Recent laboratory and field experiments have shown non-equilibrium dissolution of supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)) and coupled scCO(2) dissolution and water flow, i.e., scCO(2) dissolution at local pores/pore throats creating new water-flow paths, which in turn enhance dissolution by increased advection and interfacial area. However, the impacts of pore-scale characteristics on these coupled processes have not been investigated. In this study, imbibition and dissolution experiments were conducted under 40 degrees C and 9 MPa using a homogeneous/isotropic hexagonal micromodel, two homogeneous elliptical micromodels with low or high anisotropy, and a heterogeneous sandstone-analog micromodel. The four micromodels, initially saturated with deionized (DI)-water, were drained by injecting scCO(2) to establish a stable scCO(2) saturation. DI water was then injected at different rates with logCa (the capillary number) ranging from -6.56 to -4.34. Results show that bypass of scCO(2) by displacing water is the dominant mechanism contributing to the residual CO2 trapping, triggered by heterogeneity in pore characteristics or pore-scale scCO(2)-water distribution. Bypass can be enhanced by pore heterogeneity or reduced by increasing transverse permeability, resulting in relatively low (<2% of CO2 solubility) or high (9-13% of CO2 solubility) dissolved CO2 concentration in displacing water. The overall dissolution of residual scCO(2) increases with decreasing Ca, and approaches to their solubility at low Ca value with sufficient residence time. This main trend is similar to a capillary desaturation curve that represents the relationship between the residual saturation and Ca. Spatially, dissolution initiates along the boundary of bypassed scCO(2) cluster(s) in a non-equilibrium manner, and the coupling of water flow and dissolution occurs which fragments the bypassed scCO(2) clusters and enhance scCO(2) dissolution.

AB Empirical prediction equations of the form W = aQ(h) have been reported for rills and rivers, but not for ephemeral gullies. In this study six experimental data sets are used to establish a relationship between channel width (W, m) and flow discharge (Q, m(3) s(-1)) for ephemeral gullies formed on cropland. The resulting regression equation (W = 2.51 Q(0.412); R-2 = 0.72; n = 67) predicts observed channel width reasonably well. Owing to logistic limitations related to the respective experimental set ups, only relatively small runoff discharges (i.e. Q < 0.02 m(3) s(-1)) were covered. Using field data, where measured ephemeral gully channel width was attributed to a calculated peak runoff discharge on sealed cropland, the application field of the regression equation was extended towards larger discharges (i.e. 5 x 10(-4) m(3) s(-1) < Q < 0.1 m(3) s(-1)).
   Comparing W-Q relationships for concentrated flow channels revealed that the discharge exponent (b) varies from 0.3 for rills over 0.4 for gullies to 0.5 for rivers. This shift in b may be the result of: (i) differences in flow shear stress distribution over the wetted perimeter between rills, gullies and rivers, (ii) a decrease in probability of a channel formed in soil material with uniform erosion resistance from rills over gullies to rivers and (iii) a decrease in average surface slope from rills over gullies to rivers.
   The proposed W-Q equation for ephemeral gullies is valid for (sealed) cropland with no significant change in erosion resistance with depth. Two example, illustrate limitations of the W-Q approach. In a first example, vertical erosion is hindered by a frozen subsoil. The second example relates to a typical summer Situation where the soil moisture profile of an agricultural field makes the top 0.02 in five times more erodible than the underlying soil material. For both case's observed W values are larger than those predicted by the established channel width equation for concentrated flow on cropland. For the frozen soils the equation W = 3.17 Q(0.368) (R-2 = 0.78; n = 617) was established, but for the summer soils no equation could be established. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The paper deals with the crucial problem of the groundwater parameter estimation that is the basis for efficient modeling and reclamation activities. A hierarchical Bayesian approach is developed: it uses the Akaike's Bayesian Information Criteria in order to estimate the hyperparameters (related to the covariance model chosen) and to quantify the unknown noise variance. The transmissivity identification proceeds in two steps: the first, called empirical Bayesian interpolation, uses Y*(Y = lnT) observations to interpolate Y values on a specified grid; the second, called empirical Bayesian update, improve the previous Y estimate through the addition of hydraulic head observations. The relationship between the head and the lnT has been linearized through a perturbative solution of the flow equation. In order to test the proposed approach, synthetic aquifers from literature have been considered. The aquifers in question contain a variety of boundary conditions (both Dirichelet and Neuman type) and scales of heterogeneities (sigma(2)(Y) = 1. 0 and sigma(2)(Y) = 5. 3). The estimated transmissivity fields were compared to the true one. The joint use of Y* and head measurements improves the estimation of Y considering both degrees of heterogeneity. Even if the variance of the strong transmissivity field can be considered high for the application of the perturbative approach, the results show the same order of approximation of the non-linear methods proposed in literature. The procedure allows to compute the posterior probability distribution of the target quantities and to quantify the uncertainty in the model prediction. Bayesian updating has advantages related both to the Monte-Carlo (MC) and non-MC approaches. In fact, as the MC methods, Bayesian updating allows computing the direct posterior probability distribution of the target quantities and as non-MC methods it has computational times in the order of seconds.

AB This study explores the feasibility of identifying the effective soil hydraulic parameterization of a layered soil profile by using a conventional unsteady drainage experiment leading to field capacity. The flux-based field capacity criterion is attained by subjecting the soil profile to a synthetic drainage process implemented numerically in the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model. The effective hydraulic parameterization is associated to either aggregated or equivalent parameters, the former being determined by the geometrical scaling theory while the latter is obtained through the inverse modeling approach. Outcomes from both these methods depend on information that is sometimes difficult to retrieve at local scale and rather challenging or virtually impossible at larger scales. The only knowledge of topsoil hydraulic properties, for example, as retrieved by a near-surface field campaign or a data assimilation technique, is often exploited as a proxy to determine effective soil hydraulic parameterization at the largest spatial scales. Comparisons of the effective soil hydraulic characterization provided by these three methods are conducted by discussing the implications for their use and accounting for the trade-offs between required input information and model output reliability. To better highlight the epistemic errors associated to the different effective soil hydraulic properties and to provide some more practical guidance, the layered soil profiles are then grouped by using the FAO textural classes. For the moderately heterogeneous soil profiles available, all three approaches guarantee a general good predictability of the actual field capacity values and provide adequate identification of the effective hydraulic parameters. Conversely, worse performances are encountered for the highly variable vertical heterogeneity, especially when resorting to the "topsoil-only'' information. In general, the best performances are guaranteed by the equivalent parameters, which might be considered a reference for comparisons with other techniques. As might be expected, the information content of the soil hydraulic properties pertaining only to the uppermost soil horizon is rather inefficient and also not capable to map out the hydrologic behavior of the real vertical soil heterogeneity since the drainage process is significantly affected by profile layering in almost all cases.

ID DISCHARGES; CHANNELS; PLAIN
AB The Po River, in the last century, has undergone significant altimetrical and planimetrical changes, mostly induced by a progressively increasing human pressure. The extensive protection and regulations works carried out to reduce the risk of flooding, the narrowing of the river for improving the navigation, the local interruption of sediment transport caused by a large mobile barrage built for hydropower purposes and the intense sand mining caused huge alterations of the river morphology. These changes were initially very fast and determined a significant and generalized deepening of the middle water course. In the last few decades, however, the pressure induced by human activities on the river decreased significantly and, consequently, a dynamic equilibrium condition tended to be re-established along most of the reaches, as suggested by topographic surveys spanning a period of about twenty years. The present contribution investigates this equilibrium condition by means of a one-dimensional movable bed model, with reference to a 98 km long reach located between the confluence with the Oglio stream and the gauging section of Pontelagoscuro, for which an up to date stage-discharge relationship is available. Considering steady forcing conditions, we estimate the formative discharge producing the observed river topography and the corresponding sediment transport capacity. The field surveys of cross section geometry used to investigate the possible existence of an equilibrium morphology span a period (1982-2005) of about twenty years. In the presence of fixed banks, the rived bed morphology appears to be controlled by relatively moderate discharges, quite close to the mean yearly discharge and significantly smaller than both the ordinary flood discharge and the maximum annual discharge. Even though significant deviations from equilibrium are produced by the sediment waves triggered by larger floods, deposition occurring during lower stages and the continuous reworking of the bed due to less intense but more frequent discharges implies a tendency of the river to recover its equilibrium profile.

AB Streamflow time series are commonly derived from stage-discharge rating curves, but the uncertainty of the rating curve and resulting streamflow series are poorly understood. While different methods to quantify uncertainty in the stage-discharge relationship exist, there is limited understanding of how uncertainty estimates differ between methods due to different assumptions and methodological choices. We compared uncertainty estimates and stage-discharge rating curves from seven methods at three river locations of varying hydraulic complexity. Comparison of the estimated uncertainties revealed a wide range of estimates, particularly for high and low flows. At the simplest site on the Is&e River (France), full width 95% uncertainties for the different methods ranged from 3 to 17% for median flows. In contrast, uncertainties were much higher and ranged from 41 to 200% for high flows in an extrapolated section of the rating curve at the Mahurangi River (New Zealand) and 28 to 101% for low flows at the Taf River (United Kingdom), where the hydraulic control is unstable at low flows. Differences between methods result from differences in the sources of uncertainty considered, differences in the handling of the time-varying nature of rating curves, differences in the extent of hydraulic knowledge assumed, and differences in assumptions when extrapolating rating curves above or below the observed gaugings. Ultimately, the selection of an uncertainty method requires a match between user requirements and the assumptions made by the uncertainty method. Given the significant differences in uncertainty estimates between methods, we suggest that a clear statement of uncertainty assumptions be presented alongside streamflow uncertainty estimates.
   Plain Language Summary Knowledge of the uncertainty in streamflow discharge measured at gauging stations is important for water management applications and scientific analysis. This paper shows that uncertainty estimates vary widely (typically up to a factor of 4) when comparing seven recently introduced estimation methods. A clear understanding of the assumptions underpinning different uncertainty estimation methods and the sources of uncertainty included in their calculations is needed when selecting a method and using and presenting its uncertainty estimates.

AB Tidal environments are characterized by a complex interplay of hydrological, geomorphic, and biological processes, and their understanding and modeling thus require the explicit description of both their biotic and abiotic components. In particular, the presence and spatial distribution of salt marsh vegetation ( a key factor in the stabilization of the surface soil) have been suggested to be related to topographic factors and to soil moisture patterns, but a general, process-based comprehension of this relationship has not yet been achieved. The present paper describes a finite element model of saturated-unsaturated subsurface flow in a schematic salt marsh, driven by tidal fluctuations and evapotranspiration. The conditions leading to the establishment of preferentially aerated subsurface zones are studied, and inferences regarding the development and spatial distribution of salt marsh vegetation are drawn, with important implications for the overall ecogeomorphological dynamics of tidal environments. Our results show that subsurface water flow in the marsh induces complex water table dynamics, even when the tidal forcing has a simple sinusoidal form. The definition of a space-dependent aeration time is then proposed to characterize root aeration. The model shows that salt marsh subsurface flow depends on the distance from the nearest creek or channel and that the subsurface water movement near tidal creeks is both vertical and horizontal, while farther from creeks, it is primarily vertical. Moreover, the study shows that if the soil saturated conductivity is relatively low (10(-6) m s(-1), values quite common in salt marsh areas), a persistently unsaturated zone is present below the soil surface even after the tide has flooded the marsh; this provides evidence of the presence of an aerated layer allowing a prolonged presence of oxygen for aerobic root respiration. The results further show that plant transpiration increases the extent and persistence of the aerated layer, thereby introducing a strong positive feedback: Pioneer plants on marsh edges have the effect of increasing soil oxygen availability, thus creating the conditions for the further development of other plant communities.

AB Given the structural shortcomings of conceptual rainfall-runoff models and the common use of time-invariant model parameters, these parameters can be expected to represent broader aspects of the rainfall-runoff relationship than merely the static catchment characteristics that they are commonly supposed to quantify. In this article, we relax the common assumption of time-invariance of parameters, and instead seek signature information about the dynamics of model behaviour and performance. We do this by using a temporal clustering approach to identify periods of hydrological similarity, allowing the model parameters to vary over the clusters found in this manner, and calibrating these parameters simultaneously. The diagnostic information inferred from these calibration results, based on the patterns in the parameter sets of the various clusters, is used to enhance the model structure. This approach shows how diagnostic model evaluation can be used to combine information from the data and the functioning of the hydrological model in a useful manner.

AB In order to evaluate the relationship between the apparent complexity of hillslope soil moisture and the emergent patterns of catchment hydrological behaviour and water quality, we need fine-resolution catchment-wide data on soil moisture characteristics. This study proposes a methodology whereby vegetation patterns obtained from high-resolution orthorectified aerial photographs are used as an indicator of soil moisture characteristics. This enables us to examine a set of hypotheses regarding what drives the spatial patterns of soil moisture at the catchment scale (material properties or topography). We find that the pattern of Juncus effusus vegetation is controlled largely by topography and mediated by the catchment's material properties. Characterizing topography using the topographic index adds value to the soil moisture predictions relative to slope or upslope contributing area (UCA). However, these predictions depart from the observed soil moisture patterns at very steep slopes or low UCAs. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Direct-push based hydraulic profiling tool (HPT) and geostatistically-based hydraulic tomography (HT) are two promising techniques for the high-resolution estimation of hydraulic conductivity (K) for unconsolidated sedi-ments. Although HPT surveys could be conducted rapidly, relating the 1.5-cm resolution injection logging profiles to K always involve the upscaling of centimeter-scale measurements to coarser intervals for the devel-opment of site-specific formulae. On the other hand, K fields reconstructed by HT could be smooth when pumping test data are sparse. In this study, an inverse modeling approach was firstly utilized to estimate K values directly from HPT survey data for the glaciofluvial deposits at the North Campus Research Site (NCRS) in Wa-terloo, Ontario, Canada. A site-specific power-law relationship was generated for the NCRS to relate HPT profiles to the vertical distributions of K. Then, the proposed inverse modeling approach was evaluated with a two-dimensional synthetic aquifer under controlled conditions, and the estimated K profiles from inverse analysis of synthetic HPT surveys were incorporated into the steady-state HT. Results of the field study showed that K estimates from the developed formula corresponded better with K values from permeameter tests, than those estimated from the empirical model of McCall and Christy (2010) for HPT surveys. Moreover, through synthetic experiments, we demonstrated that integration of K values inverted from HPT into steady-state HT analyses yielded K tomograms that were significantly better than the geostatistical inversion results relying on pumping test data alone. Overall, this study highlights the need in developing site-specific formulae for the HPT and the joint implementation of HPT and HT techniques for the more cost-effective high-resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity.

ID NETWORK
AB We present a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) capable of reproducing simultaneously the aggregated behavior of changes in water storage in the hillslope surface, the unsaturated and the saturated soil layers and the channel that drains the hillslope. The system of equations can be viewed as a two-state integral-balance model for soil moisture and groundwater dynamics. Development of the model was motivated by the need for landscape representation through hillslopes and channels organized following stream drainage network topology. Such a representation, with the basic discretization unit of a hillslope, allows ODEs-based simulation of the water transport in a basin. This, in turn, admits the use of highly efficient numerical solvers that enable space-time scaling studies. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether a nonlinear ODE system can effectively replicate observations of water storage in the unsaturated and saturated layers of the soil. Our first finding is that a previously proposed ODE hillslope model, based on readily available data, is capable of reproducing streamflow fluctuations but fails to reproduce the interactions between the surface and subsurface components at the hillslope scale. However, the more complex ODE model that we present in this paper achieves this goal. In our model, fluxes in the soil are described using a Taylor expansion of the underlying storage flux relationship. We tested the model using data collected in the Shale Hills watershed, a 7.9-ha forested site in central Pennsylvania, during an artificial drainage experiment in August 1974 where soil moisture in the unsaturated zone, groundwater dynamics and surface runoff were monitored. The ODE model can be used as an alternative to spatially explicit hillslope models, based on systems of partial differential equations, which require more computational power to resolve fluxes at the hillslope scale. Therefore, it is appropriate to be coupled to runoff routing models to investigate the effect of runoff and its uncertainty propagation across scales. However, this improved performance comes at the expense of introducing two additional parameters that have no obvious physical interpretation. We discuss the implications of this for hydrologic studies across scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Three-parameter bed load rating curves for fractional and total bed load transport rates are presented for 15 bed load data sets, and the relationships between the parameter values and physical attributes of the transport process are investigated. The coefficients in these rating curves represent the product of the bed load particle size raised to a power near 1.5 and the active channel width divided by the threshold for bed load entrainment raised to the power of the bed load rating curve exponent. Because bed load entrainment thresholds for different streams typically increase with stream scale faster than do mean bed load particle sizes, total bed load rating curves coefficients for different streams decrease with increasing stream size. In the case of fractional bed load, however, differences between the entrainment thresholds for different particle size fractions are relatively small, so coefficients in fractional bed load rating curves for a given stream usually increase with the particle size class considered. Much of the variability in bed load rating curve exponents appears to be due to estimation errors rather than physical conditions in the stream. The exponents can be overestimated when the sample data used to estimate them are confined to discharges near the sediment entrainment threshold, and the mathematical consequences of summing multiple fractional rating curves can inflate the exponents for mixed size sediments. We recognize channel geometry as another important factor determining the value of rating curve exponents, but the detailed topographic data needed to assess the role of channel form is unavailable for the most of the sampling locations analyzed in this study.
   Plain Language Summary Bed load rating curves are equations used to estimate that flux of coarse sediment during high-flow events in streams. The rating curve equations are optimized to match measured sediment transport rates using statistical techniques to vary the values of adjustable variables, called parameters. Currently, the parameters cannot be predicted from the physical attributes of the stream, or adjusted to account for observed changes in stream condition. We compare rating curves parameters to stream attributes for 15 different bed load data sets and determine how the parameters are related to stream scale and the size of sediment in transport.

TI Modelling overland flow based on Saint-Venant equations for a

SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES

ID PLANE
AB Mathematical modelling of overland flow is a critical task in simulating transport of water, sediment and other pollutants from land surfaces to receiving waters. In this paper, an overland flow routing method is developed based on the Saint-Venant equations using a discretized hillslope system for areas with high roughness and steep slope. Under these conditions, the momentum equation reduces to a unique relationship between the flow depth and discharge. A hillslope is treated as a system divided into several subplanes. A set of first-order non-linear differential equations for subsequent subplanes are solved analytically using Chezy's formula in lieu of the momentum equation. Comparison of the analytical solution of the first-order non-linear ordinary differential equations and a numerical solution using the Runge-Kutta method shows a relative error of 0.3%. Using runoff data reported in the literature, comparison between the new approach and a numerical solution of the full Saint-Venant equations showed a close agreement.

AB Synthetic design storms are often used to plan new drainage systems or assess flood impacts on infrastructure. To simulate extreme rainfall events under climate change, design storms can be modified to match a different return frequency of extreme rainfall events as well as a modified temporal distribution of rainfall intensities. However, the same magnitude of change to the rainfall intensities is often applied in space. Several hydrological applications are limited by this. Climate change impacts on urban pluvial floods, for example, require the use of 2D design storms (rainfall fields) at sub-kilometer and sub-hourly scales. Recent kilometer scale climate models, also known as convection-permitting climate models (CPM), provide rainfall outputs at a high spatial resolution, although rainfall simulations are still restricted to a limited number of climate scenarios and time periods. We nevertheless explored the potential use of rainfall data obtained from these models for hydrological flood impact studies by introducing a method of spatial quantile mapping (SQM). To demonstrate the new methodology, we extracted high-resolution rainfall simulations from a CPM for four domains representing different urban areas in Switzerland. Extreme storms that are plausible under the present climate conditions were simulated with a 2D stochastic rainfall model. Based on the CPM-informed stochastically generated rainfall fields, we modified the design storms to fit the future climate scenario using three different methods: the SQM, a uniform quantile mapping, and a uniform adjustment based on a rainfall-temperature relationship. Throughout all storms, the temporal distribution of rainfall was the same. Using a flood model, we assessed the impact of different rainfall adjustment methods on urban flooding. Significant differences were found in the flood water depths and areas between the three methods. In general, the SQM method results in a higher flood impact than the storms that were modified otherwise. The results suggest that spatial storm profiles may need to be re-adjusted when assessing flood impacts.

AB CO2 injection and storage in deep saline aquifers involves many coupled processes, including multiphase flow, heat and mass transport, rock deformation and mineral precipitation and dissolution. Coupling is especially critical in carbonate aquifers, where minerals will tend to dissolve in response to the dissolution of CO2 into the brine. The resulting neutralization will drive further dissolution of both CO2 and calcite. This suggests that large cavities may be formed and that proper simulation may require full coupling of reactive transport and multiphase flow. We show that solving the latter may suffice whenever two requirements are met: (1) all reactions can be assumed to occur in equilibrium and (2) the chemical system can be calculated as a function of the state variables of the multiphase flow model (i.e., liquid and gas pressure, and temperature). We redefine the components of multiphase flow codes (traditionally, water and CO2), so that they are conservative for all reactions of the chemical system. This requires modifying the traditional constitutive relationships of the multiphase flow codes, but yields the concentrations of all species and all reaction rates by simply performing speciation and mass balance calculations at the end of each time step. We applied this method to the H2O-CO2-Na-Cl-CaCO3 system, so as to model CO2 injection into a carbonate aquifer containing brine. Results were very similar to those obtained with traditional formulations, which implies that full coupling of reactive transport and multi-phase flow is not really needed for this kind of systems, but the resulting simplifications may make it advisable even for cases where the above requirements are not met. Regarding the behavior of carbonate rocks, we find that porosity development near the injection well is small because of the low solubility of calcite. Moreover, dissolution concentrates at the front of the advancing CO2 plume because the brine below the plume tends to reach high CO2 concentrations quite rapidly. We conclude that carbonate dissolution needs not to be feared. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NON-DARCY FLOW; POROUS-MEDIA; SIMULATION
AB In addition to intrinsic matrix pores, ranging in size from submicrons to microns, vuggy carbonates often contain significantly larger vug spaces. Immiscible multiphase fluids flowing through this type of microporous systems exhibit complicated flow mechanisms that are involved in the interactions between multiphase fluids and different types of pore spaces. Modeling multiphase fluid flows requires using the appropriate governing equations for different porosity systems. More specifically, while multiphase Darcy's equations might hold for a matrix system, they are not applicable for a vug system. To improve understanding this difficult multiphase flow problem in vuggy carbonates, we developed a unified grayscale lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for multiphase flows. The proposed model combines the generalized LB model in porous media with the pseudo-potential multiphase approach by adding the fluid-fluid interaction force, the fluid-solid interaction force, and the linear and nonlinear drag forces induced by the porous matrix. The model is still within the framework of the generalized LB model, and it switches freely from the Darcy's regime to the free-flow regime via rock property (i.e., porosity). It can also extend to a wide range of porosity systems because we incorporated both the linear and nonlinear drag effects. A continuous flow interface between the porous matrix and the vug region is captured by simulation without incorporating complex interface boundary conditions between the two porosity systems. The current model is validated and calibrated with theory, and then it is applied to a number of test cases. The test cases include the simulations of two-phase displacement in non-vuggy porous media, isolated vuggy porous media, and connected vuggy (fractured) porous media. Moreover, the effect of vug spaces on the interface-front speed and the breakthrough time is investigated. In addition, we simulated water displacing oil in two real vuggy carbonate cores imaged using low-resolution and high-resolution X-ray computed microtomography, and we investigated the effects of matrix heterogeneity, vug connectivity, and matrix wetting preference.

AB The macroscopic porous medium equations for mass, momentum, and energy transport for air, water, and solid phases and the interfaces between these phases are examined in light of the second law of thermodynamics.  Attention is focused on the momentum balance for the water phase.  Appropriate forms of the momentum balance are obtained, in general, for the slow flow situation and for the case when the water phase completely wets the solid.  This last case suggests that the relative wettability of the water and air phases is an important dependent thermodynamic variable which contributes to the hysteretic nature of the capillary pressure versus saturation curve.

AB [1] Large simulation models of eutrophication processes are commonly used to aid scientific understanding and to guide management decisions. Confidence in models for these purposes depends on uncertainty in model equations (structural uncertainty) and on effects of input uncertainties (model parameters, initial conditions, and forcing functions) on model outputs. Our objective herein is to illustrate two strategies, a generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) approach combined with a simple Monte Carlo sampling scheme and a Bayesian methodological framework along with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, for elucidating the propagation of uncertainty in the high-dimensional parameter spaces of mechanistic eutrophication models. We examine the ability of the two approaches to offer insights into the degree of information about model inputs that the data contain, to quantify the correlation structure among parameter estimates, and to obtain predictions along with uncertainty bounds for modeled output variables. Our analysis is based on a four-state-variable (phosphate-detritus-phytoplankton-zooplankton) model and the mesotrophic Lake Washington (Washington State, United States) as a case study. Scientific knowledge, expert judgment, and observational data were used to formulate prior probability distributions and characterize the uncertainty pertaining to 14 model parameters. Despite the conceptual differences for addressing model equifinality, that is, wide ranges of parameter values subject to complex multivariate relationships that result in plausible observed behaviors and produce equivalently accurate predictions, we found that the two strategies provided fairly consistent estimates of the posterior parameter correlation structure and output uncertainty. Nonetheless, our analysis also shows that MCMC can more efficiently quantify the joint probability distribution of model parameters and make inference about this distribution. The latter finding can be explained by the basic idea underlying the MCMC methodology, that is, the configuration of a Markov process whose stationary distribution approximates the joint posterior distribution of all the stochastic model nodes; as a result, Monte Carlo samples are not drawn from the prior parameter space, and problems of wide or highly correlated prior distributions can be overcome. Finally, our study stresses the lack of perfect simulators of natural system dynamics and introduces two statistical formulations that can explicitly account for the discrepancy between mathematical models and environmental systems.

AB Snow depth measurements have been taken since 1986 at 106 snow poles distributed in the Spanish Pyrenees. Here, we compared the capacity of several local, geostatistical and global interpolator methods for mapping the spatial distribution of averaged snowpack (1986-2000) and the snowpack distribution in two single years With different climatic conditions. The error estimators indicate that the terrain complexity of the area makes it difficult to apply local and geostatistical methods satisfactorily. Regression-tree models provide an accurate description of the data set used (the calibration phase), but they show a relatively low predictive capability for the study case (the validation phase). Using linear regression and generalized additive models (GAMs). we achieved more robust estimations than by means of a regression-tree model. The GAMs give the most accurate prediction because they consider the non-linear relationships between snowpack and the external characteristics (physical features) of the sampling points.

Two objective functions and three cases having different constraint conditions are used to achieve nondominated solutions. NSGA-II effectively determines these solutions without being subject to any user-defined penalty function, as it is applied to a multireservoir system optimization having a number of constraints (here, 246), multi-objectives, and infeasible initial solutions. Most research by multi-objective genetic algorithms only reveals a trade-off in the objective function space present, and thus the decision maker must reanalyse this trade-off relationship in order to obtain information on the decision variable. Contrastingly, this study suggests a method for identifying the best solutions among the nondominated ones by analysing the relation between objective function values and decision variables. Our conclusions demonstrated that NSGA-II performs well in multireservoir system optimization having multi-objectives. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We consider non-linear Bayesian inversion problems targeting the geostatistical hyperparameters of a random field describing hydrogeological or geophysical properties given hydrogeological or geophysical data. This problem is of particular importance in the non-ergodic setting as there are no analytical upscaling relationships linking the data to the hyperparameters, such as, mean, standard deviation, and integral scales. Full inversion of the hyperparameters and the local properties of the field (typically involving many thousands of unknowns) brings substantial computational challenges, such that simplifying model assumptions (e.g., homogeneity or ergodicity) are typically made. To prevent the errors resulting from such simplified assumptions while also circumventing the burden of high-dimensional full inversions, we use a pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that treats the random field as latent variables. In this random effects model, the intractable likelihood of observing the data given the hyperparameters is estimated by Monte Carlo averaging over realizations of the random field. To increase the efficiency of the method, low-variance approximations of the likelihood ratio are obtained by using importance sampling and by correlating the samples used in the proposed and current steps of the Markov chain. We assess the performance of this correlated pseudo-marginal method by considering two representative inversion problems involving diffusion-based and wave-based physics, respectively, in which we infer the hyperparameters of (1) hydraulic conductivity fields using apparent hydraulic conductivity data in a data-poor setting and (2) fracture aperture fields using borehole ground -penetrating radar (GPR) reflection data in a more data-rich setting. For the first test case, we find that the correlated pseudo-marginal method generates similar estimates of the geostatistical mean as classical rejection sampling, while an inversion assuming ergodicity provides biased estimates. For the second test case, we find that the correlated pseudo-marginal method estimates the hyperparameters well, while rejection sampling is computationally unfeasible and a simplified model assuming homogeneity leads to biased estimates.

AB The multiscale nature of geological formations is reflected in the flow and transport behaviors of the pore fluids. For example, multiple pathways between different locations in the porous medium are usually present. The topology, length, and strength of these flow paths can vary significantly, and the total flow at a given location can be the result of contributions from a wide range of pathways between the points of interest. We use a high-resolution pore network of a natural porous formation as an example of the multiscale connectivity of the pore space. A single continuum model can capture the contributions from all the flow paths properly only if the control volume (computational cell) is much larger than the longest pathway. However, depending on the densities and lengths of these long pathways, choosing the appropriate size of the control volume that allows for a single continuum description of the properties, such as conductivity and transmissibility, may conflict with the desire to resolve the flow field properly. To capture the effects of the multiscale pathways on the flow, a non-local continuum model is described. The model can represent non-local effects, for which Darcy's law is not valid. In the limit where the longest connections are much smaller than the size of the control volume, the model is consistent with Darcy's law. The non-local model is used to describe the flow in complex pore networks. The pressure distributions obtained from the non-local model are compared with pore-network flow simulations, and the results are in excellent agreement. Importantly, such multiscale flow behaviors cannot be represented using the local Darcy law. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SPATIAL VARIABILITY; CATCHMENT; SOIL
AB Numerous investigations using various techniques have been carried out towards a more detailed understanding of relationships and interactions between catchment morphometry and rainfall-runoff processes. Recently, this research question has become more relevant through the need for accurate, yet simple, computer models simulating the water balance of large areas. Moreover, advances in the analysis of landform morphometry through the availability of high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and powerful geographical information systems (GIS) have enhanced research efforts with this aim.
   In this study several computer techniques and models were applied to investigate the effects of geomorphometry on rainfall-runoff processes at different scales. The sensitivity of dynamic hydrological processes to comparatively static boundary conditions requires different methods for modelling, analysis and visualization of different kinds of data appropriate to different scales. Therefore an approach integrating several geocomputational concepts, including spatial analysis of different types of geodata, static modelling of spatial structures, dynamic four-dimensional modelling of hydrological processes and statistical techniques was chosen.
   Geomorphometric analysis of the study sites was carried out with GIS packages (including ARC/INFO and GRASS), special purpose software and self-developed tools. Soil-morphometry relationships were modelled within a GIS environment. Hydrological models (SAKE and TOPMODEL) were then used to simulate rainfall-runoff processes, and finally statistical tools and sensitivity analysis were applied to gain an insight into the hydrological significance of the various geomorphometric properties.
   The results demonstrate the importance of small subregions of the catchment, particularly those having low slope angles, low flow lengths and concavities. The spatial distribution of soil types significantly influences modelled runoff. Spatial distributions of soil types are partly related to morphometry and can be captured using soil-morphometry models. Further results show that catchments which differ significantly in morphometry show different runoff responses and different hydrological sensitivity to changes in boundary conditions. A crude derivation of geomorphometric-hydrological landform types could be reached. Therefore, geomorphometric classifications of catchment types could form a basis for representative hydrological modelling at the large scale. Models describing soil distribution in relation to geomorphometry could assist regionalization of spatial heterogeneity and structure of soil parameters relevant in hydrological modelling. Moreover, quantification of geomorphometric catchment structure, e.g. in terms of contributing areas, is needed to describe significant geomorphometric catchment characteristics.

AB Parameters in a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution are specified as a function of covariates using a conditional density network (CDN), which is a probabilistic extension of the multilayer perceptron neural network. If the covariate is time or is dependent on time, then the GEV-CDN model can be used to perform nonlinear, nonstationary GEV analysis of hydrological or climatological time series. Owing to the flexibility of the neural network architecture, the model is capable of representing a wide range of nonstationary relationships. Model parameters are estimated by generalized maximum likelihood, an approach that is tailored to the estimation of GEV parameters from geophysical time series. Model complexity is identified using the Bayesian information criterion and the Akaike information criterion with small sample size correction. Monte Carlo simulations are used to validate GEV-CDN performance on four simple synthetic problems. The model is then demonstrated on precipitation data from southern California, a series that exhibits nonstationarity due to interannual/interdecadal climatic variability.

AB Rainfall erosivity is defined as the potential of the rain to cause erosion, and it can be represented by rainfall kinetic power. At first in this paper, the raindrop size distributions (DSD) measured by an optical disdrometer located at Palermo in the period June 2006-March 2014 and aggregated for intensity classes, are presented. Then an analysis of raindrop size characteristics is carried out, and the reliability of Ulbrich's distribution, using both the maximum likelihood and momentum estimate parameter methods, is tested. The raindrop size measurements are used to determine the experimental rainfall kinetic power values, which are compared with the ones calculated by a theoretically deduced relationship. This analysis demonstrates that the kinetic power is strictly related to the median volume diameter of DSD. Finally, the reliability of the simplest Marshall and Palmer exponential DSD for estimating the rainfall kinetic power is demonstrated. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The evaluation of extreme snowfalls is an important challenge for hazard management in mountainous regions. In this paper, the extreme snowfall data acquired from 40 meteorological stations in the French Alps since 1966 are analyzed using spatial extreme statistics. They are then modeled within the formal framework of max-stable processes (MSPs) which are the generalization of the univariate extreme value theory to the spatial multivariate case. The three main MSPs now available are compared using composite likelihood maximization, and the most flexible Brown-Resnick one is retained on the basis of the Takeuchi information criterion, taking into account anisotropy by space transformation. Furthermore, different models with smooth trends (linear and splines) for the spatial evolution of the generalized extreme value (GEV) parameters are tested to allow snowfall maps for different return periods to be produced. After altitudinal correction that separates spatial and orographic effects, the different spatial models are fitted to the data within the max-stable framework, allowing inference of the GEV margins and the extremal dependence simultaneously. Finally, a nested model selection procedure is employed to select the best linear and spline models. Results show that the best linear model produces reasonable quantile maps (assessed by cross-validation using other stations), but it is outperformed by the best spline model which better captures the complex evolution of GEV parameters with space. For a given return period and at fixed elevation of 2000 m, extreme 3 day snowfalls are higher in the NE and SE of the French Alps. Maxima of the location parameter of the GEV margins are located in the north and south, while maxima of the scale parameter are located in the SE which corresponds to the Mediterranean influence that tends to bring more variability. Besides, the dependence of extreme snowfalls is shown to be stronger on the local orientation of the Alps, an important result for meteorological variables confirming previous studies. Computations are performed for different accumulation durations which enable obtaining magnitude-frequency curves and show that the intensity of the extremal directional dependence effect is all the more important when the duration is short. Finally, we show how the fitted model can be used to evaluate joint exceedence probabilities and conditional return level maps, which can be useful for operational risk management.

AB Heating any soil during a sufficiently intense wildfire or prescribed burn can alter it irreversibly, causing many significant, long-term biological, chemical, and hydrological effects. Given the climate-change-driven increasing probability of wildfires and the increasing use of prescribed burns by land managers, it is important to better understand the dynamics of the coupled heat and moisture transport in soil during these extreme heating events. Furthermore, improved understanding and modeling of heat and mass transport during extreme conditions should provide insights into the associated transport mechanisms under more normal conditions. The present study describes a numerical model developed to simulate soil heat and moisture transport during fires where the surface heating often ranges between 10,000 and 100,000 W m(-2) for several minutes to several hours. Basically, the model extends methods commonly used to model coupled heat flow and moisture evaporation at ambient conditions into regions of extreme dryness and heat. But it also incorporates some infrequently used formulations for temperature dependencies of the soil specific heat, thermal conductivity, and the water retention curve, as well as advective effects due to the large changes in volume that occur when liquid water is rapidly volatilized. Model performance is tested against laboratory measurements of soil temperature and moisture changes at several depths during controlled heating events. Qualitatively, the model agrees with the laboratory observations, namely, it simulates an increase in soil moisture ahead of the drying front (due to the condensation of evaporated soil water at the front) and a hiatus in the soil temperature rise during the strongly evaporative stage of the soil drying. Nevertheless, it is shown that the model is incapable of producing a physically realistic solution because it does not (and, in fact, cannot) represent the relationship between soil water potential and soil moisture at extremely low soil moisture contents (i. e., residual or bound water: theta < 0.01 m(3) m(-3), for example). Diagnosing the model's performance yields important insights into how to make progress on modeling soil evaporation and heating under conditions of high temperatures and very low soil moisture content.

AB The objective of this study is to derive the stage-discharge relationship for 21 "virtual gauge stations" located at the upper Negro River (Amazon Basin, Brazil). A virtual station can be defined as any crossing of water body surface (i.e., large rivers) by radar altimeter satellite tracks. Rating curve parameters are estimated by fitting with a power law the temporal series of water surface attitude derived from satellite measurements and the discharge. Discharges are calculated using ProGUM, a flow routing model based on the Muskingum-Cunge (M-C) approach considering a diffusion-cum-dynamic wave propagation [Leon, J.G., Bonnet, M.P., Cauhope, M., Calmant, S., Seyler, F., submitted for publication. Distributed water flow estimates of the upper Negro River using a Muskingum-Cunge routing model based on altimetric spatial data. J. Hydrol.]. Among these parameters is the height of effective zero flow. Measured from the WGS84 ellipsoid used as reference, it is shown that the height of effective zero flow is a good proxy of the mean water depth from which bottom slope of the reaches can be computed and Manning roughness coefficients can be evaluated. Mean absolute difference lower than 1.1 m between estimated equivalent water depth and measured water depth indicates the good reliability of the method employed. We computed the free surface water slope from ENVISAT altimetry data for dry and rainy seasons. These profiles are in good agreement with the bottom profile derived from the aforementioned water depths. Also, the corresponding Manning coefficients are consistent-with the admitted ranges for natural channels with important flows (superficial width > 30.5 m [Chow, V.T., 1959. Open Channel Hydraulics. McGraw-Hill, New York]) and irregular section. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   DERIVATION; BASEFLOW; FLOW
AB The long-term flow recession of many springs can be approximated by an exponential function. However, the early recession often exhibits a different behaviour. The exponential recession function represents a long-term approximation of analytical solutions of the flow equation of fissured matrix blocks draining toward a fixed-head boundary. Thus, early deviations from the exponential behaviour potentially originate from the inappropriateness of this approximation at short times. We therefore examine the properties of the exact analytical solutions and make comparisons with field data. If hydraulic heads are initially constant within the matrix blocks the flow recession exhibits a power-law decrease at short times. Both from steady-state initial conditions and after finite recharge pulses the early flow recession follows a power law, too, if discharge is appropriately shifted and rescaled. If the catchment is composed of multiple blocks drained by highly conductive conduits the recession behaviour of the spring is identical to that of the individual blocks if the blocks are of the same size. The recession curves of the published hydrograph of Cheddar spring (Great Britain) are found to be in good agreement with this model if reasonable initial conditions are assumed. A brief look at recession curves from other springs suggests that the model might be applicable to most of them, too. The model also provides satisfactory fits to the flow recession of the Gallusquelle (Germany). However, the observed power-law exponent differs from that predicted by the analytical model. A consistent interpretation of the shape of several recession curves from this spring is provided by a more general fractal approach, which assumes that the catchment is composed of blocks of strongly different sizes.

ID COEFFICIENT; TRANSPORT; STREAMS; MODEL
AB The longitudinal dispersion coefficient (D) is an important parameter needed to describe the transport of solutes in rivers and streams. The dispersion coefficient is generally estimated from tracer studies but the method can be expensive and time consuming, especially for large rivers. A number of empirical relations are available to estimate the dispersion coefficient; however, these relations are known to produce estimates within an order of magnitude of the tracer value. The focus of this paper is on using the shear-flow dispersion theory to directly estimate the dispersion coefficient from velocity measurements obtained using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Using tracer and hydrodynamic data collected within the same river reaches, we examined conditions under which the ADCP and tracer methods produced similar results. Since dead zones / transient storage (TS) are known to influence the dispersion coefficient, we assessed the relative importance of dead zones in different stream reaches using two tracer-based approaches: (1) TS modeling which explicitly accounts for dead zones and (2) the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) which does not have separate terms for dead zones. Dispersion coefficients based on the ADE tend to be relatively high as they describe some of the effects of dead zones as well. Results based on the ADCP method were found to be in good agreement with the ADE estimates indicating that storage zones play an important role in the estimated dispersion coefficients, especially at high flows. For the river sites examined in this paper, the tracer estimates of dispersion were close to the median values of the ADCP estimates obtained from multiple datasets within a reach. The ADCP method appears to be an excellent alternative to the traditional tracer-based method if care is taken to avoid spurious data and multiple datasets are used to compute a distance-weighted average or other appropriate measure that represents reach-averaged conditions.

AB Hydrologic models are often tasked with replicating historical hydrographs but may do so without accurately reproducing the internal hydrological functioning of the watershed, including the flow partitioning, which is critical for predicting solute movement through the catchment. Here we propose a novel partitioning-focused calibration technique that utilizes flow-partitioning coefficients developed based on the pioneering work of L'vovich (1979). Our hypothesis is that inclusion of the L'vovich partitioning relations in calibration increases model consistency and parameter identifiability and leads to superior model performance with respect to flow partitioning than using traditional hydrological signatures (e.g., flow duration curve indices) alone. The L'vovich approach partitions the annual precipitation into four components (quick flow, soil wetting, slow flow, and evapotranspiration) and has been shown to work across a range of climatic and landscape settings. A new diagnostic multicriteria model calibration methodology is proposed that first quantifies four calibration measures for watershed functions based on the L'vovich theory, and then utilizes them as calibration criteria. The proposed approach is compared with a traditional hydrologic signature-based calibration for two conceptual bucket models. Results reveal that the proposed approach not only improves flow partitioning in the model compared to signature-based calibration but is also capable of diagnosing flow-partitioning inaccuracy and suggesting relevant model improvements. Furthermore, the proposed partitioning-based calibration approach is shown to increase parameter identifiability. This model calibration approach can be readily applied to other models.
   Plain Language Summary Hydrologic models are often tasked with replicating historical hydrographs but may do so without accurately reproducing the internal hydrological functioning of the watershed, including the flow partitioning between low and high flows, which is critical for predicting solute movement through the catchment. Here we propose a novel model calibration framework that utilizes an empirical understanding about flow partitioning developed by L'vovich (1979) to constrain the outcomes of watershed models. Our hypothesis is that this approach increases model consistency leads to superior model performance. This method is also capable of diagnosing model structural errors (in flow partitioning) and suggesting relevant model improvements. Overall, this work is a step toward getting the right answer from hydrologic model for the right reasons.

AB We present a runoff reconstruction for the Bailong River based on the composite chronology developed from four sampling sites of Pinus tabulaeformis in the China north-south transition zone. The runoff reconstruction, spanning 1601-2013 CE, was developed by calibrating tree-ring data with the instrumental runoff record. Runoff reconstruction accounted for 44.3% of the actual runoff variance during the common period 1958-2010 and provided a long-term perspective on hydrological change in the China north-south transition zone. In the past 413 years, high- and low-runoff years accounted for 15.50% and 15.98%, respectively. Of all the 17 extreme hydrological events, 14 of them are extremely high-flow years, and 17th century was the wettest period during the past 413 years. The preliminary analysis results show that there is a relationship between our runoff reconstruction and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation at multidecadal scale. Since the 1990s, runoff in the China north-south transition zone has also seen a significant decrease as a result of dry trends of the source region.

AB [1] A field-scale bacterial transport experiment was conducted at the Narrow Channel Focus Area of the South Oyster field site located in Oyster, Virginia. The goal of the field experiment was to determine the relative influence of subsurface heterogeneity and microbial population parameters on flow direction, velocity, and attachment of bacteria at the field scale. The field results were compared with results from laboratory-scale column experiments to develop a method for predicting field-scale bacterial transport. The field site is a shallow, sandy, unconfined, aerobic aquifer that has been characterized by geophysical, sedimentological, and hydrogeological methods. Comamonas sp. strain DA001 and a conservative tracer, bromide (Br), were injected into an area of high permeability for 12 hours. The Br and bacterial concentrations in the groundwater were monitored for 1 week at 192 sampling ports spaced over a 2-m vertical zone located from 0.5 to 7 m down-gradient of the injection well. The bacterial and Br plume was observed to move past 95 sampling ports. The densely characterized field site enabled the comparison of variations in DA001 transport to the aquifer properties. The velocity of the injected plume was correlated with geophysical estimates of hydraulic conductivity. The bacterial and Br plume appeared to follow flow paths not coincident with the hydraulic gradient but through a zone of higher permeability located off the flow axis. The amount of breakthrough of the bacteria was similar in both the high and low permeability layers with only a weak correlation between the observed hydraulic conductivity and amount of bacterial breakthrough. The uniformity in the observed attachment rates across varying grain sizes could be explained by heterogeneity of microbial properties within the single strain of injected bacteria. Application of colloid filtration theory to the field data indicated that variations in the microbial population were described by a lognormal distribution of the collision efficiency (alpha). Core-scale studies were used to predict the alpha distribution and field-scale transport distances of DA001. In sandy aquifers, physical heterogeneity may play a secondary role in controlling field-scale bacterial transport, and future research should focus on the microbial factors affecting transport.

   bending effect
ID SYSTEM
AB The Theis equation has been widely used to study the transient movement of groundwater as a result of pumping in a confined aquifer. It is well known that the observed drawdown at early times has an obvious departure from the theoretical drawdown based on the Theis equation. The Theis equation was derived under the assumption that total stress in the aquifer was constant and the mechanical behavior of the confining unit was neglected. However, most geological formations, especially those which are well consolidated, have rigidity and therefore may bend like a plate to a certain extent. The increase in the effective stress in the aquifer due to pumping may not contribute entirely to the compression of the aquifer, but may be partially cancelled out by bending of the overlying aquitard. This means only a part of the total stress is used to compact the aquifer, or the aquifer cannot produce as much water as estimated from the Theis equation. This paper investigated the impact of the bending effect of the confining unit on drawdown. An analytical model which couples flow in the aquifer and bending of the confining unit was presented. The theory is based on elastic plates and solutions were given to the drawdown of groundwater level and deflection of the overlying formation. The drawdown estimated from the new equation was compared with that from the Theis equation. It can be concluded that drawdown from the Theis equation is less than the drawdown predicted by including the bending effect of the confining unit. Both a hypothetical example and a field pumping test in Shandong Province, China, were used to demonstrate the bending effect of the confining unit in the analysis of pumping test data. This paper demonstrated that the initial disagreement between observed drawdown and the Theis solution could be caused by the bending effect of the confining unit, a phenomenon not well addressed in traditional pumping test analysis. A quantitative understanding of this phenomenon can provide improved guidelines for analyzing drawdown data in a confined aquifer. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soils under a wide range of vegetation types exhibit water repellency following the passage of a fire. This is viewed by many as one of the main causes for accelerated post-fire runoff and soil erosion and it has often been assumed that strong soil water repellency present after wildfire is fire-induced. However, high levels of repellency have also been reported under vegetation types not affected by fire, and the question arises to what degree the water repellency observed at burnt sites actually results from fire.
   This study aimed at determining 'natural background' water repellency in common coniferous forest types in the north-western USA. Mature or semi-mature coniferous forest sites (n = 81), which showed no evidence of recent fires and had at least some needle cast cover, were sampled across six states. After careful removal of litter and duff at each site, soil water repellency was examined in situ at the mineral soil surface using the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) method for three sub-sites, followed by collecting near-surface mineral soil layer samples (0-3 cm depth). Following air-drying, samples were further analyzed for repellency using WDPT and contact angle (0(sl)) measurements. Amongst other variables examined were dominant tree type, ground vegetation, litter and duff layer depth, slope angle and aspect, elevation, geology, and soil texture, organic carbon content and pH.
   'Natural background' water repellency (WDPT > 5 s) was detected in situ and on air-dry samples at 75% of all sites examined irrespective of dominant tree species (Pinus ponderosa, Pinus contorta, Picea engelmanii and Pseudotsuga menziesii). These findings demonstrate that the soil water repellency commonly observed in these forest types following burning is not necessarily the result of recent fire but can instead be a natural characteristic. The notion of a low background water repellency being typical for long-unburnt conifer forest soils of the north-western USA is therefore incorrect. It follows that, where pre-fire water repellency levels are not known or highly variable, post-fire soil water repellency conditions are an unreliable indicator in classifying soil burn severity.
   The terrain and soil variables examined showed, overall, no convincing relationship with the repellency levels observed (R-2 < 0.15) except that repellency was limited in soils (i) developed over meta-sedimentary lithology and (ii) with clay contents >4%. This suggests that water repellency levels cannot be predicted with confidence from common terrain or soil variables. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In western North America (WNA), mountain snowpack supplies much of the water used for irrigation, municipal, and industrial uses. Thus, snow droughts (a lack of snow accumulation in winter) can have drastic ecological and socioeconomic impacts. In this study, the historical (1951-2013) frequency, severity, and risk (frequency x severity) of dry, warm, and warm and dry snow droughts are quantified at the grid-cell and ecoregion scale for snow-dominated regions in the western United States and southwestern Canada (sWNA). Based on multiple linear regression analysis, relationships between mean winter temperature, snow drought risk, and snow water equivalent sensitivity are explored. Piecewise linear regression is used to identify temperature thresholds for mapping temperature-related snow drought susceptibility. Results highlight spatial differences in snow drought regimes across sWNA and reveal that temperature thresholds exist at -3.1 degrees C (+/- 0.3 degrees C) and 1.4 degrees C (+/- 0.3 degrees C), above which the warm snow drought risk increases more rapidly. Approximately 3% of the nonglaciated snow storage in this region has high susceptibility to temperature-related snow drought, representing 11 km(3) of water, or approximately one third the capacity of Lake Mead. Under a +2 degrees C climate scenario, an additional 8% (28 km(3)) of this snow storage volume will transition to high susceptibility.
   Plain Language Summary In western North America, mountain snowpack fills reservoirs for agricultural, municipal, and industrial uses and sustains streamflow in summer when ecosystem needs are high. Thus, snow droughts (a lack of snow accumulation in winter) can have large social, economic, and environmental impacts. An analysis of the frequency and severity of past snow droughts shows that warm and dry winter conditions occurring together produce the most severe snow droughts, while warm winter conditions alone produce the least severe snow droughts. The severity and frequency of warm snow droughts, however, is dependent on mean winter temperature, and the risk of warm snow droughts is substantially higher for locations with mean winter temperatures above -3.1 degrees C (+/- 0.3 degrees C). Approximately 3% of the volume of the western United States' and southwestern Canada's nonglaciated snowpack is highly susceptible to warm snow droughts, and an additional 24% exhibits medium susceptibility.

TI Water consumption patterns as a basis for water demand modeling
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Future water demand is a main consideration in water system management. Consequently, water demand models (WDMs) have evolved in past decades, identifying principal demand-generating factors and modeling their influence on water demand. Regional water systems serve consumers of various types (e.g., municipalities, farmers, industrial regions) and consumption patterns. Thus, one of the challenges in regional water demand modeling is the heterogeneity of the consumers served by the water system. When a high-resolution, regional WDM is desired, accounting for this heterogeneity becomes all the more important. This paper presents a novel approach to regional water demand modeling. The two-step approach includes aggregating the data set into groups of consumers having similar consumption characteristics, and developing a WDM for each homogeneous group. The development of WDMs is widely applied in the literature and thus, the focus of this paper is to discuss the first step of data aggregation. The research hypothesis is that water consumption records in their original or transformed form can provide a basis for aggregating the data set into groups of consumers with similar consumption characteristics. This paper presents a methodology for water consumption data clustering by comparing several data representation methods (termed Feature Vectors): monthly normalized average, monthly consumption coefficient of variation, a combination of the monthly average and monthly variation, and the autocorrelation coefficients of the consumption time series. Clustering using solely normalized monthly average provided homogeneous and distinct clusters with respect to monthly consumption, which succeed in capturing different consumer characteristics (water use, geographical location) that were not specified a-priori. Clustering using the monthly coefficient of variation provided different, yet homogeneous clusters, clustering consumers characterized by similar variation trends that were closely related to consumer water use type. The concatenation of these two Feature Vectors provided further insight into the relationship between consumption patterns and variability of consumers. An autocorrelation Feature Vector provided results that can form a basis for constructing a time-series model that is based on a group of resembling time series. The approaches presented here are steps toward utilizing the increasing amount of available water consumption data and data analysis techniques to facilitate the modeling of water demands in larger and heterogeneous regions with sufficient resolution.

AB Soil moisture distribution emerges as a key link between hydrologic and ecologic processes in semiarid grassland and shrubland, as it influences evapotranspiration, respiration, and assimilation. In support, we present three years of data (2002-2004) collected from a semiarid grassland and shrubland within the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge of central New Mexico; the two sites are separated by about 5 km. Instrumentation includes an eddy covariance tower and typical micrometeorological devices at both locations. Additionally, the grassland site features six soil moisture profiles and the shrubland site features four soil moisture profiles, with the maximum depth at 52.5 cm. At both sites, most rain falls during the warm season, but large storms do occur at other times of the year, e. g., spring of 2004. Soil moisture pulses at 2.5 cm follow almost all rain events, whereas only four pulses in the 3-year record are observed at 52.5 cm in the grassland and two in the shrubland; these deeper pulses follow large precipitation events or a series of smaller events. The daily times series of evapotranspiration (ET) is similar between the grassland and shrubland, supporting the results of Kurc and Small (2004). ET variations largely reflect changes in the soil moisture at 2.5 cm. In contrast, though the daily time series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) at both sites covary, the magnitudes of peaks in net negative ecosystem exchange (NEE-) and net positive ecosystem exchange (NEE+) are over twice the magnitude at grassland than at the shrubland. Furthermore, pulses associated with NEE- peaks last much longer than ET pulses, of the order of 1-2 months, without any particular adherence to the climatologically defined rainy season. These NEE- pulses reflect changes in deeper soil moisture, i.e., 52.5 cm at the grassland and 37.5 cm at the shrubland. Finally, evidence of soil moisture driven respiration is found throughout the NEE time series, with spikes of NEE+ following most rain events; however, longer periods of NEE+ also occur during relatively dry periods. Modeled assimilation suggests that the relationship between assimilation and soil moisture is strongest at depths at least 30 cm below the surface.

AB A three-dimensional two-phase flow model is coupled to a non-linear reactive transport model to study the efficacy of potassium permanganate treatment on dense, non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source removal in porous media. A linear relationship between the soil permeability (k) and concentration of manganese dioxide precipitate ([MnO2(s)]), k = k(o) + S-rind [MnO2(s)], is utilized to simulate nodal permeability reductions due to precipitate formation. Using published experimental column studies, an S-rind = -5.5 x 10(-16) m(2) L/mg was determined for trichloroethylene (TCE) DNAPL. This S-rind was then applied to treatment simulations on three-dimensional TCE DNAPL source zones comprising either DNAPL at residual saturations, or DNAPL at pooled saturations.
   DNAPL dissolution without oxidation treatment, simulated using equilibrium and the Nambi and Powers [Nambi I, Powers S. Mass transfer correlations for non-aqueous phase liquid dissolution from regions with high initial saturations. Water Resour Res 2003;39(2): 1-11, SBH 4] mass transfer expression, required 31 and 36 years, respectively, to eliminate the residual source zone. For equilibrium dissolution with continuous treatment and no precipitate influence (S-rind = 0 m(2) L/mg), the residual source zone was removed after 11 years. However, when considering the precipitate influence (i.e., S-rind = - 5.5 x 10(-16) m(2) L/mg), 21 years of treatment were necessary to remove the DNAPL. When considering pulse treatments of 1 and 2 years duration followed by only dissolution, approximately 36 and 38 years, respectively, were required before the source zone was depleted, suggesting that there is no benefit to pulse treatment. Similar trends were observed when allowing 10 years of dissolution prior to treatment initiation. The treatment behaviour of the pooled TCE source, while slightly more efficient than the residual saturation source, was similar.
   Based on simulation findings, the precipitate (rind) formation significantly influences DNAPL treatment with permanganate; the most significant reductions in efficacy were observed for single pulse treatments (of 1 and 2 years), which exhibited times to source depletion similar to the case of dissolution without treatment.

AB Semi-arid riparian woodlands face threats from increasing extractive water demand and climate change in dryland landscapes worldwide. Improved landscape-scale understanding of riparian woodland water use (evapotranspiration, ET) and its sensitivity to climate variables is needed to strategically manage water resources, as well as to create successful ecosystem conservation and restoration plans for potential climate futures. In this work, we assess the spatial and temporal variability of Cottonwood (Populus fremontii)-Willow (Salix gooddingii) riparian gallery woodland ET and its relationships to vegetation structure and climate variables for 80 km of the San Pedro River corridor in southeastern Arizona, USA, between 2014 and 2019. We use a novel combination of publicly available remote sensing, climate and hydrological datasets: cloud-based Landsat thermal remote sensing data products for ET (Google Earth Engine EEFlux), Landsat multispectral imagery and field data-based calibrations to vegetation structure (leaf-area index, LAI), and open-source climate and hydrological data. We show that at landscape scales, daily ET rates (6-10 mm day(-1)) and growing season ET totals (400-1,400 mm) matched rates of published field data, and modelled reach-scale average LAI (0.80-1.70) matched lower ranges of published field data. Over 6 years, the spatial variability of total growing season ET (CV = 0.18) exceeded that of temporal variability (CV = 0.10), indicating the importance of reach-scale vegetation and hydrological conditions for controlling ET dynamics. Responses of ET to climate differed between perennial and intermittent-flow stream reaches. At perennial-flow reaches, ET correlated significantly with temperature, whilst at intermittent-flow sites ET correlated significantly with rainfall and stream discharge. Amongst reaches studied in detail, we found positive but differing logarithmic relationships between LAI and ET. By documenting patterns of high spatial variability of ET at basin scales, these results underscore the importance of accurately accounting for differences in woodland vegetation structure and hydrological conditions for assessing water-use requirements. Results also suggest that the climate sensitivity of ET may be used as a remote indicator of subsurface water resources relative to vegetation demand, and an indicator for informing conservation management priorities.

AB The non-aqueous phase liquid simulator was used to model and interpret the occurrence of a thin benzene-contaminated soil layer 9.0m below the groundwater table in an abandoned gas plant site. The simulator was first evaluated in column tests under similar conditions to the contaminated site. Saturation-capillary pressure (S-P) relationships were extended from the laboratory scale of the column tests to the field scale of the subsurface at the abandoned site. Dynamic boundary conditions were established in order to prevent the model from generating excessive vertical velocities. The modelled benzene layer formation process agreed well with the in situ observations. With falling and then rising of the water table, benzene release from the surface migrated downward and then upward and distributed itself below and above the water table. Biochemical degradation of benzene made the distribution discontinuous in the subsurface. These two factors resulted in the thin benzene-contaminated layer below the groundwater table.

AB The fluid mechanics of elongated bubbles in confined gas-liquid flows in micro-geometries is important in pore-scale flow processes for enhanced oil recovery and mobilization of colloids in unsaturated soil. The efficiency of such processes is traditionally related to the thickness of the liquid film trapped between the elongated bubble and the pore's wall, which is assumed constant. However, the surface of long bubbles presents undulations in the vicinity of the rear meniscus, which may significantly decrease the local thickness of the liquid film, thus impacting the process of interest. This study presents a systematic analysis of these undulations and the minimum film thickness induced in the range Ca = 0.001-0.5 and Re = 0.1-2000. Pore-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed with a self-improved version of the opensource solver ESI OpenFOAM which is based on a Volume of Fluid method to track the gas-liquid interface. A lubrication model based on the extension of the classical axisymmetric Bretherton theory is utilized to better understand the CFD results. The profiles of the rear meniscus of the bubble obtained with the lubrication model agree fairly well with those extracted from the CFD simulations. This study shows that the Weber number of the flow, We = Ca Re, is the parameter that best describes the dynamics of the interfacial waves. When We < 0.1, a single wave crest is observed and the minimum film thickness tends to an asymptotic value, which depends on the capillary number, as We -> 0. Undulations dampen as the capillary number increases and disappear completely when Ca = 0. 5. When We > 0.1, a larger number of wave crests becomes evident on the surface of the rear meniscus of the bubble. The liquid film thickness at the crests of the undulations thins considerably as the Reynolds number is increased, down to less than 60% of the value measured in the flat film region. This may significantly influence important environmental processes, such as the detachment and mobilization of micron-sized pollutants and pathogenic micro-organisms adhering at the pore's wall in unsaturated soil.

AB Solute transport in overland flow is considered as one of the main contributors to water pollution. Although many models of pollutant transport mechanism from soil to run-off water have been proposed, the characteristics of solute transport accompanying the water run-off over vegetated surface have not been well studied. In this study, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to study the solute transport over vegetated surfaces. Based on the experimental results, an idea of the stationary water layer in run-off was proposed. Applying the complete mixing theory in the stationary water layer, an analytical solute transport model was developed with the assumption that the upper run-off completely mixes with the underlying water in the stationary water layer for each site. The results show that the predictions made by the present model are in good agreement with the measured experimental data. For the vegetated surfaces, the depth of stationary water layer is related to the rainfall intensity, bed slope, and vegetation density. The analytical solution shows that the maximum solute transport occurs at the time of concentration. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms of solute transport over vegetated areas.

AB A model of rainfall-runoff relationships is an essential tool in the process of evaluation of water resources projects. In this paper, we applied an artificial neural network (ANN) based model for flow prediction using the data for a catchment in a semi-arid region in Morocco. Use of this method for non-linear modelling has been demonstrated in several scientific fields such as biology, geology, chemistry and physics.
   The performance of the developed neural network-based model was compared against multiple linear regression-based model using the same observed data. It was found that the neural network model consistently gives superior predictions. Based on the results of this study, artificial neural network modelling appears to be a promising technique for the prediction of flow for catchments in semi-arid regions. Accordingly, the neural network method can be applied to various hydrological systems where other models may be inappropriate. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB For effective water quality management and policy development, spatial variability in the mean concentrations and dynamics of riverine water quality needs to be understood. Using water chemistry (calcium, electrical conductivity, nitrate-nitrite, soluble reactive phosphorus, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total suspended solids) data for up to 578 locations across the Australian continent, we assessed the impact of climate zones (arid, Mediterranean, temperate, subtropical, tropical) on (i) inter-annual mean concentration and (ii) water chemistry dynamics as represented by constituent export regimes (ratio of the coefficients of variation of concentration and discharge) and export patterns (slope of the concentration-discharge relationship). We found that inter-annual mean concentrations vary significantly by climate zones and that spatial variability in water chemistry generally exceeds temporal variability. However, export regimes and patterns are generally consistent across climate zones. This suggests that intrinsic properties of individual constituents rather than catchment properties determine export regimes and patterns. The spatially consistent water chemistry dynamics highlights the potential to predict riverine water quality across the Australian continent, which can support national riverine water quality management and policy development.

AB Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a highly accurate and automatable method for determination of porous media water content and electrical conductivity. Water content is inferred from the dielectric permittivity of the medium, whereas electrical conductivity is inferred from TDR signal attenuation. Empirical and dielectric mixing models are used to relate water content to measured dielectric permittivity. Clay and organic matter bind substantial amounts of water, such that measured bulk dielectric constant is reduced and the relationship with total water content requires individual calibration. A variety of TDR probe configurations provide users with site- and media-specific options. Advances in TDR technology and in other dielectric methods offer the promise not only for less expensive and more accurate tools for electrical determination of water and solute contents, but also a host or other properties such as specific surface area, and retention properties of porous media.

AB A conceptual runoff model mathematically expresses hydrological phenomena originating from spatial and temporal changes based on physical laws; thus, it can describe causal relationships for runoff changes. However, these models are difficult to run, owing to their complex structures and the need for a large amount of data. The development of runoff models using deep neural networks (DNN), which belong to the category of empirical models, is continuously increasing owing to the advantages of DNN, such as the modeling convenience and high prediction performance. However, DNN-based runoff models have difficulty reflecting topographical and spatial characteristics, such as land cover and physical soil characteristics, because they mainly depend on meteoro-logical data. The objective of the present study was to overcome the limitation of data use that depends on meteorological data and to reflect topographical characteristics in DNN-based runoff models by suggesting a data creation methodology that reflects spatial characteristics. This paper proposes a methodology for producing two types of two-dimensional features-surface flow features (SFF) and base flow features (BFF)-using the Soil Conservation Service curve number and groundwater level. To determine the applicability of the features, the daily runoff was simulated using the generated features as input data of the convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of DNN. The CNN architecture was improved to have a multi-input structure and derive continuous variables, because the ordinary CNN was difficult to apply in this study. After the CNN was trained, the daily runoff was simulated, and the applicability of the features as input data of the DNN was evaluated. The daily runoff predictions of the CNN using the SFF and BFF exhibited moderate levels. This indicates that the SFF and BFF have sufficient value as input data of the CNN.

AB As an indicator of atmospheric evaporating capability over a hypothetical reference surface, reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is the most important hydrological and meteorological variable to reflect climate change. This is particularly true for the Yellow River Basin, which faces serious water shortages and is vulnerable to climate change. In this study, the ET0 at 80 sites during 1957-2008 in the Yellow River Basin was calculated using the Penman-Monteith method with the calibrated Angstrom coefficients. Spatial and seasonal patterns of changes in ET0 as well as the concerned climatic variables are specially focused on using advanced statistical tests and GIS method. The entire Yellow River Basin is characterized by complicated spatial variability in the change of ET0. Significant negative trends are mainly distributed in the southeast corner, northern side, and midwest of the Yellow River Basin, while significant increases of ET0 mainly occur in the middle part and southwest corner of the basin. Still, no coherent spatial patterns in ET0 trends are seen in any season. The dominance of warming trends in temperature and decreasing trends in wind speed and sunshine duration can be found in the basin. Relative humidity presents insignificant or weak trends at many sites but with a mixed spatial structure of positive and negative trends at both annual and seasonal scales. The combined effects of climatic variables to ET0 changes and their spatial and seasonal variability are revealed by further analysis of sensitivity of ET0 to climatic variables and the contribution of climatic variables to ET0 changes over six homogenous regions identified by a rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) clustering method on annual and seasonal scales. The decline of surface wind speed offsets the increasing effect of the temperature increase and is mainly responsible for the ET0 reduction in the west and north of the Loess Plateau. The reduced sunshine duration is the leading factor for ET0 decrease in the middle-lower Yellow River Plain, especially during the summer time. The increasing mean temperature plays the most important role in the ET0 increase in the source area of the Yellow River Basin. Furthermore, regional actual evapotranspiration and ET0 present complementary behavior, but does not accurately fall in the 1: 1 complementary relationship of the Bouchet's hypothesis, especially for the high elevation subregions. In addition, although precipitation changes are the main driving factors for drought variation, increasing ET0 intensified the drought in middle regions.

AB The partitioning of volatile non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) compounds to a discontinuous gas phase can result in the expansion of that gas phase, and the resulting gas flow can significantly affect the mass transfer from NAPL source zones. This recently reported gas flow generated by the spontaneous expansion of a discontinuous gas phase has not been extensively characterized in the literature. This study measured the expansion rate of a single gas cluster in a 1.1 mm sand above a pool of trans-1,2-dichloroethene (tDCE) in small-scale flow cell experiments. To characterize the gas flow, gas injection experiments in three sizes of sand were conducted at very slow injection rates typical of gas flow rates produced by gas expansion due to NAPL partitioning. Gas cluster spontaneous expansion rates above a tDCE pool were found to be 0.34 +/- 0.02 and 0.29 +/- 0.01 mL/day in duplicate experiments, which is sufficiently slow to result in discontinuous gas flow in porous media with a grain size diameter greater than 0.02 mm. Measured capillary pressures during gas injection showed patterns consistent with discontinuous gas flow, and identified multiple fragmentation events and expansion by coalescence with trapped clusters. The combination of pressure data and light transmission images were used to identify fragmentation and obtain direct measurements of the critical cluster length (i.e. the length at which withdrawal of the gas phase from a pore space occurs) in quasi-two-dimensional porous media for the first time. The measured critical cluster lengths were 1.4-3.6, 3.2-6.0 and 2.8-6.5 cm in 1.1, 0.7 and 0.5 mm sands, respectively. These values agreed well with estimates of the critical cluster length made using previously reported equations, and parameters derived from the medium's capillary pressure-saturation relationship.

AB Interception loss from the canopy is a major pathway for the loss of water from forest ecosystems. This study was conducted in an Oriental beech stand, neighboring Gorgan, representing typical forest characteristics of the Hyrcanian region. The Hyrcanian region is situated to the south of the Caspian Sea and covers approximately 1.8 million ha of the northern foothills of the Alborz Mountains in northern Iran. This region is characterised by temperate deciduous forests with Oriental beech stands, formed mainly of Fagus orientalis. Because these beech stands occupy 80% of the Hyrcanian region, rainfall interception via the tree canopy is an important pathway for water loss in this region. The main objectives of this study were to determine and model the precipitation components including stemflow, throughfall, net precipitation, and interception loss using gross precipitation and to understand how the diameter classes influence precipitation partitioning by comparing precipitation components across the tree diameter classes. A total of 31 beech trees with the following classes of diameter were randomly chosen: 11 trees of 30-60 cm (young), 10 trees of 60-100 cm (middle-aged), and 10 trees of 100-130 cm (old) of Diameter at Breast Height (DBH). Field measurements of gross precipitation, stemflow, and throughfall were made for 33 rainfall events over a period of 12 months from November 2005. Then, based on these measurements, net precipitation and interception loss were calculated. The value of gross precipitation was approximately 827 mm. Interception loss estimated to be about 53%, 57%, and 60% of gross precipitation corresponding to the tree diameter classes of 30-60, 60-100, and 100-130 cm, respectively. ANOVA results show that the values of the mean of precipitation components were significantly different across the diameter classes. There was an indirect relationship between tree diameter and the volumes of stemflow, throughfall, and net precipitation. Thus, a direct relationship between tree diameter and interception loss was observed. Since the values of the precipitation components were strongly dependent on per event variations in the gross precipitation, the power law regression model was parameterised to predict the values of precipitation components by the value of gross precipitation for each rainfall event. The models explained the variability in the precipitation components very well and are a suitable tool to predict these components of the water balance of forest ecosystems. The best model was obtained for interception loss across the different tree diameter classes. Additionally, some ecological implications of the results are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB The paper investigates the applicability of Kinematic and Diffusive Wave models for mud-flows with a power-law shear-thinning rheology. In analogy with a well-known approach for turbulent clear-water flows, the study compares the steady flow depth profiles predicted by approximated models with those of the Full Dynamic Wave one. For all the models and assuming an infinitely wide channel, the analytical solution of the flow depth profiles, in terms of hypergeometric functions, is derived. The accuracy of the approximated models is assessed by computing the average, along the channel length, of the errors, for several values of the Froude and kinematic wave numbers. Assuming the threshold value of the error equal to 5%, the applicability conditions of the two approximations have been individuated for several values of the power-law exponent, showing a crucial role of the rheology. The comparison with the clear-water results indicates that applicability criteria for clear-water flows do not apply to shear thinning fluids, potentially leading to an incorrect use of approximated models if the rheology is not properly accounted for.

AB We evaluate if the concept of thermal entropy production can be used as a measure to characterize hydrothermal convection in a confined porous medium as a valuable, thermodynamically motivated addition to the standard Rayleigh number analysis. Entropy production has been used widely in the field of mechanical and chemical engineering as a way to characterize the thermodynamic state and irreversibility of an investigated system. Pioneering studies have since adapted these concepts to natural systems, and we apply this measure here to investigate the specific case of hydrothermal convection in a box-shaped confined porous medium, as a simplified analog for, e.g., hydrothermal convection in deep geothermal aquifers. We perform various detailed numerical experiments to assess the response of the convective system to changing boundary conditions or domain aspect ratios, and then determine the resulting entropy production for each experiment. In systems close to the critical Rayleigh number, we derive results that are in accordance to the analytically derived predictions. At higher Rayleigh numbers, however, we observe multiple possible convection modes, and the analysis of the integrated entropy production reveals distinct curves of entropy production that provide an insight into the hydrothermal behavior in the system, both for cases of homogeneous materials, as well as for heterogeneous spatial material distributions. We conclude that the average thermal entropy production characterizes the internal behavior of hydrothermal systems with a meaningful thermodynamic measure, and we expect that it can be useful for the investigation of convection systems in many similar hydrogeological and geophysical settings.
   Plain Language Summary Hydrothermal convection patterns occur naturally in the Earth, for example in geothermal and volcanic systems, in deep aquifers, and along Mid-ocean ridges. We investigate here with numerical simulations how well the specific geometry of these systems can be predicted, especially in confined spaces that are often a reality in the subsurface. To do so, we use a thermodynamic measure, entropy production, as it provides us with a meaningful summary value for the overall fluid and heat flow in these systems. We find intriguing patterns of switch-points between different convection cell geometries that go beyond the structures so far predicted by theory. The results are therefore relevant for hydrothermal settings where convection plays a key role as a heat transport mechanism in the Earth.

AB Riemann problems at geometric discontinuities are a classic and fascinating topic of hydraulics. In the present paper, the exact solution to the Riemann problem of the one-dimensional (1-d) Shallow water Equations at monotonic width discontinuities is completely determined for any initial condition. This solution is based on the assumption that the relationship between the states immediately to the left and to the right of the discon-tinuity is a stationary weak solution of the 1-d variable-width Shallow water Equations. Under this hypothesis, it is demonstrated that the solution to the Riemann problem always exists, although there are cases where the solution is triple. This proves that it is possible to define width-jump interior boundary conditions of Saint Venant models that lead to well-posed problems, and that additional physical information is required to pick the relevant Riemann wave configuration among the alternatives when the solution is multiple. The analysis of an existing Finite Volume numerical scheme from the literature, based on flow variables reconstruction with preservation of specific energy and discharge, shows that the algorithm captures the solution with supercritical flow through the width discontinuity when multiple solutions are possible. This suggests that it is possible to change the algorithm accordingly to the structure of the physically relevant solution. Interestingly, the 1-d variable-width Shallow wa-ter Equations are formally identical to the 1-d Porous Shallow water Equations, implying that the exact solutions provided in the present paper are relevant for two-dimensional (2-d) Porous Shallow water numerical models aiming at urban flooding simulations. The procedure presented in this paper may be used not only to construct new challenging benchmarks for nu-merical schemes, but also as a guide for the construction of new algorithms, and for the interpretation of on-field and laboratory data related to transients at rapid channel width variations. The appearance of multiple solutions, which is connected to the hydraulic hysteresis phenomenon observed in the case of supercritical flows impinging a cross-section contraction, requires a criterion for the disambiguation of solutions. This will be the object of future research.

ID CONCENTRATION-DISCHARGE RELATIONSHIPS; HETEROGENEITY
AB Recent studies have focused on the relationship between solute concentrations and discharge in streams, demonstrating that concentrations can vary little relative to changes in discharge (chemostatic behaviour). Chemostatic behaviour is dependent on catchment characteristics (e.g., lithology, geomorphology, and vegetation) and chemical characteristics of the solute (e.g., availability, reactivity, and mobility). An investigation of 3 springs and a stream near Los Alamos, NM, reveals that springs can behave in a chemostatic fashion as stream systems tend to do. Another unique finding of this study is that the anthropogenic contaminants barium and the high explosive RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) can also behave chemostatically. The chemostatic behaviour of a contaminant has important implications for the residence time of contaminants in a system as well as having a major control on contaminant flux and mass transport. Redox (reduction-oxidation) and biogeochemically sensitive analytes (e.g., Fe, SO4, and NO3) display a combination of chemostatic and chemodynamic behaviour, showing the influence of temporally variable conditions on stream and spring chemistries.

AB A system has been installed to automatically monitor rainfall, streamflow, bedload discharge and suspended sediment concentration in the and to hyper-arid setting of Nahal Rahaf, Southern Judean Desert in Israel. The Rahaf gauging station is located in a relatively steep, wide channel with an unsteady bed driven by flash floods. It is an attempt to deploy modern automatic equipment for continuous sediment transport monitoring in harsh, and fluvial environments.
   Unit bedload discharges are the highest recorded hitherto, suggesting they may represent an upper end member in the worldwide climate-bedload discharge relationship. Suspended sediment concentration is much higher than is typical of perennial fluvial humid environments. There is high correlation between suspended sediment concentration and water discharge on an event scale, with diverse intra-event relations. The sediment yield of individual events is large, but the small number of floods limits the mean annual sediment yield to low values in this and environment. This also has environmental implications, as large-scale quarrying requires a long period of self-restoration in such an and fluvial setting. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper provides a Fuzzy methodology based on calculating the hydrological return period discharge and the resistance-load theory for designing an ogee spillway in a diversion dam. Hence, the uncertainties of rainfall intensity, catchment runoff coefficient, and spillway discharge coefficient are endowed with triangular Fuzzy numbers (TFNs), describing possible values the uncertain parameters may have. To do so, the rational formula and, later, the spillway discharge equation are analyzed here to obtain the Fuzzy products of the peak runoff and spillway discharge capacity. On the basis that both must match, the risk is calculated using the difference be-tween the obtained Fuzzy product quantities with three Fuzzy arithmetic operations. It is observed that the standard approximation closely tracks the result of the alpha-cut (exact) method, providing a time-saving tool for Fuzzy calculations. Since the return period (T) and risk of failure are related quantities, the spillway dimensions are calculated for several recurrence intervals, assuming risk equal to 1/T. Then, the Fuzzy approach is compared with the conventional return-period approach for the design of an ogee crest in three experimental catchments in Iran with adequate historical data. The result indicates that the Fuzzy technique outperforms the conventional return-period approach for designing an ogee spillway, obtaining an average 29% larger spillway dimension in all case studies. Beyond that, the Fuzzy procedure is applied to another catchment with short rainfall-runoff data, which is impossible to implement the conventional return-period method for the hydrologic design of an ogee spillway.

AB The redox conditions strongly affect redox kinetics, hydrochemical composition and microbial reactions under river bank filtration (RBF). For investigating the redox conditions, zonation factors, and microbial responses in a typical RBF with high Fe2+ and Mn2+ contents, three wells were established 20 m apart perpendicular to the south bank of the Songhua River with a constant flow rate of 400 m(3)/h. Redox zonation was identified from the redox sequences, redox products, reactions identified and seasonality. High-throughput sequencing, principal coordinates analysis, and redundancy analysis were used to identify the microbial responses to redox zonation. The results indicated that the RBF was stabilized after 21 d of water extraction with a 51%, 36% and 21% decrease of Fe2+, Mn2+ and NH4+ contents, respectively. Feature redox indices varied with strong regularity in the horizontal and vertical filtration directions, and the filtration area could be divided into O-2/NO3-, Fe/Mn, and SO(4)(2-& nbsp;)reduction zones. Seasonality resulted in markedly fluctuation of Fe2+ and Mn2+ contents in groundwater. Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, and Limnobacter were the dominant bacteria in the O-2/NO3-, Fe/Mn, and SO42- reduction zones, respectively. DO explained 21.1% of microbial variability in the fluctuation zone, while Mn2+ and Fe2+ explained 27.7%, and 26.2%, respectively, of microbial variability in the saturated zone.

AB Identifying the relationship between the stochastic daily rainfall regime and the dynamics of plants and soil moisture is fundamental for the sustainable management of dryland ecosystems in a context of global climate change. An eco-hydrological model that couples the dynamics of woody vegetation cover and deep soil moisture (typically with a depth interval of 30-150 cm) was used to investigate the effect of stochastic intensity and the intermittency of precipitation on soil moisture in this deep interval, which affects woody vegetation cover. Our results suggest that the precipitation intensity and intermittency play an important role in the dynamics of wood vegetation cover and deep soil moisture. In arid and semiarid regions, as the annual precipitation increased, the rate of woody vegetation cover increased as a power-law function, and the deep soil moisture increased exponentially. For a given annual rainfall, there were positive correlations between the rainfall intensity (or rainfall intermittency) and both the woody vegetation cover and deep soil moisture. The positive correlations between wood vegetation cover and both rainfall intensity and intermittency may decrease with increases in the precipitation intensity or precipitation intermittency. The positive correlations between deep soil moisture and both rainfall intensity and rainfall intermittency increase as the precipitation intensity or precipitation intermittency increases. Moreover, these positive correlations may increase with increases in the mean annual rainfall. Our results emphasize the importance of daily precipitation variations in controlling the responses of woody vegetation cover and deep soil moisture to climate variations in arid and semiarid regions. Our model can aid the understanding of rainfall processes and indicates that increases in rainfall intensity or rainfall intermittency may lead to an increase in woody vegetation cover and deep soil moisture given an invariable annual rainfall regime in dryland ecosystems.

AB A brief description of the Deterministic Modelling Hydrological System (DMHS) 'Runoff-Erosion-Pollution' proposed by the first author is presented. This system is being developed with the aim of giving it a universal character so that it can be applied in mountainous and flat terrain, and in basins of different natural climatic zones regardless of their size. The main feature of the model is its independence of the scaling problem. The basis of our approach consists of a simple theory of runoff elements. This is different from the generally accepted use of partial differential equations such as the Saint Venant equation for surface and channel flow and the Boussinesq equation for underground waters describing the water movement from runoff formation origins to the basin outlet. The results of runoff simulation for six mountainous watersheds of different sizes across Eastern Siberia within the Lena River basin and their statistical evaluation are presented. The selected river basins ranged in size from about 40 km(2) (small scale) to the entire Lena River basin (2.4 million km(2)), classified as a large-scale basin. Copyright.

AB Modelling melt and runoff from snow- and ice-covered catchments is important for water resource and hazard management and for the scientific study of glacier hydrology, dynamics and hydrochemistry. In this paper, a distributed, physically based model is used to determine the effects of the up-glacier retreat of the snowline on spatial and temporal patterns of melt and water routing across a small (0.11 km(2)) supraglacial catchment on Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland. The melt model uses energy-balance theory and accounts for the effects of slope angle, slope aspect and shading on the net radiation fluxes, and the effects of atmospheric stability on the turbulent fluxes. The water routing model uses simplified snow and open-channel hydrology theory and accounts for the delaying effects of vertical and horizontal water flow through snow and across ice. The performance of the melt model is tested against hourly measurements of ablation in the catchment. Calculated and measured ablation rates show a high correlation (r(2) = 0.74) but some minor systematic discrepancies in the short term (hours). These probably result from the freezing of surface water at night, the melting of the frozen layer in the morning, and subsurface melting during the afternoon. The performance of the coupled melt/routing model is tested against hourly discharge variations measured in the supraglacial stream at the catchment outlet. Calculated and measured runoff variations show a high correlation (r(2) = 0.62). Five periods of anomalously high measured discharge that were not predicted by the model were associated with moulin overflow events. The radiation and turbulent fluxes contribute c. 86% and c. 14% of the total melt energy respectively. These proportions do not change significantly as the surface turns from snow to ice, because increases in the outgoing shortwave radiation flux (owing to lower albedo) happen to be accompanied by decreases in the incoming shortwave radiation flux (owing to lower solar incidence angles) and increases in the turbulent fluxes (owing to higher air temperatures and vapour pressures). Model sensitivity experiments reveal that the net effect of snow pack removal is to increase daily mean discharges by c. 50%, increase daily maximum discharges by >300%, decrease daily minimum discharges by c. 100%, increase daily discharge amplitudes by >1000%, and decrease the lag between peak melt rates and peak discharges from c. 3 h to c. 50 min. These changes have important implications for the development of subglacial drainage systems. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB A GIS-based cell model, based on a kinematic approach is proposed to simulate debris flow routing on a fan. The sediment-water mixture is modeled as a monophasic continuum, and the flow pattern is discretized by square cells, 1 m in size, that coincide with the DEM cells. Flow occurs from cells with a higher mixture free surface to those with a lower mixture free surface. A uniform-flow law is used if the elevation of the former cell is higher than that of the latter; otherwise, the flow is simulated using the broad crested weir law. Erosion and deposition are simulated using an empirical law that is adjusted for a monophasic continuum. The sediment concentration in the routing volume is computed at each time step and controls both erosion and deposition. The cell model is used to simulate a debris flow that occurred on the Rio Lazer (Dolomites, North-Eastern Italian Alps) on November 4th, 1966. Furthermore, the hydrologic and the hydraulic conditions for the initiation of debris flow are simulated, providing the solid-liquid hydrograph of the resulting debris flow. A number of simulations has been carried out with physically reasonable parameters. The results are compared with the extension of the debris-flow deposition area and the map of observed depths of deposited sediments. This comparison shows that the proposed model provides good performance. The analysis of sensitivity carried out by systematically varying the model parameters shows that lower performances are associated with parameter values that are not physically reasonable. The same event is also simulated using a cellular automata model and a finite volume two-dimensional model. The results show that the two models provide a sediment deposition pattern less accurate than that provided by the present cell model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Models of water resources systems are conceived to capture the underlying environmental dynamics occurring within watersheds. All such models can be regarded as working hypotheses, differing in the aspects of process representation and conceptualization. Most of the associated efforts in the water resources research community is dedicated to development of new models that perform well under specific atmospheric conditions and catchment properties. In this context, flexible modeling frameworks are gaining importance as they facilitate the model building process by providing the model building blocks, whereby the hydrologist is free to assemble the model for task at hand. Such flexible models have high degree of transferability, which in turn aid in progressing toward a unified hydrological theory at catchment scale. However, in cases without sufficient insights regarding a catchment characteristics and/or lack of expert's knowledge, one may have to try a large number of model configurations based on available model building blocks to construct an appropriate model for the catchment of interest. Undoubtedly, this may be time consuming and computationally intensive. This paper proposes a novel model building algorithm, which uses the full potential of flexible modeling frameworks by searching the model space and inferring suitable model configurations relying on machine learning. Proposed machine learning algorithm is based on evolutionary computation approach using genetic programming (GP). State-of-art GP applications in rainfall-runoff modeling so far used the algorithm as a short-term forecasting tool that generates an expected future time series very similar to neural networks application. In this case, the proposed algorithm develops a physically meaningful rainfall-runoff model. Although at the moment we learn models using two flexible modeling frameworks (SUPERFLEX and FUSE), the model induction toolkit can be armed with any internal coherence building blocks. The model induction capabilities of the proposed framework have been evaluated on the Blackwater River basin, Alabama, United States. The model configurations evolved through the model induction toolkit are consistent with the fieldwork investigations and previously reported research findings.
   Key Points
   This paper presents a novel machine learning algorithm, which is guided through the incorporation of existing hydrological knowledge Proposed machine learning algorithm is based on evolutionary computation approach using genetic programming In the present case, the building blocks of flexible hydrological modeling frameworks represent elements of the background knowledge

AB As an alternative to the commonly used univariate flood frequency analysis, copula frequency analysis can be used. In this study, 58 flood events at the Litija gauging station on the Sava River in Slovenia were analysed, selected based on annual maximum discharge values. Corresponding hydrograph volumes and durations were considered. Different bivariate copulas from three families were applied and compared using different statistical, graphical and upper tail dependence tests. The parameters of the copulas were estimated using the method of moments with the inversion of Kendall's tau. The Gumbel-Hougaard copula was selected as the most appropriate for the pair of peak discharge and hydrograph volume (Q-V). The same copula was also selected for the pair hydrograph volume and duration (V-D), and the Student-t copula was selected for the pair of peak discharge and hydrograph duration (Q-D). The differences among most of the applied copulas were not significant. Different primary, secondary and conditional return periods were calculated and compared, and some relationships among them were obtained. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Hydrologically abandoned caves on tributaries of the Upper Cumberland River, Tennessee, USA record a wave of river incision that advanced up the drainage basin in the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. Geomorphic and geologic evidence suggests that incision occurred as a migrating knickpoint generated by sudden base-level lowering. The passage of a knickpoint up the Cumberland River tributaries was modeled as a perturbation to steady-state incision according to the stream power law E = kQ(m)S(n) and tested using dated incision events recorded in cave sediments. Knickpoint migration rates generated by this model were 0.1-0. 18 m/yr over the entire stream network, and 4.0 m/yr for the mainstem Cumberland River channel. The ratio m/n = 0.79 was consistent with previously published parameters; however, the values of m = 1.91 and n = 2.39 were much higher than those reported in previous field studies. These results suggest the stream power mode[ may be used to model. knickpoint migration in the study area, provided values for the constants m and n are larger. This may be due to the influence of fluviokarst where surface drainage is interrupted due to diversion into the underlying karst aquifer. Field measurements of channel and basin geometry in fluviokarstic tributaries to the Upper Cumberland River show (1) a stronger variance between channel slope and discharge; (2) a nonlinear relationship between discharge and drainage area; and (3) stream width to be nearly invariant, as opposed to non-karst watersheds. Because the stream power model relies heavily on the substitution of discharge for drainage area, the behavior of channel incision and knickpoint migration in fluviokarst may differ substantially from that of non-karst channels.

AB Transpiration of four different rainforest types in north Queensland, Australia, was determined using the heat pulse technique for periods ranging between 391 and 657 days. Despite the complexity of the natural rainforest systems being studied, the relationship between sample tree size and daily water use was found to be strong, thus providing a robust means by which to scale transpiration from individual trees to the entire forest stand. Transpiration was shown to be dependent on solar radiation and atmospheric demand for moisture with little evidence of limitation by soil moisture supply. Total stand transpiration was controlled by forest characteristics such as stem density, size distribution and sapwood area. Annual transpiration for each of the four sites ranged between 353 mm for cloud forest and 591 mm for montane rainforest. In comparison with the international literature, transpiration from Australian rainforests is low; the reasons for this could be related to a combination of differences in forest structure, climatic conditions, canopy wetness duration and tree physiology.

AB In order to characterise the fissure field provoked by the Super-Sauze mudslide (South French Alps) in the surface material, we conducted a seismic survey and compared the resulting P-wave tomogram to surface observations and cone penetrometer tests. The first results show that the distribution of the P-wave velocities correlates well with the fissure parameters, i.e. density, depth, and thickness, estimated from digital photographs and field observations. In addition, one finds good agreement between the P-wave velocity distribution and the material resistances interpolated from the penetrometer tests, indicating a probable physical relationship. The results of our study demonstrate that seismic azimuth tomography is efficient for characterising fissure systems with the main advantage of the method lying in the integration capacity of wave propagation compared to local mechanical tests. Provided that the correlation between P-wave velocity and fissure characteristics are confirmed at other sites, this technique could be the basis for future and more systematic studies of high-hazard zones related to landslides.

AB Using a dataset of gauged river discharges taken from sites in England and Wales, linear multilevel models (also known as mixed effects models) were applied to quantify the variability in discharge and the discharge-hydraulic geometry relationships across three nested spatial scales. A jackknifing procedure was used to test the ability of the multilevel models to predict hydraulic geometry, and therefore width, mean depth and mean velocity, at ungauged stations. These models provide a framework for making predctions of hydraulic geometry parameters, with associated levels of ucertainity using different levels of data availability. Results indicate that as one travels downstream along a river there is greater variability in hydraulic geometry than is the case between rivers of similar sizes. This indicates that hydraulic geometry (and therefore hydrology) is driven by catchment area to a greater extent than by natural geomorphological variations in the streamwise direction at the mesoscale but these geomorphological variations can still have a major impact on channel structure.

AB The major hydrological variables that may cause long-term salinity changes in fresh water takes are the volume of the lake, stream and/or groundwater inflows and outflows, direct rainfall, stream, groundwater, and rainfall salinity and evaporation. Measurements of these variables are usually subject to natural fluctuations and unavoidable errors of the measured data. Therefore, evaluation of the contribution of each component to the long-term salinity trends is difficult. In this work, it is shown that since salinization processes are linear, lakes are able to retain a 'solute influx memory', which records information about their lake-watershed-climate relationship in the past. Our objective was to test and verify a system approach method, which evaluates this 'memory', i.e. investigates the causes of long-term salinization processes in fresh water lakes. With this approach, a general expression is developed that represents the lake as a natural integrator of linear processes in space and time. The long-term change of the chloride concentration in the lake (representing salinity) reflects the long-term changes in each of the various past hydrological variables. The general theory of the lake as a natural integrator was tested by examination of the long-term salinity changes in Lake Kinneret, Israel. and Lake Biwa, Japan. The hydrology and salinity of both lakes are well monitored for several decades. In the analysis of Lake Kinneret, the long-term measurements of inflows, outflows and lake salinity were used to verify that the salinization mechanism follows the theory of complete mixing (system identification). In Lake Biwa the same approach was used, however, we assumed that the salinization mechanism was 'complete mixing', and the long-term measurements of the lake hydrology were used to investigate the reasons for increasing salinity (system detection). Since the system analysis is affected by uncertainties of the measured variables, a stochastic component was added, in order to take these uncertainties into account.

AB Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination is expected to play a pivotal role in helping to secure future global water supply. While the global reliance on SWRO plants for water security increases, there is no consensus on how the capital costs of SWRO plants will vary in the future. The aim of this paper is to analyze the past trends of the SWRO capital expenditures (capex) as the historic global cumulative online SWRO capacity increases, based on the learning curve concept. The SWRO capex learning curve is found based on 4,237 plants that came online from 1977 to 2015. A learning rate of 15% is determined, implying that the SWRO capex reduced by 15% when the cumulative capacity was doubled. Based on SWRO capacity annual growth rates of 10% and 20%, by 2030, the global average capex of SWRO plants is found to fall to 1,580 USD/(m(3)/d) and 1,340 USD/(m(3)/d), respectively. A learning curve for SWRO capital costs has not been presented previously. This research highlights the potential for decrease in SWRO capex with the increase in installation of SWRO plants and the value of the learning curve approach to estimate future SWRO capex.
   Plain Language Summary Seawater desalination is expected to play a pivotal role in helping to secure future global water supply as water demand surges and freshwater resources diminish. While there are various seawater desalination technologies, the dominant desalination technology is expected to be seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO). The aim of this paper is to understand how the capital cost of SWRO plants has changed in the past as more plants were built and operated. This is based on the "learning by doing'' concept that illustrates the relationship between cost reduction in industries and the increase in production output. The relevance for SWRO plants is studied by assessing 4,237 plants that were operated from 1977 to 2015. It is found that as the cumulative global capacity of SWRO plants doubled, the average capital cost reduced by 15%. The results suggest that for every future doubling of SWRO capacity, the capital cost will reduce by 15%. This is the first such observation presented for SWRO plants and can be used to project the future capital costs of SWRO plants.

DE hydrological database; CANOPEX; MOPEX; large dataset; Canadian hydrology
AB Over the past few years, many international initiatives and collaborations were launched to improve and share knowledge in hydrology research. Large databases allowed finding patterns and relationships across regions and scales. This paper introduces the Canadian model parameter experiment (CANOPEX) database, which is adapted from the US MOPEX project data and methods. The CANOPEX database includes meteorological and hydrometric data as well as watershed boundaries for 698 basins. Two sets of basin-averaged meteorological data (Maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation) are provided. The first dataset is directly taken from Environment Canada's weather stations whereas the second is extracted from the Natural Resources Canada gridded climate data product. Data are provided in MOPEX and Matlab formats. CANOPEX watersheds are well distributed over Canada, which allows investigating a variety of physiological and climatological conditions. The CANOPEX database can be used in a variety of hydrologic research projects such as climate change impact studies, model comparisons, multi-modelling, ensemble streamflow prediction and model parameter estimation. CANOPEX could be used to generalize findings to other cold climate catchments as well as assess the robustness of research methodologies and procedures. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The degree with which to parameterize a computer model that is to be used for risk-based resource management decision support has been a topic of much discussion in the environmental modeling industry, and remains a difficult choice facing practitioners. High-dimensional parameterization schemes allow for a more robust expression of model input uncertainty over traditional lower-dimensional schemes, but often incur a higher computational burden and require greater understanding of inverse problem theory to implement effectively. However, a number of significant questions remain, such as: "What level of parameterization is needed to adequately express uncertainty for a given decision-relevant simulated output?", and "To what extent can a simplified parameterization be adopted while maintaining the ability of the model to serve as a decision-support tool?". This study addresses these questions, among others, by using empirical paired complex-simple model analyses to investigate the consequences of reduced parameterization on decision-relevant simulated outputs in terms of bias incursion and underestimation of uncertainty. A Bayesian decision analysis approach is adopted to facilitate evaluation of parameterization reduction outcomes, not only in terms of the prior and posterior probability density functions of decision-relevant simulated outputs, but also in terms of the management decisions that would be made on their basis. Two integrated surface water/groundwater model case study examples are presented; the first is a complex synthetic model used to forecast groundwater abstraction-induced changes in ecologically-sensitive streamflow characteristics, and the second is a real-world regional-scale model (Hauraki Plains, New Zealand) used to simulate nitrate-loading impacts on water quality. It is shown empirically that, for some decision-relevant simulated outputs, even relatively high-dimensional parameterization schemes ( > 2,000 adjustable parameters) display significant bias in simulated outputs as a result of improper parameter compensation induced through history matching, relative to complex parameterization schemes ( > 100,000 adjustable parameters)-ultimately leading to incorrect decisions and resource management action. For other decision-relevant simulated outputs, however, reduced parameterization schemes may be appropriate for resource management decision making, especially when considering a prior uncertainty stance (i.e., without undertaking history matching) and when considering differences between simulated outputs that do not depend on local-scale heterogeneity.

AB The temporal variability of suspended sediment, nitrates (NO3) and dissolved (DOC) and particulate organic carbon concentrations was analysed in the Alegria agricultural watershed over a 2-year period. Nine storm events were studied, including an exhaustive analysis of hydrometeorological conditions, quantification of fluxes, and concentration-discharge hysteresis loop characterization. The overall aim was to study the variability in these components during storm events and determine the mechanisms (flow paths) affecting the trajectories, from the source to the stream. The forms, rotational patterns and trends of hysteretic loops were investigated, and relationships between hysteresis features and hydrological parameters were studied. The results revealed clear differences between particulate (suspended sediment, particulate organic carbon) and dissolved (DOC, NO3) matter transport responses. Movement of the particulate matter was attributed to surface water, as reflected in clockwise hysteresis loops, whereas dissolved matter showed, in general, counterclockwise hysteresis loops, indicating a time delay in the arrival of solutes to the stream. This could be related to subsurface flow paths for DOC and a groundwater source for NO3. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID DRIFTING SNOW; WIND-SPEED; TRANSPORT; MODEL; PROFILE; SAND
AB Several possible effects of blowing snow on the atmospheric boundary layer are investigated, mostly within the general framework of the Prairie Blowing Snow Model (PBSM). The processes of snow saltation and suspension are first described. Variations to the drift density profile are tested and the effects of stratification and density variation calculations are evaluated. Despite high density gradients of blowing snow, stratification effects on turbulence and the velocity profiles can generally be neglected. However, with saltating or suspended snow in a constant shear stress layer, part of the shear stress is carried by the particles. A highly simplified, single-phase approach, based on the density variation of the air-snow mixture coupled to a simple turbulent stress-strain relationship, is used to illustrate this. Sublimation rates in a column of blowing snow are calculated using the PBSM and results are compared with those obtained with a modified formulation which incorporates a spectrum of sublimating particles of varying sizes at each height in a steady-state surface boundary layer and different specifications of the ventilation velocity.

TI A methodology for discharge estimation and rating curve development at

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID PARAMETER MUSKINGUM METHOD; HYDRODYNAMIC DERIVATION; LOCAL STAGE
AB [1] A methodology for estimating discharges and development of rating curves at ungauged river sites is presented. The methodology employs a routing method, which is an extension of the variable parameter Muskingum stage hydrograph (VPMS) routing method developed by M. Perumal and K. G. Ranga Raju, for routing a given upstream stage hydrograph in a channel reach characterized by trapezoidal compound cross section to arrive at the stage hydrograph at the downstream site. Furthermore, the VPMS method also enables us to estimate the discharge hydrographs at the upstream and downstream sites. It is assumed that there is no lateral flow within the routing reach. For establishing the rating curve at the ungauged river site the following concept employed in the development of the VPMS method can be conveniently exploited: During unsteady flow, there exists a one-to-one relationship between the stage estimated at the ungauged site and the corresponding steady discharge, which occurs somewhere downstream of that location, and using the method employed in the VPMS method, one can estimate that steady discharge. By linking this discharge with the stage estimated at the ungauged site the rating curve can be established. This approach of developing the rating curve is verified for a number of hypothetical data sets, obtained using the MIKE 11 model, which is used as the benchmark model in this study. Furthermore, the appropriateness of the proposed extended VPMS routing method is verified using two sets of experimental data on unsteady flows, obtained from a laboratory channel with rectangular compound flow section. The methodology is also field tested using six sets of concurrent stage hydrograph data obtained at the upstream and downstream sites of a 15 km reach length of the Tiber River in central Italy, out of which only one set of data was used for calibrating the reach-averaged Manning's roughness coefficient. The close reproductions of the rating curves and discharge hydrographs recorded at the upstream and downstream sites demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be confidently used for rating curve development and discharge estimation at ungauged sites, thus avoiding the manual discharge measurement at any river site not subjected to backwater effects.

AB A new eight-direction algorithm (iFAD8) for the simulation of drainage directions on grid digital elevation models (DEMs) is presented. In this algorithm, a flexible triangular facet construction technique (ND infinity) is developed to provide local drainage directions ranging continuously from 0 degrees to 360 degrees. Subsequently, a flow aggregation technique using global deviations of local drainage directions is proposed to simplify the flow paths into a nondispersive format. Another algorithm (FAD8) accompanying the iFAD8 is also presented, which uses the D infinity directions as the local drainage directions. Then FAD8, iFAD8, and three existing algorithms are compared on 10 abstract terrains including nine basic terrains and a Himmelblau terrain. The algorithms are tested to reproduce exact slope lines and specific catchment areas derived from the terrain functions. The results show that iFAD8 has better performance than FAD8. Both iFAD8 and FAD8 outperform existing algorithms in most cases. The flow aggregation technique is shown to be an excellent choice for nondispersive drainage direction simulation based on infinite directions. The ND infinity direction based on flexible triangular facets is also an improvement to the local infinite direction of D infinity. We conclude that the iFAD8 algorithm can provide better definitions of drainage directions.
   Plain-language Summary Overland movement of water and soil plays an important role in hydrological cycle and geomorphologic evolution. Analysis and modeling of these processes rely on drainage direction information. Through digitalizing and discretizing a continuous terrain into a mass of grid cells, drainage direction can be assigned to each cell. The accuracy of drainage directions may have a tremendous impact on the hydrologic and geomorphologic modeling. So an advanced algorithm for determination of drainage direction is required. Many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. But there are some shortcomings in the existing algorithms. Here we present a new algorithm named iFAD8 to provide single drainage direction for each topographic cell. Two newly developed techniques are adopted in iFAD8 to improve both local drainage directions and global flow paths. iFAD8 partly optimizes the shortcomings of existing algorithms in theory and has a better performance on various terrains. Finally, iFAD8 will benefit hydrologic and geomorphologic modeling.
   Key Points
   A new nondispersive eight-direction algorithm to simulate drainage directions is developed The algorithm approximates theoretical drainage directions through flexible triangular facets A flow aggregation technique iterating global deviations of local drainage directions is purposed

AB In this paper, a recently theoretically deduced rill flow resistance equation, based on a power-velocity profile, is tested experimentally on plots of varying slopes in which mobile bed rills are incised. Initially, measurements of flow velocity, water depth, cross-sectional area, wetted perimeter and bed slope conducted in 106 reaches of rills incised on an experimental plot having a slope of 14% were used to calibrate the flow resistance equation. Then, the relationship between the velocity profile parameter , the channel slope, and the flow Froude number, which was calibrated using the 106 rill reach data, was tested using measurements carried out in plots having slopes of 22% and 9%. The measurements carried out in the latter slope conditions confirmed that (a) the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor can be accurately estimated using the proposed theoretical approach, and (b) the data were supportive of the slope independence hypothesis of rill velocity stated by Govers.

AB Compared to other estimation techniques, one advantage of geostatistical techniques is that they provide an index of the estimation accuracy of the variable of interest with the kriging estimation standard deviation (ESD). In the context of radar-raingauge quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), we address in this article the question of how the kriging ESD can be transformed into a local spread of error by using the dependency of radar errors to the rain amount analyzed in previous work. The proposed approach is implemented for the most significant rain events observed in 2008 in the Cevennes-Vivarais region, France, by considering both the kriging with external drift (KED) and the ordinary kriging (OK) methods. A two-step procedure is implemented for estimating the rain estimation accuracy: (i) first kriging normalized ESDs are computed by using normalized variograms (sill equal to 1) to account for the observation system configuration and the spatial structure of the variable of interest (rainfall amount, residuals to the drift); (ii) based on the assumption of a linear relationship between the standard deviation and the mean of the variable of interest, a denormalization of the kriging ESDs is performed globally for a given rain event by using a cross-validation procedure. Despite the fact that the KED normalized ESDs are usually greater than the OK ones (due to an additional constraint in the kriging system and a weaker spatial structure of the residuals to the drift), the KED denormalized ESDs are generally smaller the OK ones, a result consistent with the better performance observed for the KED technique. The evolution of the mean and the standard deviation of the rainfall-scaled ESDs over a range of spatial (5-300 km(2)) and temporal (1-6 h) scales demonstrates that there is clear added value of the radar with respect to the raingauge network for the shortest scales, which are those of interest for flash-flood prediction in the considered region.

AB Combined open channel flow is encountered in many hydraulic engineering structures and processes, such as irrigation ditches and wastewater treatment facilities. Extensive experimental studies have conducted to investigate combined flow characteristics. Nevertheless, there is no simple relationship that can fully describe the velocity profiles in a turbulent flow. The artificial neural network (ANN) has great computational capability for solving various complex problems, such as function approximation. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the applicability of the ANN for simulating velocity profiles, velocity contours and estimating the discharges accordingly. The velocity profiles measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter in the open channel of the Chihtan purification plant, Taipei, with different discharges at fixed measuring section and different depths are presented. The total number of data sets is 640 and the data sets are split into two subsets, i.e. training and validation sets. The backpropagation algorithm is used to construct the neural network. The results demonstrate that the velocity profiles can be modelled by the ANN, and the ANN constructed can nicely fit the velocity profiles and can precisely predict the discharges for the conditions investigated.

AB We assess the potential for estimating snow depth using observations in the visible and infrared spectral bands from the imager instrument onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). The approach makes use of a correlation between depth of the snowpack and satellite-derived subpixel fractional snow cover over non-forested and sparsely forested areas. To retrieve the snow depth we propose a simple analytical formula approximating the statistical relationship between the snow depth and the snow fraction.
   The primary focus of this study was the US Great Plains and Canadian prairies area. Daily maps of snow depth at a spatial resolution of 4 km have been produced for this region for four winter seasons from late 1999 to the beginning of 2003. Validation of the algorithm developed was performed through comparison of the satellite-based product with snow depth measurements made at first-order synoptic stations, US Cooperative Network stations and Canadian climate stations. The accuracy of snow depth retrievals was found to be about 30% of the observed snow depth for snow depths below 30 cm. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The crucial role of root-zone soil moisture is widely recognized in land-atmosphere interaction, with direct practical use in hydrology, agriculture and meteorology. But it is difficult to estimate the root-zone soil moisture accurately because of its space-time variability and its nonlinear relationship with surface soil moisture. Typically, direct satellite observations at the surface are extended to estimate the root-zone soil moisture through data assimilation. But the results suffer from low spatial resolution of the satellite observation. While advances have been made recently to downscale the satellite soil moisture from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission using methods such as the Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh), the assimilation of such data into high spatial resolution land surface models has not been examined to estimate the root-zone soil moisture. Consequently, this study assimilates the 1-km DisPATCh surface soil moisture into the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) to better estimate the root-zone soil moisture. The assimilation is demonstrated using the advanced Evolutionary Data Assimilation (EDA) procedure for the Yanco area in south eastern Australia. When evaluated using in-situ OzNet soil moisture, the open loop was found to be 95% as accurate as the updated output, with the updated estimate improving the DisPATCh data by 14%, all based on the root mean square error (RMSE). Evaluation of the root-zone soil moisture with in-situ OzNet data found the updated output to improve the open loop estimate by 34% for the 0-30 cm soil depth, 59% for the 30-60 cm soil depth, and 63% for the 60-90 cm soil depth, based on RMSE. The increased performance of the updated output over the open loop estimate is associated with (i) consistent estimation accuracy across the three soil depths for the updated output, and (ii) the deterioration of the open loop output for deeper soil depths. Thus, the findings point to a combined positive impact from the DisPATCh data and the EDA procedure, which together provide an improved soil moisture with consistent accuracy both at the surface and at the root-zone.

AB A process-based, conceptual runoff model, the tracer-aided catchment (TAC) model, is developed and applied to the 40 km(2) Brugga catchment in the Black Forest Mountains of southwest Germany. The model accounts for different runoff generation processes and runoff components. A lumped artificial neural network (ANN) model was also applied using the same data set. We compared the output from the two models in an effort to improve the efficiency of the TAC model and its model structure using physical and chemical data. Both approaches yielded comparably good results for daily discharge simulation. The TAC model, which uses spatially distributed input data, was superior to the lumped ANN model in only one case. Dissolved silica concentration in catchment runoff was used to assess the runoff components mixing approach of the conceptual TAC model. The ANN simulation of silica time series was superior to that of the TAC model. However, using modelled discharge values instead of measured data markedly weakened the silica predictions and resulted in a performance similar to the TAC model. We conclude that this reflects the inevitable non-linear error propagation within the TAC model. The ANN silica model improved substantially when hourly data were used instead of daily data. According to the ANN, silica dynamics are characterized by hysteresis loops in the discharge-silica concentration relationship in the short term. In addition, this relationship depends on the antecedent moisture conditions in the medium term. About 87% of the hourly silica time series variance was explained by non-linear regression with the hydrograph only. The implications of these findings are as follows. A simulation of the silica dynamics is possible using rather simple models that take into account the dynamics described above. In this respect, the TAC approach was confirmed by the ANN. However, an appropriate silica modelling time step must be shorter than daily values to be in line with the process time scale. Last but not least, the silica time series were assumed to reflect the spatial distribution of single hydrotopes to the catchment runoff during single storms, and thus to provide an independent check for the spatially distributed model in addition to the hydrograph. This has proven wrong, as the information provided by the silica data is highly redundant to that of the hydrograph, illustrated by the fact that the silica dynamics can be well described by the empirical model without requiring any spatial information.

AB Drought is a slow-onset, creeping natural hazard which is an inevitable part of normal climate fluctuation especially in arid and semiarid regions, and its variability can be explained in terms of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Standardized streamflow index (SSFI) was utilized to characterize hydrological drought in the west of Iran for the hydrological years of 1969-1970 to 2008-2009. The linkage of atmospheric circulation patterns (ENSO, NAO) to hydrological drought was also used to reveal relations of climate variability affecting hydrological drought. River discharges exhibited negative anomalies during the warm phase of ENSO (El Nino) which caused the extreme and severe droughts in the study area, being strongest during the hydrological years of 2007-2008 and 2008-2009. The analysis also indicated the teleconnection impact of ENSO on the hydrological drought severity in the first half of the hydrological year especially between November and March. Moreover, the concurrent and lag correlations revealed a weak relationship between the SSFI drought severity and the NAO index. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Considering that water flow energy affects the detachment of soil particles, the transport and deposit of the detached particles, the flow velocity is a key variable governing the soil erosion processes at the hillslope scale. The simple dye-tracer technique for measuring mean flow velocity can be applied in non-controlled field applications for which some measurement difficulties (e.g. due to sediment transport, and shallow flows) can occur. The correction factor is usually obtained as the ratio between the mean velocity, deriving from measurements of flow discharge and water depth, and surface velocity. Alternatively, the possibility of using the velocity profile in a given vertical to determine a suitable correction factor has not yet been explored. In this article, the flow velocity measurements were carried out in five verticals having a different distance from the wall of a flume whose bed was covered by hemispheres with different concentrations (9%-64%) and organized in two arrangements (square, staggered). Fifteen runs, characterized by different Reynolds and Froude numbers, were performed and the correction factor alpha(vv) was calculated for each vertical. For the axial vertical alpha(vv) was independent of the arrangement, decreased with the hemisphere concentration, and increased with both the Froude and Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, alpha(vv) decreased from the bank to the flume axis as a result of the varying shape of the velocity profile. The analysis showed that the frequency distributions of the ratio between alpha(vv) and its mean value alpha(m) were overlaid and alpha(m) was used to represent the correction factor, accordingly. A relation of alpha(m) with the distance from the flume wall was detected. For the measured velocity profiles having a power shape, the analysis also demonstrated that the alpha(vv) values, obtained by fitting the power law to the measurements, were close to both those calculated as the ratio between the mean velocity along the vertical and the surface velocity and their averaged values across the hydraulic section. These three methods give comparable average values of the correction factor, in the range of 0.72-0.75, which are close to the commonly applied value of 0.8. Finally, this investigation demonstrated that a single survey of a power velocity profile allows for obtaining the correction factor accounting for different verticals across the entire hydraulic section.

AB Methods for predicting unit plot soil loss for the 'Sparacia' Sicilian ( Southern Italy) site were developed using 316 simultaneous measurements of runoff and soil loss from individual bare plots varying in length from 11 to 44 m. The event unit plot soil loss was directly proportional to an erosivity index equal to (Q(R)EI(30))(1.47), being Q(R)EI(30) the runoff ratio (Q(R)) times the single storm erosion index (EI30). The developed relationship represents a modified version of the USLE-M, and therefore it was named USLE-MM. By the USLE-MM, a constant erodibility coefficient was deduced for plots of different lengths, suggesting that in this case the calculated erodibility factor is representative of an intrinsic soil property. Testing the USLE-M and USLE-MM schemes for other soils and developing simple procedures for estimating the plot runoff ratio has practical importance to develop a simple method to predict soil loss from bare plots at the erosive event temporal scale.

AB This paper deals with the coupling of a sediment modelling algorithm to an existing conceptual model of water and salt fluxes (LASCAM). In the model, sediment generation is based on a modified version of the universal soil loss equation. The sediment transport processes of channel deposition and re-entrainment, and bed degradation are coupled with the existing stream-routing algorithm of LASCAM. The model is applied to the Avon River Basin, a large, dry catchment in Western Australia. The paper highlights some of the scientific issues involved in quantifying the sediment discharge processes in this catchment and presents validation results comparing model predictions with observations of sediment transport at different locations in the catchment. The results indicate that despite the strongly non-linear relationship between stream flow and sediment load, both are predicted well by the model. The model also highlights that in the Avon River Basin, disproportionately more stream sediment is generated in the wheat belt region than in the lower catchment.

AB In this paper, we present the analysis of long-term (since 1989) hydrochemical data from two small (ca 1 km(2)) catchments in Central Scotland. Both catchments have experienced marked reductions in acid deposition. Time-series analysis of stream water alkalinity, although systematically changing as a result of recovery from acidification, was used to conceptualize how the composition and contribution of different hydrological sources responded over the study period. Nonlinear curve fitting methods allowed the temporal changes in concentration-discharge relationships to be sufficiently well described to assess the impact of reduced acid deposition on storm flow and baseflow hydrochemistry. A Bayesian compositional analysis was applied to facilitate chemically based hydrograph separation. This allowed temporal variation over longer time periods in catchment-scale hydrological source contributions (specifically groundwater) to be estimated. Although these showed no systematic trend, they did differ between the two catchments, most likely as a result of small, but significant differences in the riparian soil cover. Understanding such changes to high and low flows over time is of paramount importance as such flow extremes have the most relevance to applied problems, particularly those related to environmental change.

AB Since the late 1950s a series of soil conservation practices have been implemented in the Loess Plateau. It is important to assess the impact of these practices on hydrology at the catchment scale. The Jialuhe River catchment, a tributary of the Yellow River, with a drainage area of 1117 km(2) in the Loess Plateau, was chosen to investigate the hydrological responses to conservation practices. Parametric and non-parametric Mann-Kendall tests were utilized to detect trends in hydrological variables or their residuals. Relationships between precipitation and hydrological variables were developed to remove the impact of precipitation variability. Significant linear decreasing trends in annual surface runoff and baseflow were identified during the treated period from 1967 to 1989, and the rate of reduction was 1(.)30 and 0(.)48 mm/year, respectively. As result, mean annual surface runoff and baseflow decreased by 32% over the period of 1967 to 1989. Seasonal runoff also decreased during the treated period with the greatest reduction occurring in summer and the smallest reduction in winter. The response of high and low daily flow to conservation practices was greater than average flows. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The areal reduction factor (ARF) is a concept widely used in many hydrological applications. In this paper, assuming a "storm-centered" approach, new empirical laws for ARF estimation have been derived for the Calabria region (southern Italy), which are distinguished according to rainfall generation mechanisms typical of the Mediterranean area. Specifically, using data from the regional rain gauge network for the period 2002-2015, extreme events were separated into Convective Cells and Frontal Systems through a heuristic criterion to identify type-dependent ARFs. Significant differences were observed: more intense convective precipitation events evidenced a more pronounced decrease in empirical ARFs than storms related to frontal systems, with reductions up to approximately 50% for the median values at about 2000 km(2). Results were also compared to some of the most widely used "fixed-area" laws for ARF evaluation; overall, these lead to larger values compared to storm-centered ARFs derived for the investigated region. The proposed storm-centered methodology can find important applications in providing reference limits of ARF values to be properly used in the engineering design of hydraulic and hydrological infrastructures, and appears particularly suited for effective and reliable flood defense in early warning systems.

AB Transport Effectiveness (TE) of a discharge is defined as the product of the frequency of discharge and corresponding sediment transport rate. Maximization of TE function helps in finding the "effective discharge (Q(e))" which is responsible for the transfer of the majority of sediments over a prolonged period. This approach to determine Q(e) is famously known as Magnitude-Frequency Analysis (MFA). Conventionally, MFA involves the construction of the TE function by assuming (i) a location-specific probability density function (PDF) for discharge and (ii) power-law relationship between discharge and sediment transport rate. There have been attempts in the past to derive expressions for Q(e) by assuming positively skewed PDFs for discharge. The present study proposes a modified approach to estimate TE-based Q(e) for general discharge distribution datasets which alleviates the limitation of assuming a location-specific PDF. The approach involves the transformation of discharge data through Box-Cox transformation and subsequently performing MFA to determine Q(e). An expression for the analytical solution of TE-based Q(e) is derived for the proposed framework of MFA. The robustness of the approach is established through a simulation study by generating discharge data using lognormal, Gamma, and log Pearson type III distributions. In this study, the influence of the hysteresis effect was investigated for total as well as seasonal datasets according to the considerations of the rising and falling stages for 14 stream gauges in South Indian Rivers. The analysis is performed by using the suspended sediment load and discharge data whereas the bedload has been excluded. Subsequently, the estimates of Q(e) based on the proposed approach (Q(e)(PA)) were computed considering various sediment rating curves fitted for total, seasonal, stage and season-stage based datasets. Finally, the variation of Q(e)(PA) with various catchment descriptors was examined.

AB This study explores the prevalence of fracture clustering in natural networks and its influence on fluid flow and advective transport. Fracture networks from a compilation of previously published maps that encompass igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock types, various geological and tectonic settings, and a broad distribution of length scales are analyzed using a two-point correlation technique to characterize the spatial scaling between fracture barycenters. The correlation dimension (D-c) ranges from 1.47 to 1.89 with a median of 1.8. These results suggest that fracture networks often exhibit spatial clustering and are rarely Poissonian as commonly assumed. Synthetic Discrete Fracture Networks (DFNs) with constant and variable transmissivity applied to all fractures are generated for three clustering (D-c = 1.6, D-c = 1.8, and Poissonian) and power law length exponent (alpha = 1.4, alpha = 1.8, and alpha = 2.2) scenarios. Median particle breakthrough times are shown to increase by 10-70% as spatial clustering transitions from Poissonian to highly clustered (D-c = 1.6). Median particle breakthrough times also increase, by a factor of 1.2-3.4 (20-240%), when the power law length exponent increases from alpha = 1.4 to alpha = 2.2. As clustering increases (i.e., D-c reduces), breakthrough curves become highly variable and exhibit features indicative of enhanced solute retention. The increase in median breakthrough times with clustering persists with different network size and transmissivity distribution. These results indicate that spatial clustering and length exponent both significantly influence transport. The use of power-law length distributions in generating fracture networks is relatively common, whereas the spatial organization of fractures is rarely included in transport studies of fractured rock. Structural heterogeneity introduced by spatially clustered organization of fractures leads to substantial complexity in flow paths which is not captured by Poissonian DFNs.

AB Water inflow into a tunnel is usually estimated by assuming that the flow follows the linear Darcy's law. However, fluid flow in fractured-rock aquifers is prone to deviation from Darcy's law and gives rise to nonlinear flow phenomena due to significant inertial losses. This non-Darcian effect is seldom considered when evaluating water inflow into the tunnel in a fractured-rock aquifer. In this study, we investigated an analytical method for predicting water inflow into a tunnel considering the non-Darcian effect. A series of numerical simulations for water inflow into a tunnel were conducted with different combinations of parameters, where non-Darcian flow was considered and characterized by the Forchheimer's law. Based on the numerical results and an ingenious parameter integration method, a semi-empirical model was developed to analytically predict water inflow into a tunnel where the flow is under non-Darcian flow regime. The semi-empirical model includes the classic theoretical formula for predicting water inflow and the Forchheimer equation for describing non-Darcian flow. In this context, the non-Darcian effect on water inflow into a tunnel can be quantitatively estimated. This developed model has a concise expression satisfying dimensional consistency with the parameters having sound physical meanings, and it can be successfully reduced to the classic formula under the Darcy flow regime. The validity of this semi-empirical model was confirmed by numerical results, showing a high fidelity in predicting water inflow into a tunnel. By means of this proposed model, the error induced by neglecting non-Darcian effect was estimated for a large number of real engineering cases, which rapidly increased as a power function with the magnitude of water inflow into the tunnel. The necessity of considering the non-Darcian effect when calculating water inflow was thus proven, especially for massive tunnel gushing. The proposed model and the method used in this study can provide guidance for accurately predicting water inflow into a tunnel under a complex non-Darcian flow regime.

ID OPERATIONS
AB Imprecision involved in the definition of reservoir loss functions is addressed using fuzzy set theory concepts. A reservoir operation problem is solved using the concepts of fuzzy mathematical programming. Membership functions from fuzzy set theory are used to represent the decision maker's preferences in the definition of shape of loss curves. These functions are assumed to be known and are used to model the uncertainties. Linear and nonlinear optimization models are developed under fuzzy environment. A new approach is presented that involves development of compromise reservoir operating policies based on the rules from the traditional optimization models and their fuzzy equivalents while considering the preferences of the decision maker. The imprecision associated with the definition of penalty and storage zones and uncertainty in the penalty coefficients are the main issues addressed through this study. The models developed are applied to the Green Reservoir, Kentucky. Simulations are performed to evaluate the operating rules generated by the models considering the uncertainties in the loss functions. Results indicate that the reservoir operating policies are sensitive to change in the shapes of loss functions.

AB Monthly analyses of pH, conductance, alkalinity, total suspended solids, dissolved major cations (Na, K, Ca and Mg), and selected dissolved trace elements (Fe, Al, Mn, Cu, Zn and Cr) were conducted on waters of the lower Orinoco River from February 2004 to May 2006. The data show strong seasonal variability. Major cations had maximum concentrations at low water, and were correlated with pH, conductance and alkalinity because of the tributaries coming from the Andean zones, where the weathering of evaporites and carbonate shales controls water chemistry. K concentrations did not show any relation with evaporite weathering, probably because large amounts of K come from the Guayana Shield rivers as a consequence of feldspar weathering. The concentrations of dissolved Fe, Mn and Cu were highest during the high water stage. Concentrations of the elements K, Cr. Zn and Cu are correlated with each other but not with dissolved Fe and Al, which probably are complexed with humic and fulvic substances. Mn concentration did not show relationships with other variables. Inter-annual variability of dissolved elements is explained by temporal changes in precipitation.

Simulated hydrographs have a tendency to underestimate peak flows or may send a false signal during the recession periods when SWAT is applied to the Mihocheon Basin in South Korea. This was particularly evident for sub-basins that had a short travel time of much less than a day. In order to enhance the channel routing module in SWAT, an alternative routing technique in which Manning relationship is combined with a simple channel reach continuity equation is proposed in the present study. The advantage of the proposed routing technique is that parameters are readily available from channel morphological data and that it is applicable to small basins. Through simulations of specific events, this routing module that is incorporated into SWAT is almost free from instability errors and produces realistic flow depths and velocities unlike the original version of SWAT with Muskingum method.

AB The Runoff Model Based on Cellular Automata (RunCA) has been developed to simulate surface runoff at different scales by integrating basic cellular automata (CA) rules with fundamental measureable hydraulic properties. In this model, a two-dimensional lattice composed of a series of rectangular cells was employed to cover the study area. Runoff production within each cell was simulated by determining the cell state (height) that consists of both cell elevation and water depth. The distribution of water flow among cells was determined by applying CA transition rules based on the minimization-of-difference algorithm and the calculated spatially varied flow velocities. RunCA was verified and validated by three steps. Good agreement with the analytical solution was achieved under simplified conditions in the first step. Then, results from runoff experiments on small laboratory plots (2 m x 1 m) showed that the model was able to well predict the hydrographs, with the mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency greater than 0.90. RunCA was also applied to a large scale site (Pine Glen Basin, USA) with data taken from literature. The predicted hydrograph agreed well with the measured results. Simulated flow maps in this basin also demonstrated the model capability in capturing both the spatial and temporal variations in the runoff process. Model sensitivity analysis results showed that the calculated total runoff and total infiltration were most sensitive to the input parameters representing the final steady infiltration rate at both scales. The Manning's roughness coefficient and the setting of cell size did not affect the results much at the small plot scale, but had large influences at the large basin scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Saltwater intrusion is a serious issue in estuarine deltas all over the world due to rapid urban sprawl and water shortage. Therefore, detecting the major flow paths or locations at risk of saltwater intrusion in estuarine ecosystems is important for mitigating saltwater intrusion. In this paper, we introduce a centrality index, the betweenness centrality (BC), to address this problem. Using the BC as the weighted attribute of the river network, we identify the critical confluences for saltwater intrusion and detect the preferential flow paths for saltwater intrusion through the least-cost-path algorithm from a graph theory approach. Moreover, we analyse the responses of the BC values of confluences calculated in the river network to salinity. Our results show that the major flow paths and critical confluences for saltwater intrusion in a deltaic river network can be represented by the least cost paths and the BC values of confluences, respectively. In addition, a significant positive correlation between the BC values of confluences and salinity is determined in the Pearl River Delta. Changes in the salinity can produce significant variation in the BC values of confluences. Therefore, freshwater can be diverted into these major flow paths and critical confluences to improve river network management under saltwater intrusion. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Data on drop size distribution and kinetic energy load of rainstorms are basic for rainfall erosivity indices. A simple and relatively inexpensive instrument was used to asses the instantaneous intensity and kinetic energy load of rainstorms in Hong Kong. Both the drop size and the instantaneous kinetic energy load of rainfall in Hong Kong are greater than in temperate and subtropical climates. The high kinetic energy results from the large size and greater number of raindrops falling per unit time. A high correlation between the kinetic energy of rainfall and the amount of rainfall allows for a convenient estimate of the energy load of storms from the amount of rainfall. Of more significance to the erosion process is the determination that about 74% of the total annual rainfall is erosive, containing about three-quarters of the total annual energy load of the rains. The variability of rainfall parameters within a rainfall and from storm to storm is shown. The energy-intensity relationship, seasonal and annual distributions of rainfall erosivity are presented.

AB Debris-covered glaciers are increasingly studied because it is assumed that debris cover extent and thickness could increase in a warming climate, with more regular rockfalls from the surrounding slopes and more englacial melt-out material. Debris energy-balance models have been developed to account for the melt rate enhancement/reduction due to a thin/thick debris layer, respectively. However, such models require a large amount of input data that are not often available, especially in remote mountain areas such as the Himalaya, and can be difficult to extrapolate. Due to their lower data requirements, empirical models have been used extensively in clean glacier melt modelling. For debris-covered glaciers, however, they generally simplify the debris effect by using a single melt-reduction factor which does not account for the influence of varying debris thickness on melt and prescribe a constant reduction for the entire melt across a glacier.
   In this paper, we present a new temperature-index model that accounts for debris thickness in the computation of melt rates at the debris-ice interface. The model empirical parameters are optimized at the point scale for varying debris thicknesses against melt rates simulated by a physically-based debris energy balance model. The latter is validated against ablation stake readings and surface temperature measurements. Each parameter is then related to a plausible set of debris thickness values to provide a general and transferable parameterization. We develop the model on Miage Glacier, Italy, and then test its transferability on Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland.
   The performance of the new debris temperature-index (DETI) model in simulating the glacier melt rate at the point scale is comparable to the one of the physically based approach, and the definition of model parameters as a function of debris thickness allows the simulation of the nonlinear relationship of melt rate to debris thickness, summarised by the Ostrem curve. Its large number of parameters might be a limitation, but we show that the model is transferable in time and space to a second glacier with little loss of performance. We thus suggest that the new DETI model can be included in continuous mass balance models of debris-covered glaciers, because of its limited data requirements. As such, we expect its application to lead to an improvement in simulations of the debris-covered glacier response to climate in comparison with models that simply recalibrate empirical parameters to prescribe a constant across glacier reduction in melt.

AB Investigations of phosphorus cycling and transport in streams lend insight into potential mechanisms of nutrient sequestration and can help mitigate human impacts. In this study, we examined the relationship between transient storage and phosphorus uptake in a cold-water stream in western Wisconsin. Hydrological characteristics, nutrient spiralling metrics, macrophyte biomass, and geomorphological properties were quantified in 7 reaches of Spring Coulee Creek using injections of a conservative tracer alone or with added PO43-. Fraction of median travel time due to transient storage (F-med(200)) was correlated with macrophyte biomass (r=.794, p=.033), and PO43- uptake velocity was correlated with F-med(200) (r=.756, p=.049). Stepwise linear regression was used to build models for transient storage and uptake velocity. Macrophyte biomass, stream bed slope, and riffle to pool ratio accounted for 99.6% of the variation in transient storage (p<.001). Transient storage, canopy cover, and slope accounted for 98.0% of the variation in uptake velocity (p=.002). This study shows that transient storage, primarily resulting from macrophyte beds, can be a significant factor regulating phosphorus uptake in stream ecosystems.

AB The impact of climate change on the behaviour of intensity-duration-frequency curves is critical to the estimation of design storms, and thus to the safe design of drainage infrastructure. The present study develops a regional time trend methodology that detects the impact of climate change on extreme precipitation from 1960 to 2010. The regional time trend linear regression method is fitted to different durations of annual maximum precipitation intensities derived from multiple sites in Ontario, Canada. The results show the relationship between climate change and increased extreme precipitation in this province. The regional trend analysis demonstrates, under nonstationary conditions arising from climate change, that the intensity of extreme precipitation increased decennially between 1.25% for the 30-min storm and 1.82% for the 24-h storm. A comparison of the results with a regional Mann-Kendall test validates the found regional time-trend results. The results are employed to extrapolate the intensity-duration-frequency curves temporally and spatially for future decades across the province. The results of the regional time trend assessment help with the establishment of new safety margins for infrastructure design in Ontario. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID CLIMATE
AB Temperature indices from NOAA-AVHRR data were developed to predict diurnal and seasonal streamflow in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Masks of the primary land-cover types (snow, glacier ice, lake ice, and soils) were created from Landsat TM data using binary threshold methods. The masks were then scaled to AVHRR resolution using modal selection of pixels and applied to both diurnal and seasonal time series of AVHRR temperature data from the 1994-95 austral summer season. A temperature area index (TAI) was calculated for different land-cover types, as well as for the entire watershed. The TAI was defined as the number of pixels at or above a specified temperature. Diurnal discharge was well characterized by a linear relationship of streamflow to the TAI using a temperature threshold of 259 K from all land class pixels for lower Taylor Valley. Neither index successfully predicted seasonal discharge, most likely due to the mismatch of time scales between the satellite and streamflow data. The TAI has great potential for predicting diurnal streamflow in both Taylor Valley and other remote areas within the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Ground-water flow and the transport of contaminants in groundwater systems are strongly controlled by geologic heterogeneities. Because, the data available to model these subsurface heterogeneities are generally sparse, the observed groundwater flow, piezometric head at well locations, or the concentration profile of solutes provide valuable additional information about these complex subsurface systems. Regardless, there is likely to be considerable uncertainty associated with the predictions of the subsurface heterogeneities. This has motivated the development of several ensemble-based schemes for assimilating flow response data into predictions of subsurface heterogeneities. Most ensemble-based data assimilation methods including ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) or indicator-based data assimilation (InDA), used for assimilation of dynamic data into geologic models, utilize statistics in the form of covariances calculated using the ensemble of models to perform model updates. These covariance based updates do not preserve the complex spatial characteristics of geologic structures that are better represented using multiple-point statistics. Additionally, in EnKF, the mismatch between the observed and the simulated values are assumed to be linearly related to the parameter updates, and the distribution of the state variable is assumed to be multi-Gaussian. The spatial distribution of the primary variables like facies can be non-Gaussian because of the spatial continuity exhibited by channel facies (sands) and non-channel facies (clay), that have distinctly different properties. Also, the relationship between the mismatch and the parameter updates can be strongly non-linear. In indicator-based data assimilation (InDA) method the indicator transforms of parameter and mismatch variables are used, which affords the treatment of these variables as bi-variate non-Gaussian. Furthermore, in the indicator transformed space, restrictive linear assumption can also be lifted as the indicator transform is invariant under non-linear transformations. However, the updates are still governed by the bivariate interactions between the state variables. A multiple-point extension of InDA is proposed in this paper which utilizes existing multiple-point simulation algorithms like single normal equation simulation (SNESIM) in combination with InDA, to preserve the spatial characteristics of the geologic model while at the same time honor the observed flow or transport response. The proposed method is applied to a synthetic groundwater system with complex channel distributions. The channel features of the final updated ensemble of models is shown to converge towards the reference model and the ensemble flow responses are also shown to match the reference flow response.

AB The settling of cohesive sediment is ubiquitous in aquatic environments, and the study of the settling process is important for both engineering and environmental reasons. In the settling process, the silt particles show behaviors that are different from non-cohesive particles due to the influence of inter-particle cohesive force. For instance, the flocs formed in the settling process of cohesive silt can loosen the packing, and thus the structural densities of cohesive silt beds are much smaller than that of non-cohesive sand beds. While there is a consensus that cohesive behaviors depend on the characteristics of sediment particles (e.g., Bond number, particle size distribution), little is known about the exact influence of these characteristics on the cohesive behaviors. In addition, since the cohesive behaviors of the silt are caused by the inter-particle cohesive forces, the motions of and the contacts among silt particles should be resolved to study these cohesive behaviors in the settling process. However, studies of the cohesive behaviors of silt particles in the settling process based on particle-resolving approach are still lacking. In the present work, three-dimensional settling process is investigated numerically by using CFD-DEM (Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method). The inter-particle collision force, the van der Waals force, and the fluid-particle interaction forces are considered. The numerical model is used to simulate the hindered settling process of silt based on the experimental setup in the literature. The results obtained in the simulations, including the structural densities of the beds, the characteristic lines, and the particle terminal velocity, are in good agreement with the experimental observations in the literature. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the influences of non-dimensional Bond number and particle polydispersity on the structural densities of silt beds have been investigated separately. The results demonstrate that the cohesive behavior of silt in the settling process is attributed to both the cohesion among silt particles themselves and the particle polydispersity. To guide to the macro-scale modeling of cohesive silt sedimentation, the collision frequency functions obtained in the numerical simulations are also presented based on the micromechanics of particles. The results obtained by using CFD-DEM indicate that the binary collision theory overestimated the particle collision frequency in the flocculation process at high solid volume fraction.

AB High resolution radar rainfall fields and a distributed hydrologic model are used to evaluate the sensitivity of flood and flash flood simulations to spatial aggregation of rainfall and soil properties at catchment scales ranging from 75 to 983 km(2). Hydrologic modeling is based on a Hortonian infiltration model and a network-based representation of hillslope and channel flow. The investigation focuses on three extreme flood and flash flood events occurred on the Sesia river basin, North Western Italy, which are analysed by using four aggregation lengths ranging from 1 to 16 km. The influence of rainfall spatial aggregation is examined by using the flow distance as a spatial coordinate, hence emphasising the role of river network in the averaging of space-time rainfall. The effects of reduced and distorted rainfall spatial variability on peak discharge have been found particularly severe for the flash flood events, with peak errors up to 35% for rainfall aggregation of 16 km and at 983 km(2) Catchment size. Effects are particularly remarkable when significant structured rainfall variability combines with relatively important infiltration volumes due to dry initial conditions, as this emphasises the non-linear character of the rainfall-runoff relationship. In general, these results confirm that the correct estimate of rainfall volume is not enough for the accurate reproduction of flash flood events characterised by large and structured rainfall spatial variability, even at catchment scales around 250 km(2). However, accurate rainfall volume estimation may suffice for less spatially variable flood events. Increasing the soil properties aggregation length exerts similar effects on peak discharge errors as increasing the rainfall aggregation length, for the cases considered here and after rescaling to preserve the rainfall volume. Moreover, peak discharge errors are roughly proportional to runoff volume errors, which indicates that the shape of the flood wave is influenced in a limited way by modifying the detail of the soil property spatial representation. Conversely, rainfall aggregation may exert a pronounced influence on the discharge peak by reshaping the spatial organisation of the runoff volumes and without a comparable impact on the runoff volumes.

AB This paper presents an improved bivariate mixed distribution, which is capable of modeling the dependence of daily rainfall from two distinct sources (e. g., rainfall from two stations, two consecutive days, or two instruments such as satellite and rain gauge). The distribution couples an existing framework for building a bivariate mixed distribution, the theory of copulae and a hybrid marginal distribution. Contributions of the improved distribution are twofold. One is the appropriate selection of the bivariate dependence structure from a wider admissible choice (10 candidate copula families). The other is the introduction of a marginal distribution capable of better representing low to moderate values as well as extremes of daily rainfall. Among several applications of the improved distribution, particularly presented here is its utility for single-site daily rainfall simulation. Rather than simulating rainfall occurrences and amounts separately, the developed generator unifies the two processes by generalizing daily rainfall as a Markov process with autocorrelation described by the improved bivariate mixed distribution. The generator is first tested on a sample station in Texas. Results reveal that the simulated and observed sequences are in good agreement with respect to essential characteristics. Then, extensive simulation experiments are carried out to compare the developed generator with three other alternative models: the conventional two-state Markov chain generator, the transition probability matrix model, and the semiparametric Markov chain model with kernel density estimation for rainfall amounts. Analyses establish that overall the developed generator is capable of reproducing characteristics of historical extreme rainfall events and is apt at extrapolating rare values beyond the upper range of available observed data. Moreover, it automatically captures the persistence of rainfall amounts on consecutive wet days in a relatively natural and easy way. Another interesting observation is that the recognized "overdispersion" problem in daily rainfall simulation ascribes more to the loss of rainfall extremes than the under-representation of first-order persistence. The developed generator appears to be a sound option for daily rainfall simulation, especially in particular hydrologic planning situations when rare rainfall events are of great importance.

TI Theory for the semi-analytical calculation of oil recovery and effective
   relative permeabilities using streamtubes
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English

DE streamtubes; oil recovery; pseudofunctions; scale-up
AB A semi-analytical method has been developed for calculating oil recovery in two and three dimensions, and for calculating effective relative permeabilities for coarse grids. The calculations are based on the assumption that the effects of a changing mobility held can be accounted for by using fixed streamtube geometries with flowrates updated to account for the changing mobility distribution. The single-phase pressure distribution from a numerical solution of Laplace's equation is used to calculate the pressure distribution for a two-phase flow based on a mapping of the solution of the Buckley-Leverett equation onto the streamtubes derived from the single-phase solution. The displacement calculations for oil recovery are based on theory previously developed by Dykstra and Parsons, extended to include the effects of spatially varying permeability and continuously changing mobilities, as occurs in solutions of the Buckley-Leverett equation for typical values of the mobility ratio. This idea has also been extended to the calculation of effective relative permeabilities for coarse-grid simulation and finally establishes the proper rules for averaging the results of fine-grid numerical simulations of two-phase flow for the definition of effective two-phase flow properties on coarse grids. These calculations have been generalized to three-dimensional flows by the simple device of conceptually inserting a gridded plane across the flow and defining each streamtube at that location as those streamlines which pass through any one of the grid cells. When combined with time-of-flight calculations from the gridded plane to both the producer and injector, the distribution of pore volume along each streamtube can be calculated. This information, combined with a tabulation of the single-phase, steady-state pressure distribution along each streamtube, provides all of the information needed for the semi-analytical calculation of oil recovery and effective flow properties in three-dimensional flows.

AB A disproportionate increase or decrease in water table in response to n-finor water input or drainage is observed in shallow water table conditions inside drainage lysimeters. This increase happens because the capillary fringe of the shallow water table reaches up to or near the surface (Wieringermeer effect). The correlations between water table level changes and rainfall, seepage irrigation, drip irrigation, and drainage were analysed. Correlations with rainfall, seepage irrigation, and drainage were high (R-2 ranged from 0.46 to 0-97). Drip irrigation had low correlations due to the low rates of application (R-2 ranged from 0.26 to 0.44). Conventional methods of calculating recharge, such as multiplying the specific yield with the water table fluctuations, cannot be used for Wieringermeer effect situations. A method using water balance data and soil moisture at different depths in the lysimeters was developed to estimate recharge and upflux. The recharge results were used to develop the apparent specific yield S-ya, which could be used to calculate consequent recharge events from water table fluctuation data. Combining the water table fluctuation relationships developed with the Sya value will allow the prediction of recharge from rainfall and irrigation events without the need for soil moisture equipment.

AB [ 1] Facies-based geostatistical models have become important tools for analyzing flow and mass transport processes in heterogeneous aquifers. Yet little is known about the relationship between these latter processes and the parameters of facies-based geostatistical models. In this study, we examine the transport of a nonpoint source solute normal ( perpendicular) to the major bedding plane of an alluvial aquifer medium that contains multiple geologic facies, including interconnected, high-conductivity ( coarse textured) facies. We also evaluate the dependence of the transport behavior on the parameters of the constitutive facies model. A facies-based Markov chain geostatistical model is used to quantify the spatial variability of the aquifer system's hydrostratigraphy. It is integrated with a groundwater flow model and a random walk particle transport model to estimate the solute traveltime probability density function (pdf) for solute flux from the water table to the bottom boundary ( the production horizon) of the aquifer. The cases examined include two-, three-, and four-facies models, with mean length anisotropy ratios for horizontal to vertical facies, e(k), from 25: 1 to 300: 1 and with a wide range of facies volume proportions ( e. g., from 5 to 95% coarse-textured facies). Predictions of traveltime pdfs are found to be significantly affected by the number of hydrostratigraphic facies identified in the aquifer. Those predictions of traveltime pdfs also are affected by the proportions of coarse-textured sediments, the mean length of the facies ( particularly the ratio of length to thickness of coarse materials), and, to a lesser degree, the juxtapositional preference among the hydrostratigraphic facies. In transport normal to the sedimentary bedding plane, traveltime is not lognormally distributed as is often assumed. Also, macrodispersive behavior ( variance of the traveltime) is found not to be a unique function of the conductivity variance. For the parameter range examined, the third moment of the traveltime pdf varies from negatively skewed to strongly positively skewed. We also show that the Markov chain approach may give significantly different traveltime distributions when compared to the more commonly used Gaussian random field approach, even when the first- and second-order moments in the geostatistical distribution of the lnK field are identical. The choice of the appropriate geostatistical model is therefore critical in the assessment of nonpoint source transport, and uncertainty about that choice must be considered in evaluating the results.

AB [1] A two-layer soil moisture model was developed to infer the controls on the tree/grass coexistence in a savanna ecosystem. The model was applied along a mean annual precipitation gradient in southern Africa, known as the Kalahari Transect (KT), which follows a north-south decline in mean annual rainfall from similar to1600 mm/yr to similar to 250 mm/yr between the latitudes 12degrees- 26degreesS. Satellite-derived fractional covers for trees, grass, and bare soil were used as input to the model, with the fractional grass cover responsive to interannual variability in rainfall, as defined by observed statistics. Other inputs to the model included satellite-based radiation budget measurements and interpolated, ground-based rainfall measurements. The soil moisture model structure allows both trees and grass to have access to the upper zone, while trees alone can extract water from the lower zone. We focus our analysis on the wet season months of November - March, in which 87% of the annual rainfall is received along the KT. Simulations were performed on daily time steps for 16 years, representing a range of interannual rainfall variability, at 196 equally spaced positions along the transect. The results indicate that two distinct areas of the KT exist in terms of vegetation-rainfall relationships. North of 18 degreesS, the trees and grass are rarely water stressed during the wet season and a large portion of the water balance is accounted for by leakage through the bottom of the root zone in sandy soils. The vegetation cover in the northern end of the transect does not reach its potential in terms of water exploitation and is most likely nutrient limited. In the southern portion of the KT, tree fractional cover is such that trees become water stressed in drier than average wet seasons and suffer no water stress during wetter than average wet seasons. The extent of the fractional grass cover for individual years is controlled by the water demand stress. We find that observed tree/grass fractional cover in the water-limited region of the transect is best explained by considering, on an individual basis, an allowable range of stress for trees and grass, while minimizing the amount of water that is unexploited by the vegetation and lost as leakage from the root zone.

AB The Middle East region, where arid and semi-arid regions occupy most of the land, is extremely vulnerable to any natural or anthropogenic reductions in available water resources. Much of the observed interannual-decadal variability in Middle Eastern streamflow is physically linked to a large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In this work, the relationship between the NAO index and the seasonal and annual streamflows in the west of Iran was statistically examined during the last four decades. The correlations were constructed for two scenarios (with and without time lag). The associations between the annual and seasonal streamflows and the simultaneous NAO index were found to be poor and insignificant. The possibility of streamflow forecasting was also explored, and the results of lag correlations revealed that streamflow responses at the NAO signal with two and three seasons delays. The highest Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.379 was found between the spring NAO index and the autumn streamflow series at Taghsimab station, indicating that roughly 14% of the variance in the streamflow series is associated with NAO forcing.

AB Mean transit times (MTTs) can give useful insights into the internal processes of hydrological systems. However, our understanding of how they vary and scale remains unclear. We used MTT estimates obtained from delta O-18 data from 20, mostly nested, contrasting catchments in North East Scotland, ranging from 1 to 1700 km(2). The estimated MTTs ranged between 270 and 1170 days and were used to test a previously developed multiple linear regression (MLR) model for MTT prediction based on metrics of soil cover, landscape organization and climate. We show that the controls on MTT identified by the MLR model hold with the independent data from these 20 sites and that the MLR can be used to predict MTT in ungauged montane catchments. The dominant controls also remain unchanged over four orders of magnitude of catchment size, suggesting no major change of dominant flow paths and mixing processes at larger scales. This is consistent with the fact that only the variance of MTT, rather than MTT, showed a scaling relationship. MTTs appeared to converge with increasing catchment scale, apparently due to the integration of heterogeneous headwater responses in larger downstream catchments.

TI Characterizing landscape-scale erosion using Be-10 in detrital fluvial

AB Concentrations of in situ Be-10 measured in detrital fluvial sediment are frequently used to estimate long-term erosion rates of drainage basins. In many regions, basin-averaged erosion rates are positively correlated with basin average slope. The slope dependence of erosion allows model-based erosion rate estimation for unsampled basins and basins where human disturbance may have biased cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in sediment. Using samples collected from southeastern North America, we demonstrate an approach that explicitly considers the relationship between average basin slope and erosion rate. Because dams and reservoirs are ubiquitous on larger channels in the field area, we selected 36 undammed headwater subbasins (average area 10.6 km(2)) from which we collected river sand samples and measured Be-10 concentrations. We used these data to train a predictive model that relates average basin slope and Be-10-inferred erosion rate. Applying our model to 28 basins in the same region previously studied with Be-10, we find that the model successfully predicts erosion rates for basins of different sizes if they are undammed or if samples were collected >25 km downstream of dams. For samples collected closer to dams, measured erosion rates exceed modeled erosion rates for two-thirds of the samples. In three of four cases where paired samples were collected upstream of reservoirs and downstream of the impounding dam, Be-10 concentrations were lower downstream. This finding has implications for detrital cosmogenic studies, whether or not samples were collected directly downstream of dams, because dams obstruct most major rivers around the world, effectively trapping sediment that originated upstream.
   Plain Language Summary Measuring the rate at which Earth eroded before humans arrived and changed the landscape is tricky business. Over the last two decades, geologists have used a collection of chemical and isotopic techniques, based on counting atoms rare in nature, to estimate how quickly parts of the landscape erode. They've collected and analyzed thousands of samples and now we know that some regions of the globe erode so rapidly that the landscape changes a few centimeters every hundred years whereas other landscape are so stable, only a hair's width of rock will erode per millennium. The problem is that dams can get in the way. Working in the heavily dammed southeastern United States, we show that samples collected within 25 kilometers of dams often lead to inaccurate results, overestimating long term erosion rates. We conclude that recent, human impacts on the landscape are likely even more damaging than previously thought, stripping soil and farm land at an unsustainable rate.

AB Debris flows are flows of water and sediment driven by gravity that initiate in the upper part of a stream, where the slope is very steep, allowing high values of solid concentration (hyperconcentrated flows), and that stop in the lower part of the basin, which is characterized by much lower slopes and reduced speeds and concentrations. Modelling these flows requires mathematical and numerical tools capable of simulating the behavior of a fluid in a wide range of concentrations of the solid phase, spanning from hyperconcentrated flows to flows in the fluvial regime. According to a two-phase approach, the depth integrated equations of mass and momentum conservation for water and sediments, under the shallow water hypothesis, are employed to solve field problems related to debris flows. These equations require suitable closure relations that in this case should be valid in a very wide range of slopes. In the hypothesis of absence of cohesive material, we derived these closure relations properly combining the relative relations valid separately in the fluvial and in the hyperconcentrated regimes. In the intermediate regime, the shear stress is due to the combined effect of the deformation of the liquid phase (grain roughness turbulence) and of inter-particle collisions. Therefore, an approach based on the sum of the effects of the two causes has been proposed, combining the Darcy-Weisbach equation and the Bagnoldian grain-inertia theory.
   A similar treatment has been made for the transport capacity relations, combing the Bagnold expression of the collisional regime with a transport capacity monomial formula valid in the fluvial regime.
   The closure relations are expressed in non-dimensional form as a function of the Froude number, of the solid concentration, of the relative submergence, and of the slope.
   In order to test the closure relation, a set of experiments with mixtures of non-cohesive sediments and water have been carried out in a laboratory flume under steady uniform flow conditions, with different solid and liquid discharges and different grain size distributions. The closure equations are satisfactorily tested against experimental investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses multi-step drainage experiments in two heterogeneously packed sand columns (10 x 10 x 20 cm(3)). Different packing structures were generated using two different sand types. One purpose of the study was to test the influence of packing structures on the movement of water. The second purpose was to assess the quality of predictions for the outflow curves in both columns made with an upscaled model. The heterogeneous structures of the columns can be considered as two opposing extremes. The first column was packed with a random arrangement of two sand types that is not stochastically homogeneous and where a cluster running through the column exists for both materials. The second column was packed with a periodic pattern of coarse-sand inclusions in a fine-sand background and has a clearly defined unit cell. The depth-averaged (2D) spatial distribution of the water content in the columns was monitored during the whole multi-step outflow experiment using neutron radiography. The 3D water content was measured at the steady states by neutron tomography. The experimental results are compared with the model predictions of an upscaled model derived with the homogenization theory. The parameters for the upscaled model are calculated from the hydraulic parameters of the two sand types. These hydraulic parameters were first identified in independent measurements on samples of the two individual sand types, separately. Additionally, the hydraulic parameters of both sands were identified by fitting a numerical model to the measured outflow curves. The different column structures showed a significant effect on water retention and the effective retention function, as water was trapped in the coarse-sand inclusions of the periodic structure. We included this trapping effect in the effective retention function of the upscaled model with an apparent air entry pressure. Contrary to the retention, the different packing structures had no large effect on the dynamic behavior of the outflow. The effective conductivity of the columns is therefore not significantly influenced by the structure. The upscaled models predicted the movement of the averaged water content in the two columns well. This confirms the applicability of upscaled models even if the underlying requirements are not strictly met. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Similarity between heat and water vapor turbulent transport in the Atmospheric Surface Layer has been the basis of many engineering models to calculate surface fluxes, including the widely applied Bowen ratio equation, for a long time. Modernly, it is best understood within the context of Monin-Obkhov Similarity Theory (MOST). In this work we study similarity between temperature and humidity, the Bowen ratio, and turbulent mass and heat transfer coefficients over a tropical lake in Brazil (Furnas Lake). The analysis was partly based on the concept of 'Surface flux numbers' recently proposed to diagnose scalar similarity, and considered wind directions and flux footprints. A period of 50 days of 30-min. micrometeorological runs was used. Several cases of dissimilar temperature-humidity behavior were found in the data. Both footprint extent and an aggregate temperature-humidity Surface flux number turned out to be insufficient to diagnose these situations, but separate flux numbers for each scalar were able to diagnose their individual conformity to MOST. Overall, temperature displayed consistently larger relative variances and fluxes in comparison with humidity. The results highlight the need of careful analysis when measurements are made at sites close to land, when flux footprints may extend over there, indicating the possibility of advection effects.

AB Mud flows represent one of the major causes of natural hazards in mountain regions. Similarly to debris flows, they consist of a hyper-concentrated mixture of water and sediments flowing down a slope and may cause serious damages to people and structures. The present paper investigates the force produced by a dam-break wave of mud impacting against a rigid wall. A power-law shear-thinning model is used to describe the rheology of the hyper-concentrated mixture. A one-dimensional shallow water model is adopted and a second-order Finite Volume scheme is employed to numerically solve the governing equations. The results indicate that depending on the fluid rheological parameters and on the bottom slope, there exists a minimum value of the wall distance above which the peak force does not exceed the asymptotic value of the hydrostatic final condition. For two different values of the channel slope, the dimensionless value of this lower bound is individuated for several values of the power-law exponent and of a dimensionless Basal Drag coefficient. An estimation of the maximum peak force for wall distance smaller than the minimum value is also provided.

AB Stream water-use is essential for both agricultural and hydrological management and yet not many studies have explored its non-stationarity and nonlinearity with meteorological variables. This study proposed a deep-learning based model to estimate agricultural water withdrawal using hydro-meteorological variables, which projected the changes of agricultural water withdrawal influenced by climate change of future. The relationships between meteorological variables and stream water-use rate (WUR) were quantified using a deep belief network (DBN). The influences of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and monthly averaged WUR on the performance of the developed DBN model were tested. As a result, this DBN with potential evapotranspiration (PET) provided better performances than precipitation to estimate the WUR. The PET of multi-model scenarios for Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 would be increased as time goes by, and thus leads to increase WUR estimated by DBN in three basins, located in South Korea during the future period. On the contrary, water availability expected to decrease compared to the current. Therefore, managing water-uses and improving efficiencies can be prepared for the change in agricultural water-use by climate change in the future.

AB The Russian engineer Kornev in his 1935 book raised perspectives of subsurface negative pressure irrigation, which have been overlooked in modern soil science. Kornev's autoirrigation utilizes wicking of a vacuumed water from a porous pipe into a dry adjacent soil. We link Kornev's technology with a slightly modified Philip (1984)'s analytical solutions for unsaturated flow from a 2-D cylindrical pipe in an infinite domain. Two Darcian flows are considered and connected through continuity of pressure along the pipe-soil contact. The first fragment is a thin porous pipe wall in which water seeps at tension saturation; the hydraulic head is a harmonic function varying purely radially across the wall. The Thiem solution in this fragment gives the boundary condition for azimuthally varying suction pressure in the second fragment, ambient soil, making the exterior of the pipe. The constant head, rather than Philip's isobaricity boundary condition, along the external wall slightly modifies Philip's formulae for the Kirchhoff potential and pressure head in the soil fragment. Flow characteristics (magnitudes of the Darcian velocity, total flow rate, and flow net) are explicitly expressed through series of Macdonald's functions. For a given pipe's external diameter, wall thickness, position of the pipe above a free water datum in the supply tank, saturated conductivities of the wall and soil, and soil's sorptive number, a nonlinear equation with respect to the total discharge from the pipe is obtained and solved by a computer algebra routine. Efficiency of irrigation is evaluated by computation of the moisture content within selected zones surrounding the porous pipe.
   Plain Language Summary Subsurface irrigation by automatic gadgets like pitchers or porous pipes is a water saving technology which minimizes evaporative losses and deep percolation. Moisture is emitted by capillary suction of a relatively dry soil and thirsty roots just in right quantities, spontaneously and continuously, i.e. without any electronic or mechanical controls. Almost a century ago the Russian engineer Vasily Kornev designed and tested this smart watering technology in France and USSR. Later, the Australian soil physicist John Philip developed mathematical models which predicted how much water is emitted from a porous pipe and how this moisture is distributed in the near-emitter soil. We develop further Philip's theory and match it with Kornev's farmers-level design and irrigation practices. Namely, we predict how the pipe wall properties and negative water pressure in porous pipes are controlling soil water conditions.

AB This series of papers addresses the transport of sorbing solutes in groundwater. In part 2, plume dispersion, as quantified by the particle displacement variance, X11R(t), is linked to hierarchical sedimentary architecture using a Lagrangian-based transport model. This allows for a fundamental understanding of how dispersion arises from the hierarchical architecture of sedimentary facies, and allows for a quantitative decomposition of dispersion into facies-related contributions at different scales within the hierarchy. As in part 1, the plume behavior is assumed to be controlled by linear-equilibrium sorption and the heterogeneity in both the log permeability, Y=ln?(k), and the log distribution coefficient, =ln?(Kd). Heterogeneity in Y and arises from sedimentary processes and is structured by the consequent sedimentary architecture. Our goal is to understand the basic science of the dispersion process at this very fundamental level. The spatial auto and cross covariances for the relevant attributes are linear sums of terms corresponding to the probability of transitioning across stratal facies types defined at different scales. Unlike previous studies that used empirical relationships for the spatial covariances, here the model parameters are developed from independent measurements of physically quantifiable attributes of the stratal architecture (i.e., proportions and lengths of facies types, and univariate statistics for Y and ). Nothing is assumed about Y- point correlation; it is allowed to differ by facies type. However, it is assumed that Y and variance is small but meaningful, and that pore-scale dispersion is negligible. The time-dependent spreading rate is a function of the effective ranges of the cross-transition probability structures (i.e., the ranges of indicator correlation structures) for each relevant scale of stratal hierarchy. As in part 1, the well-documented perchloroethene (PCE) tracer test at the Borden research site is used to illustrate the model. The model was parameterized with univariate statistics for Y, of (PCE), and proportions and lengths of lithologic facies types defined at two scales within a two-level hierarchical classification, as given by Ritzi et al. (). The model gives a viable explanation for the observed PCE plume dispersion, and thus X11R(t) can be explained by the process of linear equilibrium sorption and the heterogeneity in k and Kd. The results quantitatively show that the k- Kd cross correlation, though small, and varied by facies type, can significantly impact the particle displacement variance. Furthermore, by quantitatively decomposing the dispersion into facies-related contributions, we gain the fundamental insight that that the time-dependent rate of spreading is mostly defined by the cross-transition probability correlation structure imparted by the proportions and sizes of the larger-scale facies types.

AB Although fractional integration and differentiation have found many applications in various fields of science, such as physics, finance, bioengineering, continuum mechanics, and hydrology, their engineering applications, especially in the field of fluid flow processes, are rather limited. In this study, a finite difference numerical approach is proposed to solve the time-space fractional governing equations of 1-dimensional unsteady/non-uniform open channel flow process. By numerical simulations, results of the proposed fractional governing equations of the open channel flow process were compared with those of the standard Saint-Venant equations. Numerical simulations showed that flow discharge and water depth can exhibit heavier tails in downstream locations as space and time fractional derivative powers decrease from 1. The fractional governing equations under consideration are generalizations of the well-known Saint-Venant equations, which are written in the integer differentiation framework. The new governing equations in the fractional-order differentiation framework have the capability of modelling nonlocal flow processes both in time and in space by taking the global correlations into consideration. Furthermore, the generalized flow process may possibly shed light on understanding the theory of the anomalous transport processes and observed heavy-tailed distributions of particle displacements in transport processes.

AB Regression techniques are often used to predict responses across landscapes or under scenarios describing changes in climate, management, or land cover. The ability of random forests (RFs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to predict flow variability, low flow, Escherichia coli, and a macroinvertebrate community index was compared. Cross validation was applied to test predictive performance across an induced spectrum of interpolation to extrapolation by splitting each data set into two geographical, environmental, and random groups. RF and MARS both represent nonlinear and interacting patterns but showed contrasting ability to interpolate and extrapolate. RF always performed better than MARS when interpolating within environmental space or extrapolating in geographical space. RF models for all four responses were transferable in geographic space but not to environmental conditions outside the training data. Neither technique was successful when extrapolating across environmental gradients, although RF out-performed MARS, despite RF predictions being constrained by the training data. New methods to quantify interpolation versus extrapolation for predictions are demonstrated. Degree of extrapolation is calculated by transforming both the training data and new predictors in response turnover space. A decline in cross-validation performance was related to an increase in degree of extrapolation regardless of whether extrapolating in geographical or environmental space. Degree of extrapolation is valuable. It identifies those predictions that are more reliable because they represent interpolation versus those that are more uncertain that represent extrapolation. For example, high degree of extrapolation under climate or land cover change indicates increased risk of producing misleading predictions from both RF and MARS.
   Plain Language Summary Regression models are used across the environmental sciences to find patterns between a response and its potential predictors. These patterns can be used to predict a response across broad areas or under new environmental conditions. This paper compares performance of two flexible regression techniques when predicting across a deliberately induced spectrum of interpolation to extrapolation. Various data sets were divided into two geographical, environmental and random groups. Models were trained on one half of the data and tested on the other. The two methods incorporate nonlinear and interacting relationships but suffer from unquantified uncertainty when extrapolating. Random forests always performed better than multivariate adaptive regression splines when interpolating within environmental space, and when extrapolating in geographical space. Random forests models were transferable in geographic space but not to environmental conditions outside the training data. Neither technique was successful when extrapolating across environmental gradients. The paper also describes and tests a new method to calculate degree of extrapolation: a value quantifying interpolation versus extrapolation for each prediction from either regression technique. The method can be used to indicate risk of spurious predictions when predicting at new locations (e.g., nationally) or under new environmental conditions (e.g., climatic change).

AB The utility of minor and trace elements for subglacial solute-provenance and hydrological flow-routing studies is investigated at Haut Glacier d'Arolla (HGA), Switzerland. Principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the bulk meltwater chemistry indicates the concentration of most major ions, and some minor and trace elements (Sr, Mo, Ti) are inversely related to bulk meltwater discharge and have a clear hydrological control. Conversely, many other minor and trace elements have no clear relationship with meltwater discharge. This suggests that Such Solutes are affected by physico-chemical controls such as sorption, (oxy)hydroxide formation and co-precipitation reactions, in addition to any simple hydrological influence. PCA applied to rock digests and water-rock interaction experiments indicates the complexity of determining the lithogenic source of minor and trace elements from subglacial chemical weathering processes. This reflects the complex aqueous mobility of many minor and trace elements and the heterogeneous geology of the HGA catchment. However, the study suggests that there is potential in minor and trace elements for solute-provenance and flow-routing studies in glacierized catchments underlain by a more homogeneous geology.

   AGRICULTURAL SOILS
AB Many groundwater contaminants react with components of the aquifer matrix, causing a depletion of the aquifer's reactivity with time. We discuss conceptual simplifications of reactive transport that allow the implementation of a decreasing reaction potential in reactive-transport simulations in chemically and hydraulically heterogeneous aquifers without relying on a fully explicit description. We replace spatial coordinates by travel-times and use the concept of relative reactivity, which represents the reaction-partner supply from the matrix relative to a reference. Microorganisms facilitating the reactions are not explicitly modeled. Solute mixing is neglected. Streamlines, obtained by particle tracking, are discretized in travel-time increments with variable content of reaction partners in the matrix. As exemplary reactive system, we consider aerobic respiration and denitrification with simplified reaction equations: Dissolved oxygen undergoes conditional zero-order decay, nitrate follows first-order decay, which is inhibited in the presence of dissolved oxygen. Both reactions deplete the bioavailable organic carbon of the matrix, which in turn determines the relative reactivity. These simplifications reduce the computational effort, facilitating stochastic simulations of reactive transport on the aquifer scale. In a one-dimensional test case with a more detailed description of the reactions, we derive a potential relationship between the bioavailable organic-carbon content and the relative reactivity. In a three-dimensional steady-state test case, we use the simplified model to calculate the decreasing denitrification potential of an artificial aquifer over 200 years in an ensemble of 200 members. We demonstrate that the uncertainty in predicting the nitrate breakthrough in a heterogeneous aquifer decreases with increasing scale of observation.
   Plain Language Summary Many aquifers can break down nitrate that was introduced into the groundwater by farmers. Unfortunately, this natural ability is lost over time while the reaction takes place. When modelling this process, one faces the difficulty that many parameters are not or only little known. That's why we have to run many models with different parameters. In existing models, the decreasing ability to break down the nitrate could not be accounted for. In our model, we look at the important factors controlling this process. By that, we can account for the decreasing reaction potential. And we are still able to calculate this so fast that many model runs are possible. We believe that this is an important contribution to the existing models because it helps to make better predictions about nitrate in groundwater and to get a better understanding of what is really happening.

AB The macrodispersion model from stochastic transport theory is demonstrated to be of limited utility when applied to heterogeneous aquifer systems containing narrow connected pathways. This is so even when contrasts in hydraulic conductivity (K) are small and variance in ln K is less than 0.10. We evaluated how well an advection-dispersion model (ADM) could be used to represent solute plumes transported through mildly heterogeneous three-dimensional (3-D) systems characterized by a well-connected dendritic network of 10 cm wide high-K channels. Each high-K channel network was generated using an invasion percolation algorithm and consisted of similar to10% by volume high-K regions. Contrasts in K between the channels and matrix were varied systematically from 2: 1 to 30: 1, corresponding to ln K values ranging from 0.04 to 1.05. Simulations involved numerical models with 3-D decimeter discretization, and each model contained 2-4 million active cells. Transport through each channel network considered only the processes of advection and molecular diffusion. In every case, the temporal change in the second spatial moment of concentrations was linear, with R 2 values ranging from 0.97 to 0.99. The third spatial moment, or alternatively, the skewness coefficient values, indicated significant tailing downstream of the plume center. For each case, a corresponding ADM was used to simulate transport through the system. The corresponding ADM employed the effective mean hydraulic conductivity that reproduced the total discharge through the channel network system under an identical ambient gradient. Dispersivity values used in the ADM were obtained from the temporal change in the second spatial moments of concentrations for the plumes in the channel network systems and ranged from 0.014 m to 0.85 m. The results indicate that as the conductivity contrast between the channels and matrix increased, the simulated plumes in the channel network system became more and more asymmetric, with little solute dispersed upstream of the plume center and extensive downstream spreading of low concentrations. Distinctly different spreading was found upstream versus downstream of the plume center. The ADM failed to capture this asymmetry. Comparison of each plume in the channel network system with the corresponding plume produced using the corresponding ADM showed a maximum correlation of only 0.64 and a minimum fractional error of 0.29 for cases in which the log K variance was similar to0.20 (ln K variance was similar to1.0). At early times the correlations were as low as 0.40. The greatest correlation occurred at late times and for cases in which a wide source was considered.

AB There is a high degree of uncertainty about the state and fate of Pakistan's Karakoram glaciers due to data scarcity in high altitude regions. They are thought to be less vulnerable to climatic change because they behave differently as compared with eastern Himalayas. This study measures the decadal temporal changes in the glacial ice area of Karakoram's Hunza River Basin, one of the eight subbasins of Upper Indus Basin. An attempt has been made to investigate the relationship between glacial ice area changes and calculated values of precipitation, temperature and run-off. A combination of satellite and field-based approach is applied. Output includes maps of glacial ice hypsometries of eight glacial ice subregions of Hunza River Basin for 3 years (i.e., 1989, 2002, and 2010). The results show a decreasing trend in the glacial ice-covered area signifying a reduction of 20.47% with the largest reduction being in the lower elevation bands. There is presently no conclusive answer as to why glacial ice in the Karakoram is acting differently from the near-global indication of glacial ice changes. Climate data from high altitudes are needed to find answer for this anomalous behaviour.

AB Fresh water-the bloodstream of the biosphere-is at the center of the planetary drama of the Anthropocene. Water fluxes and stores regulate the Earth's climate and are essential for thriving aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as water, food, and energy security. But the water cycle is also being modified by humans at an unprecedented scale and rate. A holistic understanding of freshwater's role for Earth system resilience and the detection and monitoring of anthropogenic water cycle modifications across scales is urgent, yet existing methods and frameworks are not well suited for this. In this paper we highlight four core Earth system functions of water (hydroclimatic regulation, hydroecological regulation, storage, and transport) and key related processes. Building on systems and resilience theory, we review the evidence of regional-scale regime shifts and disruptions of the Earth system functions of water. We then propose a framework for detecting, monitoring, and establishing safe limits to water cycle modifications and identify four possible spatially explicit methods for their quantification. In sum, this paper presents an ambitious scientific and policy grand challenge that could substantially improve our understanding of the role of water in the Earth system and cross-scale management of water cycle modifications that would be a complementary approach to existing water management tools.
   Plain language summary Freshwater is crucially important for all life on Earth. There is abundant research and evidence on how different processes within the water cycle regulate climate and support ecosystems, and by extension, human societies. Humans are also a major force disturbing those processes and modifying the water cycle. These modifications include, for instance, surface water withdrawals, groundwater pumping, deforestation and other land cover change, and ice melt due to warming climate. As most previous research on human-water interactions focuses on understanding systems at smaller scales, such as a watershed or a nation, comprehensive understanding of what human modifications of the water cycle mean for the stability of the planet is still lacking. In this paper we propose a new framework for analysing and establishing limits to a variety of human modifications of the water cycle, to ensure that the stability of the Earth would not be compromised. We see this as an important and urgent scientific challenge that has the potential to substantially improve our understanding of the functioning of the Earth system and to inform local and global policy toward a more sustainable future.
   Key Points
   Earth system resilience depends on an improved understanding and management of water cycle modifications We identify four key functions of freshwater in the Earth system and evidence of regional to global regime shifts and disruptions The water planetary boundary is a compelling framework to improve our understanding and management of water cycle modifications in the Earth system

ID SCHEMES
AB In many countries, the determination of the parameters of the wave, likely to be produced after the failure of a dam, is required by law, and systematic studies are mandatory. There is a necessity to develop adequate numerical solvers which are able to reproduce situations originated from the irregularities of a non-prismatic bed and to model the complete equations that progress despite the irregular character of the data. Many hydraulic situations can be described by means of a one-dimensional (1D) model, either because a more detailed resolution is unnecessary or because the flow is markedly ID. Many techniques have been developed recently for systems of conservation laws in 1D tin the context of gas dynamics). Some years after their adoption for solving problems in gas dynamics, upwind and total variation diminishing (TVD) numerical schemes have been successfully used for the solution of the shallow water equations, with similar advantages. Their use is nevertheless only gradually gaining acceptance in this sector. The performance of some of these techniques for practical applications in river flow is reported in this work.

AB The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission has long been used as a source topographic information for flood hazard models, especially in data-sparse areas. Error corrected versions have been produced, culminating in the latest global error reduced digital elevation model (DEM)-the Multi-Error-Removed-Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM. This study investigates the spatial error structure of MERIT and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, before simulating plausible versions of the DEMs using fitted semivariograms. By simulating multiple DEMs, we allow modelers to explore the impact of topographic uncertainty on hazard assessment even in data-sparse locations where typically only one DEM is currently used. We demonstrate this for a flood model in the Mekong Delta and a catchment in Fiji using deterministic DEMs and DEM ensembles simulated using our approach. By running an ensemble of simulated DEMs we avoid the spurious precision of using a single DEM in a deterministic simulation. We conclude that using an ensemble of the MERIT DEM simulated using semivariograms by land cover class gives inundation estimates closer to a light detection and ranging-based benchmark. This study is the first to analyze the spatial error structure of the MERIT DEM and the first to simulate DEMs and apply these to flood models at this scale. The research workflow is available via an R package called DEMsimulation.
   Plain Language Summary A lack of accurate digital elevation models (DEMs) for flood inundation modeling in data-sparse regions means that predictions of flood inundation are subject to substantial errors. These errors have rarely been assessed due to a lack of information on the spatial structure of DEM errors. In this study, we analyze the vertical DEM error and how this error varies spatially for both the widely used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM and an error reduced variant of SRTM called Multi-Error-Removed-Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM for 20 lowland locations. We then use the spatial error characteristics to simulate plausible versions of topography. By simulating many statistically plausible topographies, flood models can assess the effects of uncertain topography on predicted flood extents. We demonstrate this by using a collection of simulated DEMs in flood models for two locations. We conclude that using an ensemble of MERIT DEMs simulated using the spatial error disaggregated by land cover class gives flood estimates closest to that of a benchmark flood model. This study is of interest to others as our calculated spatial error relationships can be used to simulate floodplain topography in the MERIT/SRTM data sets through our open-source code, allowing for probabilistic flood maps to be produced.

AB Atmospheric rivers (ARs), narrow atmospheric water vapor corridors, can contribute substantially to winter precipitation in the semiarid Southwest U.S., where natural ecosystems and humans compete for over-allocated water resources. We investigate the hydrologic impacts of 122 ARs that occurred in the Salt and Verde river basins in northeastern Arizona during the cold seasons from 1979 to 2009. We focus on the relationship between precipitation, snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, and extreme flooding. During the cold season (October through March) ARs contribute an average of 25%/29% of total seasonal precipitation for the Salt/Verde river basins, respectively. However, they contribute disproportionately to total heavy precipitation and account for 64%/72% of extreme total daily precipitation (exceeding the 98th percentile). Excess precipitation during AR occurrences contributes to snow accumulation; on the other hand, warmer than normal temperatures during AR landfallings are linked to rain-on-snow processes, an increase in the basins' area contributing to runoff generation, and higher melting lines. Although not all AR events are linked to extreme flooding in the basins, they do account for larger runoff coefficients. On average, ARs generate 43% of the annual maximum flows for the period studied, with 25% of the events exceeding the 10 year return period. Our analysis shows that the devastating 1993 flooding event in the region was caused by AR events. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity on the hydrology of inland semiarid regions: ARs are critical for water resources, but they can also lead to extreme flooding that affects infrastructure and human activities.
   Plain Language Summary Within the Salt and Verde River basins in the semiarid northeastern Arizona, natural ecosystems and humans compete for over-allocated water resources. The basins are highly dependent on winter precipitation for ecosystem functioning, water supply, fire suppression, and in the case of extreme events, for water quality, flood control and dam safety. Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are narrow corridors of concentrated water vapor that bring copious amount of rainfall from the Pacific into the region and contribute to its hydrology by increasing snow pack and replenishing soil moisture in the basins. ARs are also responsible for extreme precipitation and streamflow events, such as the 1993 flooding event, which caused human casualties and economic losses. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity on the hydrology of inland semiarid regions: ARs are critical for maintaining natural ecosystem health, but they can also lead to extreme flooding that affects infrastructure and human activities.

AB Balancing the multiple purposes of reservoir operation, including the social, economic, and ecological aspects, has become one of the most complicated problems facing the managers and operators worldwide. This paper formulates a detailed mathematical model to optimize the reservoir operation during the flood season, considering the three major operational purposes, i.e. flood control (social purpose), energy production (economic purpose), and management of sediment transport (ecological purpose). The entire formulations conform to a nonlinear programming (NLP) model, which can be solved effectively and efficiently by the Multi-Start Solver from the LINGO software through equivalent transformation. This model is applied to the Three Gorges Project (TGP) in China, which is the world's largest and most complex hydraulic engineering in operation. Three typical flood hydrographs (i.e. dry, normal, and wet scenarios) are selected as model inputs under the three strategies (i.e. design operating rules, increasing the flood control water level (FCWL), and impounding in advance). The trade-offs among these three major operational purposes are quantitatively analyzed. Moreover, phosphorus (P), one of the sediment-associated environmental factors, is introduced for exploring its responses to various scenarios and strategies. Results indicate that a higher fore-bay water level leads to a greater energy production, a smaller flood peak but less sediment and P transports to the downstream. Under the design operating rules, the maximum energy production of the TGP can reach 560,620, and 699 x 10(8) KWh, respectively, in dry, normal, and wet scenarios, corresponding to a flood peak of 25000-27500 m(3)/s, a sediment load of 1517-1999 x 10(4) t, and a P load of 3152-3740 x 10(4) kg to the downstream. Whereas, the maximum sediment loads are 2796,4640, and 5377 x 10(4) t, and the maximum P loads are 4021,5345, and 5784 x 10(4) kg, respectively, in dry, normal, and wet scenarios, corresponding to an energy production of 500-588 x 10(8) KWh, and a flood peak of 38600-52500 m(3)/s to the downstream. In terms of achieving the comprehensive benefits of the TGP, impounding in advance is a better choice than both the design operating rules and increasing the FCWL, for it can increase the energy production and the probability of full refill with almost no increase in flood risk to both the dam and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River as well as smaller reduction in the sediment and P transports. The formulated detailed mathematical model is a general one that is applicable to a variety of reservoirs owning multiple operational purposes. Moreover, the achievements gained from this paper will provide important references for the managers and operators.

AB Understanding of near-surface soil moisture variability at different spatial scales and associated dominant physical controls is limited. In the past, soil moisture dynamics studies have been conducted extensively at different spatial scales using both in situ and remote sensing (RS) data in the subhumid Southern Great Plains region, which has mostly pasture and range land cover with rolling topography. Compared to the past efforts, we investigated the space-time characterization of near-surface soil moisture and associated physical controls at multiple scales (field, watershed, and region) in a humid hydroclimatic region with different topography and agricultural land cover. Soil moisture data from two different measurement support scales (theta probe based (point scale) and airborne RS derived; footprint scale, 800 m x 800 m), obtained during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02) in Iowa were used. Geostatistical analysis showed the spatial soil moisture correlation lengths varied between 78 m and 307 m (at the field scale), 2044 m and 11,882 m (at the watershed scale), and 19,500 m and 118,500 m (at the regional scale). The correlation length values were usually smaller on wet days than the relatively dry days at the field and watershed scales. The trend was opposite at the regional scale with correlation lengths being larger on wet days. Furthermore, the soil moisture data sets were decomposed into spatial Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) patterns, and their relationship with various geophysical parameters (rainfall, topography, soil texture, and vegetation) was examined to determine the dominant control on the near-surface soil moisture variability. At the field scale, the first four EOFs together explained about 81% of the total variability. At the watershed scale, the first two EOFs were dominant explaining about 93% of the total variance, whereas at the regional scale, the primary EOF itself explained more than 70% of the variance. In other words, the complicated dynamics of near-surface soil moisture fields can be described by a few underlying orthogonal spatial structures related to the geophysical attributes of the region. Correlation analysis of the RS soil moisture data showed that rainfall, topography, and soil texture have mixed effects on the variability explained by the dominant EOFs, at both watershed and regional scales, with limited influence of vegetation parameters. The effect of rainfall on the soil moisture variability is higher at the watershed scale compared to the regional scale in Iowa.

AB The Turkey Lakes Watershed (TLW) study is a federal, interdepartmental study established in 1979 to investigate the effects of acid rain on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The 10.5 km(2) watershed, located in the Eastern Temperate Mixed Forest on the Canadian Shield, has been the site of multidisciplinary studies on biogeochemical and ecological processes conducted across plot to catchment scales. The whole-ecosystem investigative approach was adopted from the outset and has allowed research to evolve from its original (and continuing) acidification focus to include investigations on the effects of climate change, forest harvesting and other forest ecosystem perturbations. The extensive scientific and support infrastructure allows for collection of a comprehensive data record essential for understanding long-term environmental trends. Data include atmospheric deposition, meteorology, stream hydrology and chemistry, soil, pore and ground water properties, understory and overstory vegetation, lake and outflow physical and chemical properties, and aquatic macroinvertebrate and fish community composition and abundance. These data have contributed to over 400 published research papers and graduate theses. The watershed has also figured prominently in many continent-wide comparisons advancing fundamental watershed theory. The knowledge gained at TLW has influenced pollutant emission and natural resource management policies provincially, nationally and internationally.

TI A PHYSICAL EXPLANATION OF AN OBSERVED LINK AREA-SLOPE RELATIONSHIP
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RIVER NETWORKS
AB An observed log-log linear relationship between channel slope and contributing area is explained by the erosional physics that lead to catchment form. It is postulated that tectonic uplift is in balance with the fluvial erosion downwasting that dominates catchment erosion, and it is shown that this relationship results in the observed log-log linear relationships at dynamic equilibrium. In addition, it has been observed that there are deviations from this log-log linear relationship near the catchment divide, with observed slopes being lower than those predicted from the relationship. This is explained by noting that for small areas, fluvial erosion effects are dominated by soil creep and rain splash, modeled by diffusive physics. The area at which this deviation from log-log linearity occurs is that point on the hillslope at which diffusive physics, like soil creep and rain splash, begin to dominate fluvial erosion. These predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations using a catchment evolution model.

AB The climate elasticity of runoff is an important indicator that is used to quantify the relationship between changes in runoff and changes in climate variables. It is a function of both climate and catchment characteristics. Recently, Yang and Yang (2011) proposed an analytical derivation of climate elasticity (YY2011), in which a parameter n was used to represent the impact of the catchment characteristics. In China, both climate and catchment characteristics have large spatial variations. To understand the spatial variation of hydrologic response to climate change, this paper divided China into 210 catchments, further calculated the parameter n, and then estimated the climate elasticity and evaluated the contribution of climate change to runoff for each catchment. The results show that n ranges from 0.4 to 3.8 (with a mean of 1.3 and a standard deviation of 0.6), which has a logarithmic relationship with catchment slope; the precipitation elasticity ranges from 1.1 to 4.8 (with a mean of 1.9 and a standard deviation of 0.6), which shows a large regional variation, smaller values (1.1-2.0) mainly appearing in Southern China, the Songhua River basin and the Northwest, and larger values (2.1-4.8) mainly appearing in the Hai River basin, the Liao River basin and the Yellow River basin. In addition, climate contribution to runoff exhibits a large regional variation, the largest positive values (1.1-3.1%/a) occurring in the Northwest, the largest negative values (-1.0 to -0.5%/a) occurring in the Hai River basin and the middle reach of the Yellow River basin. In theory, the YY2011 method is a first-order approximation. The approximation underestimates the precipitation (P) contribution to runoff when P increases and overestimates that when P decreases, and the relative error has a median of similar to 3% and a maximum of similar to 20% when 10% precipitations change in those catchments of China.

AB Efficient use of water and nutrients in crop production are critical for sustainable water and crop production systems. Understanding the role of humans in ensuring water and nutrient use efficiency is therefore an important ingredient of sustainable development. Crop production functions are often defined either as functions of water and nutrient deficiency or are based on economic production theory that conceptualizes production as a result of economic activities that take in inputs such as water, capital and labor and produce crop biomass as output. This paper fills a gap by consistently treating water and nutrient use and human agency in crop production, thus providing a better understanding of the role humans play in crop production. Uptake of water and nutrients are two dominant biophysical processes of crop growth while human agency, including irrigation machine power, land-preparing machine power and human labor force, determine limits of water and nutrient resources that are accessible to crops. Two crops, i.e., winter wheat and rice, which account for the majority of food crop production are considered in a rapidly developing region of the world, Jiangsu Province, China, that is witnessing the phenomenon of rural to urban migration. Its production is modeled in two steps. First water and nutrient efficiencies, defined as the ratios of observed uptake to quantities applied, are modeled as functions of labor and machine power (representing human agency). In the second step, crop yields are modeled as functions of water and nutrient efficiencies multiplied by amounts of water and fertilizers applied. As a result, crop production is predicted by first simulating water and nutrient uptake efficiencies and then determining yield as a function of water and nutrients that are actually taken up by crops. Results show that modeled relationship between water use efficiency and human agency explains 68% of observed variance for wheat and 49% for rice. The modeled relationship between nutrient use efficiency and human agency explains 49% of the variance for wheat and 56% for rice. The modeled relationships between yields and actual uptakes in the second step explain even higher percentages of observed the variance: 73% for wheat and 84% for rice. Leave-one-out cross validation of yield predictions shows that relative errors are on average within 5% of the observed yields, reinforcing the robustness of the estimated relationship and of conceptualizing crop production as a composite function of bio-physical mechanism and human agency. Interpretations based on the model reveal that after 2005, mechanization gradually led to less labor being used relative to machinery to achieve same levels of water use efficiency. Labor and irrigation equipment, on the other hand, were found to be complimentary inputs to water use efficiency. While the results suggest interventions targeting machinery are most instrumental in increasing wheat productivity, they may exasperate rural - urban migration. Policy strategies for alleviating rural-urban migration while ensuring regional food security can nonetheless be devised where appropriate data are available.

AB Synthetic data have long been employed in hydrology for model development and testing. The objective of this study was to generate a synthetic dataset of hydrologic response with higher spatial and temporal resolution than could presently be obtained in the field, spanning a longer period than the typical duration of monitoring campaigns in experimental catchments. The synthetic dataset was generated for a rangeland catchment with the Integrated Hydrology Model (InHM), and is presented for future use by the community. The InHM boundary-value problem is based upon the previously reported hypothetical reality of Tarrawarra-like hydrologic response. Whereas the emphasis in developing the hypothetical reality was on parameterising InHM to reproduce observations from the Tarrawarra catchment, the emphasis in generating the synthetic dataset is on developing an internally valid hydrologic-response dataset that extends well beyond the period of observations at Tarrawarra. The synthetic dataset spans 11 years of continuous forcing and response data (e. g. integrated response, distributed fluxes, state variable dynamics). The dataset should be useful for a wide range of problems including evaluation of simple rainfall runoff modelling techniques, design of measurement networks, development of data-assimilation algorithms, and studies on information theory.

AB Growing demand on groundwater resources and the semi-arid climate in the North China Plain (NCP) highlight the need for improved understanding of connections between regional climate change and groundwater recharge. Hydrologic time series of precipitation and groundwater levels were analyzed in three representative geographical zones throughout the NCP for the period of 1960-2008 using trend analysis and spectral analysis methods. A significant change point around 1975 is followed by a long-term decline trend in precipitation time series, which coincides with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation positive phase. However, the magnitudes of groundwater level variability due to heavy pumping overwhelm the low-frequency signal of groundwater levels. Nonlinear trends that related to long-term climatic variability and anthropogenic activities are removed by using the Singular Spectrum Analysis method. Spectral analyses of the detrended residuals demonstrate significant short-term oscillations at the frequencies of 2-7years, which have strong correlations with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation modes. This study contributes to improved understanding of dynamic relationship between groundwater and climate variability modes in the NCP and demonstrates the importance of reliable detrending methods for groundwater levels that are affected greatly by pumping.

ID VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION
AB The efficient method presented herein is based on the regularity of water flow in an open channel, which is maintained by nature at a constant ratio of mean to maximum velocities at a channel section. This ratio is a function of a parameter of a probability distribution that is equivalent to velocity distribution in the physical space. The maximum velocity can be determined quickly by measuring only a few velocities from a single vertical axis. As well as the ratio, the location of the sampling vertical axis on which the maximum velocity occurs tends to remain invariant with time. The mean velocity in a section can be rapidly determined by estimating the product of the maximum velocity multiplied by the ratio. The cross-sectional area of an open channel can be determined by the relation between gage height and area. Thus, the discharge in an open channel may be estimated as the product of mean velocity multiplied by the cross-sectional area. This efficient method can be used with any current meter to reduce the time and cost of discharge measurement in open channel flows under tidal effect. The available data of the Tanshui River downstream reach of which is in an estuarine area is used to illustrate the accuracy and reliability of the method. The results show that the simple but reliable method is capable of estimating discharge in tidal streams. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A probabilistic approach is used to simulate particle tracking for two types of porous medium. The first is sand grains with a single intergranular porosity. Particle tracking is carried out by advection and dispersion. The second is chalk granulates with intergranular and matrix porosities. Sorption can occur with advection and dispersion during particle tracking.
   Particle tracking is modelled as the sum of elementary steps with independent random variables in the sand medium. An exponential distribution is obtained for each elementary step and shows that the whole process is Markovian. A Gamma distribution or probability density function is then deduced. The relationships between dispersivity and the elementary step are given using the central limit theorem.
   Particle tracking in the chalky medium is a non-Markovian process. The probability density function depends on a power of the distance. Experimental simulations by dye tracer tests on a column have been performed for different distances and discharges.
   The probabilistic approach computations are in good agreement with the experimental data. The probabilistic computation seems an interesting and complementary approach to simulate transfer phenomena in porous media with respect to the traditional numerical methods.

ID DAM; STREAM; CE-QUAL-W2; REGIME
AB Water temperature is an important habitat factor in river ecosystems that exhibits the characteristics of continuous change. Dam construction disrupts the continuity of river water temperature and reset it, thus exerting sharp rise/decrease on the characteristics of water temperature change. The effect of a dam on river continuity is directly related to the dam size. To explain this relationship, two rivers in China were selected: one river without reservoirs and one river with cascade reservoirs. Through the analysis of the longitudinal change of water temperature in free-flowing rivers, we found that water temperature changes continuously and steadily in the longitudinal direction. Based on this, a temperature trend hypothesis in river was proposed, and the discontinuity of the water temperature in the reservoir section was evaluated. The results are as follows: (1) In mixed reservoirs, river water temperature remained as continuous as free-flowing rivers. However, the river water temperature had a large discontinuity in the stratified reservoir. (2) Water residence time was used as an indicator of the continuity of reservoir water temperature. (3) Selective withdrawal of stratified reservoirs in January could not remove the discontinuity caused by itself, but it worked in June.

TI Diagnosing Bias in Modeled Soil Moisture/Runoff Coefficient Correlation
   Using the SMAP Level 4 Soil Moisture Product
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID LAND-SURFACE MODEL; RUNOFF GENERATION; STREAMFLOW; REPRESENTATION;
   ASSIMILATION; SYSTEM; MOPEX
AB The physical parameterization of key processes in land surface models (LSMs) remains uncertain, and new techniques are required to evaluate LSMs accuracy over large spatial scales. Given the role of soil moisture in the partitioning of surface water fluxes (between infiltration, runoff, and evapotranspiration), surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates represent an important observational benchmark for such evaluations. Here, we apply SSM estimates from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-4 product (SMAP_L4) to diagnose bias in the correlation between SSM and surface runoff for multiple Noah-Multiple Physics (Noah-MP) LSM parameterization cases. Results demonstrate that Noah-MP surface runoff parameterizations often underestimate the correlation between prestorm SSM and the event-scale runoff coefficient (RC; defined as the ratio between event-scale streamflow and precipitation volumes). This bias can be quantified against an observational benchmark calculated using streamflow observations and SMAP_L4 SSM and applied to explain a substantial fraction of the observed basin-to-basin (and case-to-case) variability in the skill of event-scale RC estimates from Noah-MP. Most notably, a low bias in LSM-predicted SSM/RC correlation squanders RC information contained in prestorm SSM and reduces LSM RC estimation skill. Based on this concept, a novel case selection strategy for ungauged basins is introduced and demonstrated to successfully identify poorly performing Noah-MP parameterization cases.
   Plain Language Summary Land surface models are commonly tasked with determining what fraction of incoming rainfall infiltrates into the soil versus runs off into stream channels. The key factor determining this partitioning is the amount of water in the soil column prior to a storm event (e.g., more prestorm soil moisture is generally associated with decreased amounts of infiltration and increased surface runoff). However, due to a lack of soil moisture observations available at large scales, it has generally been difficult to assess whether existing models are accurately capturing the true relationship between prestorm soil moisture and runoff. Using newly available data from the NASA Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission, this paper demonstrates that land surface models often misrepresent the impact of prestorm surface soil moisture on runoff generation. This misrepresentation is shown to have a strong negative impact on the ability of models to accurately estimate runoff. A new calibration technique, based on the SMAP Level 4 soil moisture product, is introduced for eliminating this bias. Overall, results demonstrate how remotely sensed soil moisture can potentially play an important role in enhancing the operational forecasting of streamflow.

AB [ 1] Equations of contaminant transport describing non-Gaussian dispersion of solute in heterogeneous porous media have been developed by several authors ( e. g., Berkowitz and Scher ( 1995, 1998), Benson ( 1998, 2001), Berkowitz et al. ( 2000), and Baeumer et al. ( 2005)). The equations assume that solute particle movement in time and/or space can be described by heavy-tailed probability distributions ( e. g., Levy alpha stable distributions). This assumption requires a mechanism for solute particles to move through heterogeneous porous media in a manner that can be approximated with heavy-tailed probability distributions. This work investigates whether a heavy-tailed Levy alpha stable distribution of increments in log hydraulic conductivity results in a heavy-tailed distribution of increments in log velocity; a heavy-tailed distribution of increments in log velocity would be a mechanism for solute particle movement in time or space that can be described by a heavy-tailed probability distribution. A computer algorithm was written to generate realistic hydraulic conductivity fields. The algorithm modifies the spectral synthesis method for generating fractional Brownian motion ( i.e., Saupe ( 1988) and Brewer and Wheatcraft ( 1994)) and produces self-similar hydraulic conductivity fields with a heavy-tailed Levy alpha stable distribution of increments in log hydraulic conductivity. A Monte Carlo approach was adopted in which 100 hydraulic conductivity fields were generated for each of the following values of alpha: 0.8, 1.1, 1.4, and 1.7. The USGS finite difference groundwater code MODFLOW was used to calculate the velocity fields, and the increments in longitudinal log hydraulic conductivity and log velocity from the fields were analyzed to determine whether they were consistent with a heavy-tailed Levy alpha stable probability density function (PDF). After determining that the distributions of increments in log hydraulic conductivity and log velocity were consistent with a Levy alpha stable PDF, the tail parameters describing each pair of hydraulic conductivity and velocity fields were estimated with the Nolan ( 1997) maximum likelihood estimator. The relationship between the two tail parameters was then determined. There are three conclusions of this research. First, Mandelbrot and PP plots confirm that Levy alpha stable distributions of increments in log hydraulic conductivity give rise to Levy alpha stable distributions of increments in log velocity. Second, the tail parameter alpha for the increments in log velocity is typically smaller, indicating a heavier probability tail, than the corresponding tail parameter for the increments in log hydraulic conductivity. Third, there is a positive statistical relation between the two tail parameters.

AB Streamflow forecasts often perform poorly because of improper representation of hydrologic response timescales in underlying models. Here, we use transfer entropy (TE), which measures information flow between variables, to identify dominant drivers of discharge and their timescales using sensor data from the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed, ID, USA. Consistent with previous mechanistic studies, TE revealed that snowpack accumulation and partitioning into melt, recharge, and evaporative loss dominated discharge patterns and that snow-sourced baseflow reduced the greatest amount of uncertainty in discharge. We hypothesized that machine learning models (MLMs) specified in accordance with the dominant lag timescales, identified via TE, would outperform timescale-agnostic models. However, while lagged-variable random forest regressions captured the dominant process-seasonal snowmelt-they ultimately did not perform as well as the unlagged models, provided those models were specified with input data aggregated over a range of timescales. Unlagged models, not constrained by timescales of the dominant processes, more effectively represented variable interactions (e.g., rain-on-snow events) playing a critical role in translating precipitation into streamflow over long, intermediate, and short timescales. Meanwhile, long short-term memory (LSTM) models were effective in internally identifying the key lag and aggregation scales for predicting discharge. Parsimonious specification of LSTM models, using only daily unlagged precipitation and temperature data, produced the highest performing predictions. Our findings suggest that TE can identify dominant streamflow controls and the relative importance of different mechanisms of streamflow generation, useful for establishing process baselines and fingerprinting watersheds. However, restricting MLMs based on dominant timescales undercuts their skill at learning these timescales internally.
   Plain Language Summary Hydrologic forecast models play an important role in predicting flooding or water scarcity. However, uncertainty in model inputs such as the spatial distribution of precipitation or the amount of underground water storage all reduce the accuracy of discharge forecasts. One way to simplify the complex processes that affect riverflows is to quantify "hydrologic response times" and ensure these timescales are represented in hydrologic models. Here, we used techniques from information theory to identify important drivers of riverflows and quantify response times between water inputs and riverflows. Based on the dominant timescales identified, we formulated "informed" models to forecast riverflows but found that the informed models outperformed baseline models only for a limited set of conditions. Rather, specialized machine learning models that "learn" a spectrum of response times between predictors and riverflow, representing timescales of both dominant and subordinate processes affecting riverflow, achieved the best predictive performance. Moreover, the models performed well using only precipitation and temperature data-both widely available-as inputs. This finding suggested that these models could perform well for forecasting streamflow in both gauged and ungauged basins.

AB Streamflow in Australia's northern rivers has been steadily increasing since the 1970s, most likely due to increased intensity in the Indo-Australian monsoon. However, because of limited data availability, it is hard to assess this recent trend and therefore contextualize potential future climatic changes. In this study, we used a network of 63 precipitation-sensitive tree-ring chronologies from the Indo-Australian and Asian monsoon regions to reconstruct streamflow in the Daly catchment in the Northern Territory of Australia from 1413 to 2005 CE. We used a novel wavelet-based method to transform the variance structure of the tree-ring chronologies to better match the hydroclimate prior to reconstruction with a hierarchical Bayesian regression model. Our streamflow reconstruction accounts for 72%-78% of the variance in the instrumental period and closely matches both historical flood events and independent proxy records, increasing confidence in its validity. We find that while streamflow has been increasing since the 1800s, the most recent 40-year period is unprecedented in the last similar to 600 years. Comparison to an independent coral-based streamflow record shows regional coherency in this trend. Extreme high flows were found to be linked to La Nina events, but we found no significant relationship between streamflow and El Nino events, or streamflow and other regional climatic drivers. More work is therefore needed to understand the drivers of the recent streamflow increase, but, regardless of the cause, water managers should be aware of the paleoclimatic context before making decisions on water allocations.
   Plain Language Summary Large-scale agricultural development has been proposed for the Daly catchment in the Northern Territory of Australia. Since the start of record keeping in the Daly catchment in the 1970s, streamflow has been steadily increasing, most likely due to increases in Australian monsoon rainfall. However, because of the limited amount of data, it is hard to assess whether this recent increase in streamflow is unusual, part of a longer trend, or a natural cycle in monsoon rainfall. In this study, we used rainfall-sensitive tree growth and a statistical model to reconstruct Daly River streamflow over the past 592 years. Our streamflow reconstruction closely matches known past flood events, increasing confidence in its validity. We find that streamflow has increased since the 1800s but that the most recent 40-year period is unprecedented in the last 600 years. More work is needed to understand the drivers of this increased streamflow but regardless of the cause, water managers should be aware of the Daly River's history before making decisions on allocating water to agriculture or other large users.

AB The effects of calcite precipitation on porous media permeability and flow were evaluated with a combined experimental and modeling approach. X-ray microtomography images of two columns packed with glass beads and calcite (spar crystals) or aragonite (Bahamas ooids) injected with a supersaturated solution (log Omega = 1.42) were processed in order to calculate rates of calcite precipitation with a spatial resolution of 4.46 mu m. Identification and localization of the newly precipitated crystals on the 3D images was performed and results used to calculate the crystal growth rates and velocities. The effects of carbonate precipitation were also evaluated in terms of the integrated precipitation rate over the length of the column, crystal shape, surface area and pore roughness changes. While growth was epitaxial on calcite spar, calcite rhombohedra formed on glass beads and clusters of polyhedrons formed on aragonite ooids. Near the column inlet, calcite precipitation occurred preferentially on carbonate grains compared to glass beads, with almost 100% of calcite spar surface area covered by new crystals versus 92% in the case of aragonite and 11% in the case of glass beads. Although the experimental chemistry and flow boundary conditions in the two columns were similar, their porosity-permeability evolution was different because the nucleation and subsequent crystal growth on the two substrates (i.e., calcite spar and aragonite ooids) was very different. The impact of mineral precipitation on pore-scale flow and permeability was evaluated using a pore-scale Stokes solver that accounted for the changes in pore geometry. For similar magnitude reductions in porosity, the decrease in permeability was highest within the sample that experienced the greatest increase in pore roughness. Various porous media models weregenerated to show the impact of different crystal growth patterns and pore roughness changes on flow and permeability-porosity relationship. Under constant flow rate boundary conditions, precipitation resulted in an increase in both the average and maximum velocities. Increases in, pore roughness led to a more heterogeneous flow field, principally through the effects on the fastest and slowest velocities within the domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, climatology, variability, hydrological impact, and climatic drivers of atmospheric rivers (ARs) are widely explored based on various AR identification algorithms. Different algorithms, varying in their tracing variables, thresholds, and geometric metrics criteria, will introduce uncertainty in further study of AR. Herein, a novel AR identification algorithm is proposed to address some current limitations. A coupled quantile and Gaussian kernel smoothing technique is proposed to make a balance in capturing the spatiotemporal variation of integrated water vapor transport climatology and avoiding largely biased estimation. In spite of variety of AR shape, orientation, and curvature, more reliable AR metrics (e.g., length and width) can be calculated based on the generated smooth AR trajectory, which is realized by modifying and integrating the concepts of local regression and K-nearest neighbors. An unprecedented and novel metric (i.e., turning angle series) is delivered to quantify AR curvature, serves as the key to distinguish tropical cyclone-like features, which often indicate occurrences of tropical cyclones. It also bridges ARs to their associated atmospheric circulation patterns. A pilot application of the algorithm is presented to identify persistent AR events related to flood triggering extreme precipitation sequences in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). A dominating AR route, which connects Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, South China Sea, to Southeast China and YRB, terminates in the North Pacific, is found principal to the flood triggering extreme precipitation sequences in the YRB. In addition, this algorithm is extensible to other regions, even global domain.
   Plain Language Summary Atmospheric rivers (ARs), which are characterized as long and narrow corridors in the lower atmosphere that transport moisture, have received a lot of attention in many regions, mainly because of their close relationship with hydrometeorological extremes (e.g., heavy rainfall and flooding). Several AR identification algorithms based on different proxies were developed for different regions; however, uncertainty and limitations still exist. We present a novel AR identification algorithm to address some of these limitations to aid in the understanding and prediction of AR. In spite of varying AR shape, orientation, and curvature, this algorithm provides more robust AR detection threshold, smooth AR trajectory, and reliable AR geometric features. In particular, it offers a novel AR metric (i.e., turning angle series) to differentiate tropical cyclone-like features from ARs and build a linkage between AR and atmospheric circulation patterns, which is unprecedented in AR studies. As a demonstration of the algorithm, we identify the associated AR events during flood triggering extreme precipitation sequences in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). A dominating AR route, which connects Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, South China Sea, to Southeast China and YRB, terminates in the North Pacific, is found principal to the flood triggering extreme precipitation sequences in YRB.

AB Reservoir construction greatly affects the regional ecological environment, particularly surface water-groundwater interactions around the reservoir. Xiluodu Reservoir, a representative large-scale reservoir in China, has had substantial impacts on surface water-groundwater interactions at the dam site since impoundment. This study analysed the dynamic characteristics of surface water-groundwater level, temperature, and hydrochemistry to determine the evolution of surface water-groundwater interaction before and after the impoundment. The levels of groundwater and some surface water rose by more than 100 m after impoundment and the water level of saturated limestone gradually stabilized, whereas basalt saturation in the affected area continued to expand. The groundwater temperature did not decrease significantly, whereas the hydrochemical types and ion contents of both surface water and groundwater experienced significant changes. Calculation of the saturation index indicated spatiotemporal changes in the saturation state of minerals. The replenishment source of each type of water and their mutual relationships were determined using cluster analysis and isotope characteristics. The results confirmed continuous, significant, and variable surface water-groundwater interactions at the dam site, which were partially reversed after impoundment. Changes in surface water-groundwater interactions were due to impoundment, the impact of which decreases with distance from the dam, as well as the unique geological conditions and artificial construction.

AB This paper investigates suspended sediment transport and dynamics of two nested agricultural lowland Mediterranean catchments with a difference of two orders of magnitude in the surface area (i.e., 1 and 264km(2)). The effects of the drainage catchment area over the specific suspended sediment yield are assessed by using the nested approach over various timeframes. A detailed analysis of the rainfall-runoff-sediment transport relationships during the 2-year study period shows that the hydrological and sedimentological responses were extremely variable for both catchments. Very low or no correlations were observed between the rainfall intensity and the selected hydrological variables and sediment loads. However, remarkable or high correlations were obtained between the rainfall intensity and the maximum and average suspended sediment concentrations, indicating that rainfall per unit time has little control on the hydrological response, but that, simultaneously, its high-erosive power triggers sediment production, increasing the sedimentary response of the catchments. This study also illustrates how sediment is mainly transported during floods, producing predominantly clockwise hysteretic loops. Moreover, the small headwater catchment exerts a reduced (or even negligible) effect over the hydro-sedimentary response of the larger downstream catchment, caused by the reduced sediment availability in a landscape with an inherent disconnection of the sediment pathways.

TI Anisotropy, lacunarity, and upscaled conductivity and its autocovariance
   in multiscale random fields with truncated power variograms

AB It has been shown by Di Federico and Neuman [1997, 1998a, b] that observed multiscale behaviors of subsurface fluid flow and transport variables can be explained within the context of a unified stochastic framework, which views hydraulic conductivity as a random fractal characterized by a power variogram. Such a random field is statistically nonhomogeneous but possesses homogeneous spatial increments. Di Federico and Neuman [1997] have demonstrated that the power variogram and associated spectra of a statistically isotropic fractal field can be constructed as a weighted integral from zero to infinity (an infinite hierarchy) of exponential or Gaussian variograms and spectra of mutually uncorrelated fields (modes) that are homogeneous and isotropic. We show in this paper that the same holds true when the field and its constituent modes are statistically anisotropic, provided the ratios between principal integral (spatial correlation) scales are the same for all modes. We then analyze the effect of filtering out (truncating) modes of low, high, and intermediate spatial frequency from this infinite hierarchy in the real and spectral domains. A low-frequency cutoff renders the truncated hierarchy homogeneous. The integral scales of the lowest- and highest-frequency cutoff modes are related to length scales of the sampling window (domain) and data support (sample volume), respectively. Taking the former to be proportional to the latter renders expressions for the integral scale and variance of the truncated field dependent on window and support scale (in a manner previously shown to be consistent with observations in the isotropic case). It also allows (in principle) bridging across scales at a specific locale, as well as among locales, by adopting either site-specific or generalized variogram parameters. The introduction of intermediate cutoffs allows us to account, in a straightforward manner, for lacunarity due to gaps in the multiscale hierarchy created by the absence of modes associated with discrete ranges of scales (for example, where textural and structural features are associated with distinct ranges of scale, such as fractures having discrete ranges of trace length and density, which dissect the rock into matrix blocks having corresponding ranges of sizes). We explore mathematically and graphically the effects that anisotropy and lacunarity have on the integral scale, variance, covariance, and spectra of a truncated fractal field. We then develop an expression for the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of a box-shaped porous block, embedded within a multiscale log hydraulic conductivity field, under mean-uniform flow. The block is larger than the support scale of the field but is smaller than a surrounding sampling window. Consequently, its equivalent hydraulic conductivity is a random variable whose variance and spatial autocorrelation function, conditioned on a known mean value of support-scale conductivity across the window, are given explicitly by our multiscale theory.

TI Vegetation impact on mean annual evapotranspiration at a global

AB Research into the role of catchment vegetation within the hydrologic cycle has a long history in the hydrologic literature. Relationships between vegetation type and catchment evapotranspiration and runoff were primarily assessed through paired catchment studies during the 20th century. Results from over 200 paired catchment studies from around the world have been reported in the literature. Two constraints on utilizing the results from paired catchment studies in the wider domain have been that the catchment areas studied are generally (1) small (<10 km(2)) and (2) from a narrow range of climate types. The majority of reported paired catchment studies are located in the USA (similar to 47%) and Australia (similar to 27%) and experience mainly temperate (Koppen C) and cold (Koppen D) climate types. In this paper we assess the impact of vegetation type on mean annual evapotranspiration through a large, spatially, and climatically diverse data set of 699 catchments from around the world. These catchments are a subset of 861 unregulated catchments considered for the analysis. Spatially averaged precipitation and temperature data, in conjunction with runoff and land cover information, are analyzed to draw broad conclusions about the vegetation impact on mean annual evapotranspiration. In this analysis any vegetation impact signal is assessed through differences in long-term catchment average actual evapotranspiration, defined as precipitation minus runoff, between catchments grouped by vegetation type. This methodology differs from paired catchment studies where vegetation impact is assessed through streamflow responses to a controlled, within catchment, land cover change. The importance of taking the climate type experienced by the catchments into account when assessing the vegetation impact on evapotranspiration is demonstrated. Tropical and temperate forested catchments are found to have statistically significant higher median evapotranspiration, by about 170 mm and 130 mm, respectively, than non-forested catchments. Unexpectedly, cold forested catchments exhibit significantly lower median evapotranspiration, by about 90 mm, than non-forested catchments. No significant difference was found between median evapotranspiration of temperate evergreen and deciduous forested catchments though sample sizes were small. Temperate evergreen needleleaf forested catchments were found to have significantly higher median evapotranspiration than evergreen broadleaf forested catchments though sample sizes were small. The significant temperate forest versus non-forest difference in median evapotranspiration was found to persist for catchments with areas <1,000 km(2), but not for catchments with areas >= 1,000 km(2), which is consistent with the suggestion that the vegetation impact on evapotranspiration diminishes as catchment area increases. In summary, the results presented here are consistent with those drawn from reviews of paired catchment results. However, this paper demonstrates the value of a diverse hydroclimatic data set when assessing the vegetation impact on evapotranspiration as the magnitude of impact is observed to vary across climate types.

TI Analysis of the Vibration Modes of Impact Geoplates and Implications for

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB Seismic geophones have been frequently used in combination with metal plates to indirectly estimate bedload flux in gravel bed mountain rivers. This indirect method has been calibrated with direct measurements in several conditions and proved effective to provide relevant information on spatial and temporal scales otherwise impossible to explore. Notwithstanding, a detailed description of the vibration modes of the plate is still lacking, limiting the possibility to interpret the signal. Here, we report on two sets of experiments where we explored the geoplate response in terms of frequency and amplitude of different vibrational modes. A first set of dry experiments was designed to investigate the variability of the signal as a function of the impact location on the plate. A second set reproduced standard flow conditions, with single pebbles transported by the flow. Results highlighted the occurrence of two main vibration modes, with a first rapid phase (about 5 ms) characterized by higher frequencies, and a second longer and more stable phase of vibration with a frequency in the range of 300-400 Hz. The signal of single impacts showed a good correlation with pebble mass, with only the number of impacts on the plate depending on the flow conditions. The evaluation of the grain size is a challenge given the variability of the signal generated by similar impacts. We propose a filtering strategy to improve grain size estimation. Our analysis shows that a more detailed understanding of the vibrational modes helps identifying best practices for an improved signal acquisition and elaboration.
   Plain Language Summary Vibration produced by sediments transported on the riverbed can be used to indirectly estimate sediment flux in rivers. A commonly used method involves the installation of metal plates on the riverbed. Their vibration is measured by geophones and converted into metrics related to sediment flux. In this work, we performed laboratory experiments to better understand the vibration modes of the plate, measuring the frequency and amplitude of the different harmonics through a Fourier analysis. In a first set of experiments, we investigated the variability of the signal as a function of the hitting spot on the plate, in dry conditions. A second set reproduced standard flow conditions, with single particles transported by the flow. Results showed that the plate vibrates mainly with its natural frequency (about 350 Hz), with higher frequencies related to higher vibration modes damping very rapidly. Particles hit the plate one or more times, generating impacts with amplitudes related mainly to their mass, whereas the number of impacts also depends on the flow conditions. Filtering the impacts as a function of their vibration spectra may result in more accurate relationships between the recorded signal and sediment flux and may help designing improved signal acquisition and elaboration tools.

AB The global decline of water quality in rivers and streams has resulted in a pressing need to design new watershed management strategies. Water quality can be affected by multiple stressors including population growth, land use change, global warming, and extreme events, with repercussions on human and ecosystem health. A scientific understanding of factors affecting riverine water quality and predictions at local to regional scales, and at sub-daily to decadal timescales are needed for optimal management of watersheds and river basins. Here, we discuss how machine learning (ML) can enable development of more accurate, computationally tractable, and scalable models for analysis and predictions of river water quality. We review relevant state-of-the art applications of ML for water quality models and discuss opportunities to improve the use of ML with emerging computational and mathematical methods for model selection, hyperparameter optimization, incorporating process knowledge into ML models, improving explainablity, uncertainty quantification, and model-data integration. We then present considerations for using ML to address water quality problems given their scale and complexity, available data and computational resources, and stakeholder needs. When combined with decades of process understanding, interdisciplinary advances in knowledge-guided ML, information theory, data integration, and analytics can help address fundamental science questions and enable decision-relevant predictions of riverine water quality.

AB Prescribed fire is an important tool for rangeland management in sage-steppe ecosystems, yet the long-term effects of this practice on soil hydraulic properties are not well known. We explore interactions among site geomorphology, soil organic carbon (SOC) soil N, soil water repellency (SWR), and plant community type on infiltration properties before fire and 8 years thereafter in a semiarid research watershed. The objective was to assess the sustainability of rangeland burning in sage-steppe ecosystems. Many types of measurements were made in three plant communities to identify how differences in soil hydraulic properties are related to differences in plant cover and soil texture and to determine relationships among SOC, SWR, soil water contact angle, and infiltration properties. Measurements were made on transects in burned and unburned catchments. We found that severity and occurrence of surface SWR were substantially reduced 8 years after a fire within the area originally covered with mountain big sagebrush, where the fire intensity was greatest. Surface SWR was lowest in the sparsely vegetated low sagebrush, where SOC was also lowest. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-h) increased in each vegetation type over the 8-year period after burning and was not directly related to SWR. Spatial variability in K-h was primarily controlled by soil texture, whereas differences in sorptivity (S) were controlled by SWR and aridity. SOC is not well correlated to soil surface SWR. The decadal scale changes in K-h and associations between S and site characteristics indicate forms of resilience to fire across a moisture gradient.
   Plain Language Summary Wildfire that removes vegetation can alter soil surfaces and result in erosion. Vegetation succession patterns in grazed lands can accelerate the rangeland fire cycle and alter soil properties including infiltration and organic carbon storage. This study investigated evolving interactions between soil properties and rangeland plant ecosystems from prefire conditions until 8-year postfire to clarify the changes in soil infiltration capacity. This information is intended to guide land managers who use prescribed fires to manage rangelands to limit the incidence of catastrophic fires and erosion. We found that the severity and presence of surface soil water repellency were greatly reduced 8 years after treatment in the Aspen stand, where the surface was manually burned. Although postfire decreases in soil water repellency were modest at in the big mountain sagebrush, the postfire infiltration capacity was at least twice as great as prior measurements. This indicates a positive long-term effect of prescribed fire control of big mountain sagebrush at the study site.

AB Non-stationarity in extreme precipitation at sub-daily and daily timescales is assessed using a spatial extreme value model based on max-stable process theory. This approach, which was developed to simulate spatial fields comprising observations from multiple point locations, significantly increases the precision of a statistical inference compared to standard univariate methods. Applying the technique to a field of annual maxima derived from 30 sub-daily gauges in east Australia from 1965 to 2005, we find a statistically significant increase of 18% for 6-min rainfall over this period, with smaller increases for longer duration events. We also find an increase of 5.6% and 22.5% per degree of Australian land surface temperature and global sea surface temperature at 6-min durations, respectively, again with smaller scaling relationships for longer durations. In contrast, limited change could be observed in daily rainfall at most locations, with the exception of a statistically significant decline of 7.4% per degree land surface temperature in southwest Western Australia. These results suggest both the importance of better understanding changes to precipitation at the sub-daily timescale, as well as the need to more precisely simulate temporal variability by accounting for the spatial nature of precipitation in the statistical model.

AB Sustainable water use is in serious crisis in the piedmont region of the Taihang Mountains in the North China Plain, owing to rapid groundwater drawdown. Estimating the water requirement for agriculture, the biggest user of groundwater, will be helpful in understanding groundwater decline. Through the use of DSSAT-3-5 wheat and maize models, we assessed water use in winter wheat and maize, two staple crops in the region, in 1987-2001. Trends between groundwater change and simulated agricultural water use were compared. The results showed that groundwater decline was sensitive to simulated crop water requirement and irrigation requirement. According to regression analysis, 100 mm. of water requirement by cultivated land (mainly wheat and maize) resulted in about 0.64 m of groundwater decline. This relationship might be useful in understanding the regional water balance and to help decision-makers control groundwater decline through controlling crop water use or through long-distance water transfer. The study demonstrated the usefulness of using the DSSAT model for estimating crop water use and the effectiveness of clarifying the reason for groundwater decline using the simulation results of water use.

AB Flow disturbances generated by individual patches of submerged, flexible aquatic vegetation were investigated for two naturally growing macrophyte species, Potamogeton crispus L. and Myriophyllum spicatum L., in a sandy lowland river. Through acoustic Doppler velocimetry, 24 vertical profiles of the 3D velocity field were recorded downstream of each of the patches. The morphological features and biomechanical properties of the plants were also evaluated. The experiments showed the relationship between biomechanical characteristics and turbulence statistics. M. spicatum, which was stiffer and therefore less prone to dynamic reconfiguration, showed a greater effect on velocity damping, causing an increase in Reynold stresses, turbulence intensities, and turbulent kinetic energy downstream of the patch. These effects were present in regions both above and below plant height. In contrast for P. crispus, these effects were present only below plant height. The stiffer plant produced a mixing layer in its wake similar to that of dense plant canopies. The patch of less stiff and more streamlined P. crispus with longer leaves presented a much weaker effect on the flow. In contrast to previous studies conducted with rigid plant surrogates, we concluded that reconfiguration of the living flexible plants allows the plants to minimize drag forces, and therefore, their influence on the flow field was weaker than the effects reported for rigid surrogates.

AB The urban environment modifies the hydrologic cycle resulting in increased runoff rates, volumes, and peak flows. Green infrastructure, which uses best management practices (BMPs), is a natural system approach used to mitigate the impacts of urbanization onto stormwater runoff. Patterns of stormwater runoff from urban environments are complex, and it is unclear how efficiently green infrastructure will improve the urban water cycle. These challenges arise from issues of scale, the merits of BMPs depend on changes to small-scale hydrologic processes aggregated up from the neighborhood to the urban watershed. Here, we use a hyper-resolution (1m), physically based hydrologic model of the urban hydrologic cycle with explicit inclusion of the built environment. This model represents the changes to hydrology at the BMP scale (similar to 1m) and represents each individual BMP explicitly to represent response over the urban watershed. Our study varies both the percentage of BMP emplacement and their spatial location for storm events of increasing intensity in an urban watershed. We develop a metric of effectiveness that indicates a nonlinear relationship that is seen between percent BMP emplacement and storm intensity. Results indicate that BMP effectiveness varies with spatial location and that type and emplacement within the urban watershed may be more important than overall percent.

AB [1] Differential effective medium (DEM) theory is presented and used to calculate the effective HF dielectric permittivity k of unsaturated soils considered as mixtures of solid and two fluid phases. In the case of coarse-grained soils for which dielectric losses are negligible, a good agreement with the empirical equation of Topp et al. [ 1980] is obtained using only a spherical grain shape. Moreover, results of DEM schemes have shown that ohmic losses induced by salinity modify significantly the relationship between the apparent dielectric permittivity at 120 MHz and the volumetric water content theta, for NaCl concentration greater than 0.045 mol/L. In the case of clayey soils, simulations based on the same theoretical approach show that the available data can not be modeled by considering only the geometrical effect associated with the "platy'' units and the ohmic losses associated with the surface conductivity.

AB This study involved a baseline evaluation of fluvial carbon export and degas rates in three nested rural catchments (1 to 80 km(2)) in Taboao, a representative experimental catchment of the Upper Uruguay River Basin. Analyses of the carbon content in stream waters and the catchment carbon yield were based on 4-year monthly in situ data and statistical modeling using the United States Geological Survey load estimator model. We also estimated pCO(2) and degas fluxes using carbonate equilibrium and gas-exchange formulas. Our results indicated that the water was consistently pCO2 saturated (similar to 90% of the cases) and that the steep terrain favors high gas evasion rates. The mean calculated fluvial export was 5.4 tC.km(-2).year(-1) with inorganic carbon dominating (dissolved inorganic carbon: dissolved organic carbon ratio >4), and degas rates (similar to 40 tC.km(-2).year(-1)) were nearly sevenfold higher than the downstream export. The homogeneous land use in this nested catchment system results in similar water-quality characteristics, and therefore, export rates are expected to be closely related to the rainfall-runoff relationships at each scale. Although the sampling campaigns did not fully reproduce storm-event conditions and related effects such as flushing or dilution of in-stream carbon, our results indicated a potential link between dissolved inorganic carbon and slower hydrological pathways related to subsurface water storage and movement.

AB Pore network model simulation (PNM) is an important method to simulate reactive transport processes in porous media and to investigate constitutive relationships between permeability and porosity that can be implemented in continuum-scale reactive-transport modeling. The existing reactive transport pore network models (rtPNMs) assume that the initially cylindrical pore throats maintain their shape and pore throat conductance is updated using a form of Hagen-Poiseuille relation. However, in the context of calcite dissolution, earlier studies have shown that during dissolution, pore throats can attain a spectrum of shapes, depending upon the imposed reactive-flow conditions (Agrawal et al., 2020). In the current study, we derived new constitutive relations for the calculation of conductance as a function of pore throat volume and shape evolution for a range of imposed flow and reaction conditions. These relations were used to build animproved new reactive pore network model (nrtPNM). Using the new model, the porosity-permeability changes were simulated and compared against the existing pore network models.
   In order to validate the reactive transport pore network model, we conducted two sets of flow-through experiments on two Ketton limestone samples. Acidic solutions (pH 3.0) were injected at two Darcy velocities i.e., 7.3 x 10(-4) and 1.5 x 10(-4) m.s(-1) while performing X-ray micro-CT scanning. Experimental values of the changes in sample permeability were estimated in two independent ways: through PNM flow simulation and through Direct Numerical Simulation. Both approaches used images of the samples from the beginning and the end of experiments. Extracted pore networks, obtained from the micro-CT images of the sample from the beginning of the experiment, were used for reactive transport PNMs (rtPNM and nrtPNM).
   We observed that for the experimental conditions, most of the pore throats maintained the initially prescribed cylindrical shape such that both rtPNM and nrtPNM showed a similar evolution of porosity and permeability. This was found to be in reasonable agreement with the porosity and permeability changes observed in the experiment. Next, we have applied a range of flow and reaction regimes to compare permeability evolutions between rtPNM and nrtPNM. We found that for certain dissolution regimes, neglecting the evolution of the pore throat shape in the pore network can lead to an overestimation of up to 27% in the predicted permeability values and an overestimation of over 50% in the fitted exponent for the porosity-permeability relations. In summary, this study showed that while under high flow rate conditions the rtPNM model is accurate enough, it overestimates permeability under lower flow rates.

AB Socio-hydrology advanced the field of hydrology by considering humans and their activities as part of the water cycle, rather than as external drivers. Models are used to infer reproducible trends in human interactions with water resources. However, defining and handling water problems in this way may restrict the scope of such modeling approaches. We propose an interdisciplinary socio-hydrological approach to overcome this limit and complement modeling approaches. It starts from concrete field-based situations, combines disciplinary as well as local knowledge on water-society relationships, with the aim of broadening the hydrocentric analysis and modeling of water systems. The paper argues that an analysis of social dynamics linked to water is highly complementary to traditional hydrological tools but requires a negotiated and contextualized interdisciplinary approach to the representation and analysis of socio-hydro systems. This reflection emerged from experience gained in the field where a water-budget modeling framework failed to adequately incorporate the multiplicity of (nonhydrological) factors that determine the volumes of withdrawals for irrigation. The pathway subsequently explored was to move away from the hydrologic view of the phenomena and, in collaboration with social scientists, to produce a shared conceptualization of a coupled human-water system through a negotiated approach. This approach changed the way hydrological research issues were addressed and limited the number of strong assumptions needed for simplification in modeling. The proposed socio-hydrological approach led to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind local water-related problems and to debates on the interactions between social and political decisions and the dynamics of these problems.
   Plain Language Summary This paper provides a collective reflection on the ways to articulate an understanding of social dynamics within hydrological approaches, based on interdisciplinary experience gained in the field in North Africa. Fundamentally, the socio-hydrological approach proposed here enabled a better understanding of the mechanisms behind human-water dynamics and hence of the impacts of social and political decisions on future changes. The major shift in this interdisciplinary approach is that it provides evidence that things do not simply interact in a positive or negative way, but also combine and shape together. So we need to look for pragmatic ways to link the analysis of social dynamics with the understanding of the hydrological processes. This requires hydrology to open up further to different approaches and methods used in other scientific disciplines, especially human sciences. This could lead to a radically innovative way of conceiving and representing coupled human-water systems.

AB Water regime characteristics have been recognized as critical factors for aquatic vegetation. In this study, we examined changes in aquatic vegetation coverage area in two shallow sub-lakes of Poyang Lake (Bang Lake and Cuoji Lake) during the dry season from 1987 to 2017. The relationships between eight water regime components (annual average water level, annual maximum water level, annual minimum water level, and flooded days at five water levels [11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 m]) and aquatic vegetation coverage area were determined. The most critical water regimes were identified and results demonstrated that aquatic vegetation coverage area in Bang Lake and Cuoji Lake peaked in drier years (2005 and 2009, respectively) with no obvious up or down trend. Water regimes indicating high flow events such as annual maximum water level, flooded days at water level 19 m, and annual average water level were found to be more important for predicting aquatic vegetation. High-flow events appear to be essential for understanding aquatic vegetation dynamics in pit lakes, yet overall the influences of water level fluctuation on aquatic vegetation varied among wetland units of Poyang Lake. This study helps to understand the hydroecological dynamics in connected lakes further and provide a reference for the lake management and protection.

AB Snow accumulation in mountain headwater basins is a major water source, particularly in semi-arid environments such as southern Alberta where water resources are stressed and snowmelt supplies more than 80% of downstream runoff. Relationships between landscape predictor variables and snow water equivalent (SWE) were quantified by combining field and LiDar measurements with classification and regression tree analysis over two winter seasons (2010 and 2011) in a small, montane watershed. 2010 was a below average snow accumulation year, while 2011 was well above normal. In both the field and regression tree data, elevation was the dominant control on snow distribution in both years, although snow distribution was driven by melt processes in 2010 and accumulation processes in 2011. The importance of solar radiation and wind exposure was represented in the regression trees in both years. The regression trees also noted the lower importance of canopy closure, slope, and aspect, which was not observed in the field data. This technique could provide an additional method of forecasting annual water supply from melting snow. However, further research is required to address the lack of data collected above treeline, to provide a full-basin estimate of SWE. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Although the identification of the moisture sources of a region is of prominent importance to characterize precipitation, the origin and amount of moisture towards the Indian Subcontinent and its relationship with the occurrence of precipitation are still not completely understood. In this article, the origin of the atmospheric water arriving to the Western and Southern India during a period of 5?years (1 January 200031 December 2004) is investigated by using a Lagrangian diagnosis method. This methodology computes budgets of evaporation minus precipitation by calculating changes in the specific humidity of thousands of air particles aimed to the study area following the observed winds. During the summer monsoon, the main supply of moisture is the Somali Jet, which crosses the equator by the West Indian Ocean. The recycling process is the main water vapour source in winter. Two additional moisture sources located over northwestern India and the Bay of Bengal are identified. A 30% increase in the moisture flux from the Indian Ocean has been related to the occurrence of strong precipitation in the area, and at the end of the monsoon, the recycling became a significant contribution to the last part of the wet season of Western and Southern India.

ID SEDIMENT YIELD
AB Infiltration excess overland flow has been identified as the dominant flow pathway in recently reclaimed surface mined watersheds as a result of compaction and sorting during the reclamation procedure. Therefore, there could be a fairly direct relationship between runoff generated from the hillslopes to that measured at the watershed outlet. A 3-year study was initiated in 1993 to determine how well surface runoff at a watershed scale could be predicted from 1-m(2) runoff frames placed on hillslopes in two reclaimed surface-mined watersheds in central Alberta. Runoff from the hillslope frames suggests outlet discharge should be high from the 3.4-ha Sandy Subsoil Watershed and much less for the 9.8-ha West Watershed, but the opposite occurred. Most of the hillslope runoff from the Sandy Subsoil Watershed infiltrated once it reached the channel and depression storage played an insignificant role in determining runoff. In contrast, most of the runoff from the West Watershed originated from rain falling directly on the saturated channel (depression storage) or near-channel saturated areas, rather than the hillslopes. Neither watershed runoff magnitude nor timing could be predicted from the same parameters for hillslope runoff frames for either reclaimed watershed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Earlier researches have proposed algorithms to quantify the measurement uncertainty in rating curves and found that the magnitude of the uncertainty can be significant enough to impact hydrologic modeling. Therefore, they suggested frameworks to include measurement uncertainty in the rating curve to make it robust. Despite their efforts, a robust rating curve is often ignored in traditional practices, considering the investment of time and money as well as the resulting benefit from it. In the current research, we are interested in understanding the role of the measurement error variance in real-time streamflow forecasting. Our objectives are (i) to employ a state-of-the-art statistical forecasting model that can handle measurement uncertainty in daily streamflow and (ii) to understand the trade-off in forecasting performance when substantial knowledge regarding the measurement uncertainty is provided to the modeler. We apply the Bayesian dynamic hierarchical model (BDHM) on four gauging sites in the United States. Results show that the BDHM performs better than the daily climatology and local linear regression model. Also, the forecast variance changes proportionally with the change in the error variance as an input in the observation equation. Following this, we design a simulation-based study, which assigns the measurement error in the reported streamflow to obtain multiple realizations of the true streamflow. The inclusion of substantial knowledge about the true error improves the BDHM's performance by lowering the CRPS (continuous rank probability score) values. However, the inclusion increases the forecast variance to bring the true streamflow within the sampling variability of the forecasted streamflow. Overall, an improved trade-off between the success rate of forecasts and the forecast variance can be achieved by including the measurement error in the BDHM for rivers that witness less dispersed streamflow data.
   Plain Language Summary Rating curve uncertainty is one of the major sources of measurement uncertainty in reported streamflow. It occurs when a precalibrated stage-discharge relationship curve is used to indirectly measure the streamflow volume based on river stage measurement. Considering the cost and time involved to include the uncertainty in reported streamflow, rating curve uncertainty is often ignored in traditional streamflow modeling practices. The current study adopts a state-of-the-art statistical model that can include rating curve uncertainty while issuing daily streamflow forecasts 1 to 3 days in advance. The study found that a proper knowledge of rating curve uncertainty at a gauge site significantly improves the forecasting of true streamflow.
   Key Points
   Bayesian dynamic hierarchical model (BDHM) can include the measurement uncertainty that has a substantial impact on real-time forecasting BDHM efficiently predicts the reported streamflow 1 to 3 days in advance while compared with the daily climatology and a semiparametric forecasting model Knowledge of the measurement uncertainty improves the overall performance of BDHM in predicting the true streamflows

AB This study combines neural networks and fuzzy arithmetic to present a counterpropagation fuzzy-neural network (CFNN) for streamflow reconstruction. The CFNN has a rule-based control, a modified self-organizing counterpropagation network, and a fuzzy control predictor. It can generate rules automatically by increasing the training data to improve the accuracy or streamflow reconstruction. The CFNN establishes the input and output relationship of a watershed without set-up parameters. The parameters are estimated systematically by the approach converging to an optimal solution. One sequence of data generated by the Monte Carlo method is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the CFNN. The streamflow data of the Da-chia River, in central Taiwan, is also used to evaluate the performances of the CFNN. The results indicate the reliability and accuracy of the CFNN for streamflow reconstruction. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Design parameters for urban drainage systems in Belgium have been revised. The revision involves extrapolation of the design rainfall statistics, taking into account the current knowledge on future climate change trends till 2100. Uncertainties in these trend projections have been assessed after statistically analysing and downscaling a broad ensemble set of 44 regional and 69 global climate model runs. Climate change scenarios were developed, tailored for the application of urban drainage impact analysis. By means of a further advanced quantile perturbation method, a 100-year 10-min historical rainfall series was perturbed for each climate change scenario. The perturbations were based on the empirical frequency distributions for the lower return periods, and calibrated extreme value distributions for the higher return periods.
   Based on the climate scenarios and perturbed historical rainfall series, changes in intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) statistics and design storms have been derived. It was shown that the 10-year design storm intensity can increase up to about 50% by the end of this century. Or, systems currently designed for a 20-year return period of flooding, might flood with a mean recurrence interval of - in order of magnitude - 5 years by the end of the century. Based on a continuous reservoir simulation approach, changes in overflow frequency of storage facilities have been quantified for a wide range of storage capacities and infiltration/throughflow rates. It is found that increase in storage capacity of 11-51% is required to keep the overflow frequency to the current level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological modelling is a complicated procedure and there are many tough questions facing, all modellers: what input data Should be used? how much data is required? and what model should be used? In this paper, the gamma test (GT) has been used for the first little in modelling one of the key hydrological components: solar radiation. The study aimed to resolve the questions about the relative importance of input variables and to determine the optimum number of data points required 10 construct a reliable smooth model. The proposed methodology has been Studied through the estimation of daily solar radiation in the Brue Catchment. the UK. The relationship between input and Output in the meteorological data sets was achieved through error variance estimation before the modelling using the GT. This work has demonstrated how the GT helps model development in nonlinear modelling techniques such as local linear regression (LLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN). It was found that the GT provides very useful information for input data selection and Subsequent model development. The study has wider implications for various hydrological modelling practices and suggests further exploration of this technique for improving informed data and model selection, which has been a difficult field in hydrology in past decades.

AB Diurnal variations in discharge and suspended sediment concentration (SSC), including runoff delaying characteristics, have been studied for the Gangotri Glacier, the largest glacier in the Garhwal Himalayas (glacierized area 286 km(2); drainage area 556 km(2)). Hourly discharge and SSC data were collected near the snout of the glacier (similar to 4000 m) at an interval of about 15 days for an entire ablation period (May-October 2001). Diurnal variability in SSC was found to be much higher than the discharge. Hysteresis trends between discharge and SSC were established. Results indicate that, for the study glacier, clockwise hysteresis dominated for the entire melt season, indicating that most of the time the SSC led the discharge. During the peak melt period, anticlockwise hysteresis was also observed for a few hours. Assessment of runoff-delaying characteristics was made by estimating the time lag between the occurrence of melting and its appearance as runoff along with estimation of time to peak. A comparison of runoff-delaying parameters with discharge ratio clearly indicated that changes in time lag and time to peak are inversely correlated with variations in discharge. Attempts have also been made to establish the relationship between discharge and SSC using short-interval data. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Dealing with institutional settings involving multiple stakeholders is essential for improving the applicability of reservoir operation optimization models. However, a centralized decision maker (CDM) is conventionally assumed to represent multiple players with perfect cooperation and information exchange for modeling the decision-making process with hierarchical structure and non-cooperative interactions in real problems. In this paper, we define the deviation of operation performance between the assumed centralized and the practical hierarchical decision-making procedures as an institutional gap (IG). To further derive the causes of the IG and evaluate the influence of the CDM's preference on the IG, a comparative analysis between bilevel programming and multi-objective programming (MOP) is conducted for the reservoir pre-impoundment problem (RPP). Compared to optimizing two conflicting objectives in MOP, our proposed bilevel optimization framework models the flood control rule maker and reservoir refill rule maker as minimizing the potential flood risk and maximizing the hydropower production benefit respectively with a hierarchical institutional structure. Our case study of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China indicates that the centralized optimization model without considering the hierarchical interaction between flood control and reservoir refill decision-makers would lead to an IG in terms of underestimation of flood risk. We further find that the magnitude of the IG is highly related to the selection of the CDM's preference, and the largest IG is obtained when the flood control or hydropower generation objective is solely considered. Particularly, we specify the range of preference setting which results in the domination of centralized model solutions as compared to the bilevel solution, although the solutions within this range are not realistic for practical operation. Our findings provide an insight into the cause of the IG as well as the effects of preference on the IG, facilitating future improvement of institutional structure design and preference setting for practical reservoir operation optimizations.

AB Increasing concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the northeastern U.S. have been attributed to two potential mechanisms: recovery from acidification and changing climate. Maine's high-elevation lakes (>600 m) could potentially provide unique insight into the response of surface water chemistry to declining acidic deposition and interannual climate variability. The geochemical response in 29 lakes was analyzed during 30 years of change in sulfate (SO42-) deposition and climate. All 29 lakes exhibited positive trends in DOC from 1986 to 2015, and 19 of 29 lakes had statistically significant increases in DOC throughout the study period. These results illustrate a region-wide change from low-DOC lakes (<5 mg/L) to moderate DOC lakes (5-30 mg/L). Increasing DOC trends for these high-elevation lakes were more consistent than for lower elevation lakes in the northeastern U.S. A linear mixed effects model demonstrated that lake water SO42- and climate variables describe most of the variability in DOC concentrations (r(2) = 50.78), and the strongest predictor of DOC concentration was an inverse relationship with SO42-. Due to SO42- concentrations trending toward preacidification levels and projections of a warmer, wetter, and more variable climate, there is uncertainty for the future trajectory of DOC trends in surface waters. Long-term monitoring of Maine's high-elevation lakes is critical to understand the recovery and response in surface water chemistry to a changing chemical and physical environment in the decades ahead.
   Plain Language Summary Increasing concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the northeastern U.S. have been attributed to two potential mechanisms: recovery from acidification and changing climate. Maine's high-elevation lakes provide unique insight into the response of surface water chemistry to declining acidic deposition and climate change. Surface water chemistry was monitored in 29 high-elevation lakes from 1986 to 2015 and analyzed in the context of declining acidic deposition and climate change. All 29 lakes exhibited positive trends in DOC, which illustrates a region-wide change from low-DOC lakes (<5 mg/L) to moderate DOC lakes (5-30 mg/L). The implications for this could be far reaching, for HELM lakes currently provide refugia for aquatic and macroinvertebrate communities that have declined in other places due to fish stocking, anthropogenic stressors, and a changing climate (Schilling et al., 2008, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01949.x). Due to sulfate concentrations trending toward preacidification levels and projections of a warmer, wetter, and more variable climate, there is uncertainty for the future trajectory of DOC trends in surface waters. Long-term monitoring of Maine's high-elevation lakes is critical to understand recovery and response in surface water chemistry to a changing chemical and physical environment in the decades ahead.

AB We propose an improvement of the overland-flow parameterization in a distributed hydrological model, which uses a constant horizontal grid resolution and employs the kinematic wave approximation for both hillslope and river channel flow. The standard parameterization lacks any channel flow characteristics for rivers, which results in reduced river flow velocities for streams narrower than the horizontal grid resolution. Moreover, the surface areas, through which these wider model rivers may exchange water with the subsurface, are larger than the real river channels potentially leading to unrealistic vertical flows. We propose an approximation of the subscale channel flow by scaling Manning's roughness in the kinematic wave formulation via a relationship between river width and grid cell size, following a simplified version of the Barre de Saint-Venant equations (Manning-Strickler equations). The too large exchange areas between model rivers and the subsurface are compensated by a grid resolution-dependent scaling of the infiltration/exfiltration rate across river beds. We test both scaling approaches in the integrated hydrological model ParFlow. An empirical relation is used for estimating the true river width from the mean annual discharge. Our simulations show that the scaling of the roughness coefficient and the hydraulic conductivity effectively corrects overland flow velocities calculated on the coarse grid leading to a better representation of flood waves in the river channels.

AB Frequent human activities and climate change in the karst region of southwest China since the 1950s have led to the investigation of response of runoff to climate and catchment properties. Runoff coefficient (Rc) as an expression variable of the catchment response to rainfall is important to describe runoff dynamics and to estimate available streamflow for utilization. In this study, the equations of Rc associated with its attributors of climate condition and catchment property were derived using the Budyko framework. The equations were used to estimate relationship between the Rc and the attributors in the karst catchments in Guizhou province of southwest China. Analysis in the selected 23 karst catchments demonstrates that the spatial distribution of Rc is dominated by the catchment properties, such as the catchment properties of geology, slope and land use and land cover, rather than climate condition of drought index. Correlation analysis indicates that the catchment with a large slope usually has a high value of Rc, and a large proportion of carbonate rock in a catchment reduces Rc in the study area. Temporal increasing trend of Rc during 1961-2000 was found for most catchments in the study area. This increasing trend was primarily resulted from changes of catchment properties, e. g. deforestation in large areas of Guizhou province during the 1950s-1980s.

AB Recharge processes of karst aquifers are difficult to assess given their strong heterogeneity and the poorly known effect of vadose zone on infiltration. However, recharge assessment is crucial for the evaluation of groundwater resources. Moreover, the vulnerability of karst aquifers depends on vadose zone behaviour because it is the place where most contamination takes place. In this work, an in situ experimental approach was performed to identify and quantify flow and storage processes occurring in karst vadose zone. Cave percolation monitoring and dye tracing were used to investigate unsaturated zone hydrological processes. Two flow components (diffuse and quick) were identified and, respectively, account for 66% and 34% of the recharge. Quickflow was found to be the result of bypass phenomenon in vadose zone related to water saturation. We identify the role of epikarst as a shunting area, most of the storage in the vadose zone occurring via the diffuse flow component in low permeability zones. Relationship between rainfall intensity and transit velocity was demonstrated, with 5 times higher velocities for the quick recharge mode than the diffuse mode. Modelling approach with KarstMod software allowed to simulate the hybrid recharge through vadose zone and shows promising chances to properly assess the recharge processes in karst aquifer based on simple physical models.

AB Hydrologists have a relatively good understanding of how rainfall variability shapes the catchment hydrograph, a reflection of the celerity of hydraulic head propagation. Much less is known about the influence of rainfall variability on catchment transit times, a reflection of water velocities that control solute transport. This work uses catchment-scale lumped parameter models to decompose the relationship between rainfall variability and an important metric of transit times, the time-varying fraction of young water (<90 days old) in streams (FYW). A coupled rainfall-runoff model and rank StorAge Selection (rSAS) transit time model were calibrated to extensive hydrometric and environmental tracer data from neighboring headwater catchments in Plynlimon, Wales from 1999 to 2008. At both sites, the mean annual FYW increased more than 13 percentage points from the driest to the wettest year. Yearly mean rainfall explained most between-year variation, but certain signatures of rainfall pattern were also associated with higher FYW including: more clustered storms, more negatively skewed storms, and higher covariance between daily rainfall and discharge. We show that these signatures are symptomatic of an "inverse storage effect'' that may be common among watersheds. Looking to the future, changes in rainfall due to projected climate change caused an up to 19 percentage point increase in simulated mean winter FYW and similarly large decreases in the mean summer FYW. Thus, climate change could seasonally alter the ages of water in streams at these sites, with concomitant impacts on water quality.
   Plain Language Summary Scientists use information about the age of water in streams to help diagnose the source of water and what pollution it may carry. Most stream water originates from rain, and its "age'' is the time that has passed since it fell from the sky. "Old'' water tends to seep into the stream from deep underground where it has been stored and filtered for years or even decades. "Young'' water, on the other hand, comes from recent storms and tends to carry pollution from the land surface directly into streams. This study used stream data and computer simulations to understand how the amount of young water in streams changes in response to wet and dry periods at two small streams in Plynlimon, Wales. We show that the proportion of young water is much higher during wet periods and can be surprisingly sensitive to the rainfall pattern. We also show that changes in rainfall due to climate change could significantly increase the proportion of young stream water in winter and decrease it in summer. We conclude that changes in rainfall under present and future climate conditions can significantly alter the age of water in streams and, in turn, the pollution it carries.

TI Modeling Rainfall-Runoff and Soil Erosion Processes on Hillslopes With

AB The effect of rill network planforms on hillslope rainfall-runoff and soil erosion processes is usually neglected in modeling practices, although they can markedly alter the hydrologic and geomorphic processes. Based on the CeRIRM model and WEPP erosion theory, a simple approach is developed to account for these effects. In the framework, several characteristic parameters including the average rill width, rill orientation angle, the number of rills, and number of discontinuous rills and their variations along the hillslope are introduced to represent the planar characteristics of the rill network. The model is tested against experimental erosion data from a hillslope subjected to three successive rainfall events, resulting in continuous rill network evolution. The results show that rill network planforms alter the partitioning of interrill and rill flows, thereby modifying the hydraulics, erosion, and sedimentation in the rills. Rill characteristics are found to significantly affect the amount of rill erosion. The new approach is compared to WEPP, which ignores rill network features. The WEPP approach of simulating rill erosion on hillslopes using one set of model parameters leads to errors that are up to 30% larger than the new approach that is able to account for spatially and temporally varying rill characteristics. The differences in cumulative rill erosion amounts between the two models vary significantly with slope length, slope angle, rill orientation angle, number of rills, and discontinuous rills. The results are valuable for the development of general rainfall-runoff and soil erosion models on hillslopes with complex geomorphic features.
   Plain Language Summary Rill erosion is one of the main forms of soil erosion and is associated with fast flowing water in networks of small channels, that is, rills. Modeling rill erosion is an important yet challenging task informing soil conservation. Although actual rill networks are usually composed of irregular, tortuous, and even discontinuous rills, using parallel and straight rills to simplify the actual rill network is still the prevailing method in current models. This study demonstrates the impact of the irregular planform of rill network on soil erosion and proposes a simple and effective conceptualization to represent complex rill networks using only a few parameters, including rill orientation angle, number of rills, and number of discontinuous rills. The approach can better represent the spatially intricate partitioning of interrill and rill flow and improve the modeling of rill hydraulics, erosion, and sedimentation prediction. Owing to its improved physical basis, the proposed approach simulates both the total amount and the spatial distribution of erosion with improved accuracy. The results of this study are expected to help improve general rainfall-runoff and soil erosion models for hillslopes with complex geomorphic features, and benefit other scientific fields involving transport through complex rill networks.

AB Pan evaporation, as a surrogate of potential evaporation, is reported to have decreased in different regions of the world since the 1950s. There is much literature to explain the decrease in pan evaporation using the so-called evaporation complimentary relationship hypothesis and it is argued that pan evaporation can be understood as a sign of global warming and indication of an accelerating hydrologic cycle. On the other hand, some scientists insist that the pan evaporation trends may be caused by a global dimming, which effectively reduces the solar radiation to the ground surface. However, few reports are available about the changes in pan evaporation and their implications to water balance in arid regions. In the present study, we investigate the trends in pan evaporation in arid regions of China over the past 50 years and attempt to characterize the changes in water balance in these areas. It is found that pan evaporation in these areas has portrayed a statistically significant decreasing trend, which may be attributed mainly to decreases in wind speed and diurnal temperature range and increase in precipitation. The trends in some major meteorological factors such as pan evaporation, precipitation, temperature, wind speed and others imply an enhanced hydrological cycle in the study area.

AB Global flood models integrate flood maps of constant probability in space, ignoring the correlation between sites and thus potentially misestimating the risk posed by extreme events. Stochastic flood models alleviate this issue through the simulation of flood events with a realistic spatial structure, yet their proliferation at large scales has historically been inhibited by data quality and computer availability. In this paper, we show, for the first time, the efficacy of modeled river discharge reanalyses in the characterization of flood spatial dependence in the absence of a dense stream gauge network. While global hydrological models may show poor correspondence with absolute observed river flows, we find that the rate at which they can simulate the joint occurrence of relative flow exceedances at two given locations is broadly similar to when a gauge-based statistical model is used. Evidenced over the United States, flood events simulated using observed gauge data from the U.S. Geological Survey versus those generated using modeled streamflows have similar (i) distributions of site-to-site correlation strength, (ii) relationships between event size and return period, and, importantly, (iii) loss distributions when incorporated into a continental-scale flood risk model. Extremal dependence is generally quantified less accurately on larger rivers, in arid climates, in mountainous terrain, and for the rarest high-magnitude events. However, local-scale errors are shown to broadly cancel each other out when combined, producing an unbiased flood spatial dependence model. These findings suggest that building accurate stochastic flood models worldwide may no longer be a distant aspiration.
   Plain Language Summary Global flood risk is commonly estimated through flood inundation maps with a defined probability of occurrence. These flood simulations have a key drawback in that they fail to capture the spatial patterns exhibited during real flood events, instead modeling the same probability of flooding on every river at once. Solutions which rely on networks of gauged river flow observations will necessarily break down in the majority of the world's regions which lack such a resource. In this paper, we use historic river flows simulated by global rainfall-runoff models (rather than observed flows) into a statistical model which captures the spatial correlation of flow extremes. If we examine the relative flow exceedance probabilities from these hydrological models rather than the volumetric flow values, flood events are generated which exhibit similar characteristics to those when gauged flow observations are used. Crucially, the simulation- and observation-generated flood events produce near-identical losses to buildings in the United States. The implications of this are that true stochastic flood risk models, which account for spatial dependence, can proliferate globally via the generation of realistic flood event sets from hydrological models.

AB This article presents a numerical study to investigate the combined role of partial well penetration (PWP) and non-Darcy effects concerning the performance of groundwater production wells. A finite difference model is developed in MATLAB to solve the two-dimensional mixed-type boundary value problem associated with flow to a partially penetrating well within a cylindrical confined aquifer. Non-Darcy effects are incorporated using the Forchheimer equation. The model is verified by comparison to results from existing semi-analytical solutions concerning the same problem but assuming Darcy's law. A sensitivity analysis is presented to explore the problem of concern. For constant pressure production, Non-Darcy effects lead to a reduction in production rate, as compared to an equivalent problem solved using Darcy's law. For fully penetrating wells, this reduction in production rate becomes less significant with time. However, for partially penetrating wells, the reduction in production rate persists for much larger times. For constant production rate scenarios, the combined effect of PWP and non-Darcy flow takes the form of a constant additional drawdown term. An approximate solution for this loss term is obtained by performing linear regression on the modeling results. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID PREDICTION; ALGORITHM
AB The emergence of artificial neural network (ANN) technology has provided many promising results in the field of hydrology and water resources simulation. However, one of the major criticisms of ANN hydrologic models is that they do not consider/explain the underlying physical processes in a watershed, resulting in them being labelled as black-box models. This paper discusses a research study conducted in order to examine whether or not the physical processes in a watershed are inherent in a trained ANN rainfall-runoff model. The investigation is based on analysing definite statistical measures of strength of relationship between the disintegrated hidden neuron responses of an ANN model and its input variables, as well as various deterministic components of a conceptual rainfall-runoff model. The approach is illustrated by presenting a case study for the Kentucky River watershed. The results suggest that the distributed structure of the ANN is able to capture certain physical behaviour of the rainfall-runoff process. The results demonstrate that the hidden neurons in the ANN rainfall-runoff model approximate various components of the hydrologic system, such as infiltration, base How, and delayed and quick surface flow, etc., and represent the rising limb and different portions of the falling limb of a flow hydrograph.

AB Physically based soil erosion simulation models require input parameters of soil detachment and sediment transport owing to the action and interactions of both raindrops and overland flow. A simple interrill soil water transport model is applied to a laboratory catchment to investigate the application of raindrop detachment and transport in interrill areas explicitly. A controlled laboratory rainfall simulation study with slope length simulation by flow addition was used to assess the raindrop detachment and transport of detached soil by overland flow in interrill areas. Artificial rainfall of moderate to high intensity was used to simulate intense rain storms. However, experiments were restricted to conditions where rilling and channelling did not occur and where overland flow covered most of the surface. A simple equation with a rainfall intensity term for raindrop detachment, and a simple sediment transport equation with unit discharge and a slope term were found to be applicable to the situation where clear water is added at the upper end of a small plot to simulate increased slope length. The proposed generic relationships can be used to predict raindrop detachment and the sediment transport capacity of interrill flow and can therefore contribute to the development of physically-based erosion models.

AB The coordination of social economy, water, and ecology is an important foundation for sustainable development. However, the interaction among social economy, water, and ecology are complex. The data scales between socioeconomic factors (normally at the spatial scale of the administrative region and the temporal scale of a year or month) and river water quality and ecological factors (normally at the spatial scale of a sub-basin and the temporal scale of an instantaneous value) do not match. Therefore, many current regulation methods do not sufficiently consider the interaction mechanisms between socioeconomic, water, and ecological factors or cannot adequately deal with the scale of the data. In this study, we proposed a new framework to assess the coordinated development of social economy, water, and ecology (SWE) by integrating the distributed social economy-water ecological model (SEWE) and the harmonious regulation model. We built the SEWE model by coupling a rainfall runoff model, river water quality, and ecological models; we built the harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method. We applied the proposed method and framework to the Shaying River Basin, which exhibited typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams, high pollution, and significant human activities. Results indicated that the coordinated development level of the SWE in the Shaying River Basin was poor, with the average coordination degree varying from 0.39 to 0.60. The average growth rate of the coordination degree of socioeconomic indicators was greater than that of the river water quality and ecological indicators. The coordination degree of water ecological indicators was small with a decreasing trend. These results indicated the increasing impact of socioeconomic development on river water quality and ecology. Therefore, the Shaying River Basin should focus on ecological and environmental restoration, such as the effective control of pollution draining into rivers. The proposed methods and framework could contribute to the integrated water resource management of the basin.

ID QUALITY; MODELS
AB In irrigation areas, ground water salinity (GWS) levels may vary depending on the amount and quality of irrigation water applied and on the activity of the drainage system. GWS plays a vital role in irrigation systems by influencing whether the environment is suitable for plant growth. Hence, it is necessary to monitor changes in GWS both temporally and spatially. Maps are generally used to visualize this information. However, evaluation of temporal and spatial variations of GWS can be difficult because of the necessity of assessing many maps together to understand both temporal and spatial changes. In this study, a data assessment method that can be used for multi-year ground water salinity evaluations is presented. The method looks at the spatial and temporal relationships between the main salinity classes present in the study area, their typical locations (i.e. areas where the salinity classes are most frequently located), and the alternate salinity classes in those locations in any of the years of the time series. As a case study, the method was applied to multi-year (1990-2000) GWS observations in the Mustafakemalpasa irrigation project (19370 ha) in the Marmara region of north-western Turkey.

AB Distributions of water transit times (TTDs), and related storage-selection (SAS) distributions, are spatially integrated metrics of hydrological transport within landscapes. Recent works confirm that the form of TTDs and SAS distributions should be considered time variant-possibly depending, in predictable ways, on the dynamic storage of water within the landscape. We report on a 28 day periodic-steady-state-tracer experiment performed on a model hillslope contained within a 1 m(3) sloping lysimeter. Using experimental data, we calibrate physically based, spatially distributed flow and transport models, and use the calibrated models to generate time-variable SAS distributions, which are subsequently compared to those directly observed from the actual experiment. The objective is to use the spatially distributed estimates of storage and flux from the model to characterize how temporal variation in water storage influences temporal variation in flow path configurations, and resulting SAS distributions. The simulated SAS distributions mimicked well the shape of observed distributions, once the model domain reflected the spatial heterogeneity of the lysimeter soil. The spatially distributed flux vectors illustrate how the magnitude and directionality of water flux changes as the water table surface rises and falls, yielding greater contributions of younger water when the water table surface rises nearer to the soil surface. The illustrated mechanism is compliant with conclusions drawn from other recent studies and supports the notion of an inverse-storage effect, whereby the probability of younger water exiting the system increases with storage. This mechanism may be prevalent in hillslopes and headwater catchments where discharge dynamics are controlled by vertical fluctuations in the water table surface of an unconfined aquifer.
   Plain Language Summary Volumes of water reside within landscapes for varying amounts of time before they are discharged to a stream. That length of time determines how long the water has to interact chemically with soil and rock, and therefore influences the chemistry of water that ends up in stream channels. Quantifying the full range and variability of those travel times remains a challenge. We built an experimental hillslope, which allows us to keep track of all the water that enters and exits the soil-something that is difficult to accomplish in open environmental systems. We introduced chemically distinct water into the hillslope at specific points in time and followed the movement of that water within, and upon exit from the soil. We discovered that the water being discharged from the hillslope tends to have resided in the landscape for shorter lengths of time when the hillslope is very wet (like a wetted sponge) than when it is very dry (like a dry sponge). This insight helps us understand how different rainfall regimes, and the associated wetness of the landscape, can potentially influence water transit times through the landscape, and their relationship with stream chemistry.

AB Although numerous studies have acknowledged that vegetation can reduce erosion, few process-based studies have examined how vegetation cover affect runoff hydraulics and erosion processes. We present field observations of overland flow hydraulics using rainfall simulations in a typical semiarid area in China. Field plots (5 x 2 m(2)) were constructed on a loess hillslope (25 degrees), including bare soil plot as control and three plots with planted forage species as treatments-Astragalus adsurgens, Medicago sativa and Cosmos bipinnatus. Both simulated rainfall and simulated rainfall + inflow were applied. Forages reduced soil loss by 55-85% and decreased overland flow rate by 12-37%. Forages significantly increased flow hydraulic resistance expressed by Darcy-Weisbach friction factor by 188-202% and expressed by Manning's friction factor by 66-75%; and decreased overland flow velocity by 28-30%. The upslope inflow significantly increased overland flow velocity by 67% and stream power by 449%, resulting in increased sediment yield rate by 108%. Erosion rate exhibited a significant linear relationship with stream power. M. sativa exhibited the best in reducing soil loss which probably resulted from its role in reducing stream power. Forages on the downslope performed better at reducing sediment yield than upslope due to decreased rill formation and stream power. The findings contribute to an improved understanding of using vegetation to control water and soil loss and land degradation in semiarid environments.

AB The heterogeneity of hillslope material and variations in its hydrological characteristics affect the spatial and temporal fluctuation of soil moisture patterns within a landslide. Moisture conditions of the unsaturated zone influence the distribution, intensity and time delay of groundwater recharge from precipitation. High-resolution monitoring of hydrological features of the near-surface soil layer is necessary to advance understanding of the temporal behaviour of complex landslides and their displacement dynamics. This paper aims to show the potential of high temporal and spatial resolution temperature sensing for hydrological analysis of unstable slopes. The main focus of this research is to detect the spatial and temporal variation in soil moisture conditions through the monitoring of soil thermal properties. We present qualitative and quantitative analyses of soil temperature data collected during three field campaigns in the black marls mudslide of Super-Sauze (France). The temperature data are used to determine soil thermal parameters that are affected by bulk density and soil moisture content. On the basis of the spatial and temporal variation of the soil thermal parameters, the information about soil moisture content fluctuations could be obtained. Promising empirical relationships between apparent thermal diffusivity and soil moisture content have been obtained when accounting for local heterogeneities in soil characteristics. Furthermore, the requirements and limitation of the proposed methodology for clay shale material is elaborated. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Management of upland land-use has considerable potential for mitigating flood risk by increasing topsoil storage and slowing overland flow. Recent work has highlighted the potential for vegetation to impact the velocity of saturation-excess overland flow. Woodland creation is widely proposed for Natural Flood Management (NFM), but data on saturation-excess overland flow in woodland habitats is lacking. Here we measure soil properties and overland flow velocities in established broadleaf woodland and wood pasture with an understorey dominated by either grass or bracken. We show that wood pasture dominated by bracken has overland flow velocity 12-20% lower than established broadleaf woodland and 19-27% lower than grass-dominated wood pasture. Established woodland soils exhibited eight times higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than bracken-dominated wood pasture and 80 times higher than grass-dominated wood pasture. We conclude that upland habitats can be managed to reduce flood risk, first by storing storm water in the soil and then by reducing overland flow velocity through rough surface vegetation. These factors combine to reduce floods by delaying the onset of overland flow runoff and slowing its delivery to streams. It is clear than Manning's n is far from constant in these shallow overland flows, the development of overland flow datasets is, therefore, also beneficial for improving the theory and practice of hillslope rainfall-runoff modelling.

AB Probabilistic water balance modelling provides a useful framework for investigating the interactions between soil, vegetation, and the atmosphere. It has been used to estimate temporal soil moisture dynamics and ecohydrological responses at a point. This study combines a nonlinear rainfallrunoff theory with probabilistic water balance model to represent varied source area runoff as a function of rainfall depth and a runoff coefficient at hillslope scale. Analytical solutions of the soil-moisture probability density function and average water balance model are then developed. Based on a sensitivity analysis of soil moisture dynamics, we show that when varied source area runoff is incorporated, mean soil moisture is always lower and total runoff higher, compared with the original probabilistic water balance model. The increased runoff from the inclusion of varied source area runoff is mainly because of a reduction in leakage when the index of dryness is less than one and evapotranspiration when the index of dryness is greater than one. Inclusion of varied source area runoff in the model means that the actual evapotranspiration is limited by less available water (i.e. water limit), which is stricter than Budyko's and Milly's water limit. Application of the model to a catchment located in Western Australia showed that the method can predict annual value of actual evapotranspiration and streamflow accurately.

AB The purpose of this paper is to trace the evolution of key water-related laws and management practices in Kansas, from the enactment of the Kansas Water Resources Appropriation Act of 1945 to the present, in order to highlight the state's efforts to create a more sustainable water future and in hopes that others will benefit from Kansas' experience. The 1945 Act provides the basic framework of water law (prior appropriation) in Kansas. Progression of groundwater management in the state encompasses local Groundwater Management Districts (GMDs) and their water-management programs, minimum-streamflow and TMDL standards, water-use reporting and water metering programs, use of modified safe-yield policies in some GMDs, the subbasin water-resources-management program, the integrated resource planning/aquifer storage and recovery project of the city of Wichita, the Central Kansas Water Bank, enhanced aquifer subunits management, and various water conservation programs. While these have all contributed to the slowing down of declines in groundwater levels in the High Plains aquifer and in associated ecosystems, they have not yet succeeded in halting those declines. Based on the assumption that the different management approaches have to operate easily within the prevailing water rights and law framework to succeed, a number of steps are suggested here that may help further diminish or reverse the declines of the High Plains aquifer. These include eliminating the "use it or lose it" maxim in the prior-appropriation framework, broadening the definition of "beneficial use," regulating domestic and other "exempt" wells, encouraging voluntary "sharing the shortage" agreements, and determining to what extent water rights may be regulated in the public interest without a compensable "taking". Further measures include establishing artificial recharge and/or aquifer storage and recovery projects wherever feasible and determining to what extent water-rights holders might be subjected to reasonable dictates without having the security of their rights altered.

AB Calibration of a groundwater model requires that hydraulic properties be estimated throughout a model domain. This generally constitutes an underdetermined inverse problem, for which a Solution can only be found when some kind of regularization device is included in the inversion process. Inclusion of regularization in the calibration process can be implicit, for example through the use of zones of constant parameter value, or explicit, for example through solution of a constrained minimization problem in which parameters are made to respect preferred values, or preferred relationships, to the degree necessary for a unique solution to be obtained.
   The "cost of uniqueness" is this: no matter which regularization methodology is employed, the inevitable consequence of its use is a loss of detail in the calibrated field. This, ill turn, can lead to erroneous predictions made by a model that is ostensibly "well calibrated". Information made available as a by-product of the regularized inversion process allows the reasons for this loss of detail to be better understood. In particular, it is easily demonstrated that the estimated value for an hydraulic property at any point within a model domain is, in fact, a weighted average of the true hydraulic property over a much larger area. This averaging process causes loss of resolution in the estimated field. Where hydraulic conductivity is the hydraulic property being estimated, high averaging weights exist in areas that are strategically disposed with respect to measurement wells, while other areas may contribute very little to the estimated hydraulic conductivity at any point within the model domain, this possibly making the detection of hydraulic conductivity anomalies in these latter areas almost impossible. A study of the post-calibration parameter field covariance matrix allows further insights into the loss of system detail incurred through the calibration process to be gained. A comparison of pre- and post-calibration parameter covariance matrices shows that the latter often possess a much smaller spectral bandwidth than the former. It is also demonstrated that, as all inevitable consequence of the fact that a calibrated model cannot replicate every detail of the true system, model-to-measurement residuals can show a high degree of spatial correlation, a fact which must be taken into account when assessing these residuals either qualitatively, or quantitatively in the exploration of model predictive uncertainty.
   These principles are demonstrated using a synthetic case in which spatial parameter definition is based oil pilot points, and calibration is Implemented using both zones of piecewise constancy and constrained minimization regularization. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, ten best management practices (BMP) were implemented on agricultural areas in the Saginaw River Watershed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model based on four targeting methods (Load per Subbasin Area Index (LPSAI), Load per Unit Area Index (LPUAI), Concentration Impact Index (CII), and Load Impact Index (LII)). The effective BMPs both for targeting and non-targeting pollutants were contour farming (CF) (except total nitrogen reduction during total phosphorus targeting scenario), residue management 1000kg/ha and 2000kg/ha, strip cropping, recharge structures, terracing, and native grass (NG). In contrast, conservation tillage and no tillage did not reduce significant amount of pollutants for any combination of targeting methods and priority areas. In regard to spatial correlation between targeting methods, a strong relationship was found between the LPSAI and LPUAI methods both for the sediment and total nitrogen targeting scenarios. In addition, a similar result was found between the CII and LPSAI targeting methods. Regarding the spatiotemporal variability of BMP implementation plan, distinct change in priority area was observed in the case of NG implementation by the end of the secondyear; however, this impact was minimal for CF due to less pollutant reduction efficiency compared to NG.

AB The construction of a river barrage can increase groundwater levels upstream of the barrage during the rainy season. Analytical and statistical approaches were applied to evaluate the relationship between groundwater and river water at the Changnyeong-Haman river barrage in Korea using time series data of water level and electrical conductivity from June 2011 to September 2014. An artificial neural network based time series model was designed to filter out the effect of rainfall from the groundwater level data in the study area. Aquifer diffusivity and river resistance were estimated from the analytical solution of a one-dimensional unit step response function by using the filtered groundwater level data. River resistance increased in response to groundwater level fluctuations. Cross-correlation analyses between the groundwater and the river water showed that the lag time increased during the observation period for both the water level and the electrical conductivity while the cross-correlation function declined for the same period. The results indicated that a constant river stage maintained at the river barrage can weaken the hydrologic stress and reduce the exchange of material between the river and the adjacent aquifer because of the deposition of fine sediment on the river bottom and walls.

AB Understanding the effects of hydrological processes on solute dynamics is critical to interpret biogeochemical processes. Water chemistry and isotopic compositions of surface water (delta O-18(w) and delta D-w) were investigated in rivers from Southwest China to study the effects of hydrological variability on biogeochemical processes. The inverse relationship between deuterium excess (d-excess) and delta O-18(w) could be ascribed to non-equilibrium fractionation processes, and the slope of the Local River Water Line was much lower than the Local Meteoric Water Line, suggesting the post-precipitation evaporation pattern. The evaporation fraction (1-f) was estimated by the d-excess method, varying from 0.01 to 0.18. (1-f), was a function of water temperature and drainage mean elevation, indicating that evaporation easily occurs at high temperatures in low-elevation regions. The hydrological processes co-varied with solute dynamics in the river network, and fluid transit time and temperature were likely responsible for the co-variations. Also, we found that hydrological processes played an important role in solute dynamics through shifting the geochemical processes (e.g., enrichment, water-rock reaction, photosynthesis, and secondary mineral precipitation). This study highlights that biogeochemical processes co-vary with hydrological processes, and we suggest that investigating hydrological processes can help to understand biogeochemical processes.

TI BAYESIAN STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION OF RESERVOIR OPERATION USING UNCERTAIN

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID MANAGEMENT; MODELS
AB Operation of reservoir systems using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) and Bayesian decision theory (BDT) is investigated in this study. The proposed model, called Bayesian stochastic dynamic programming (BSDP), which includes inflow, storage, and forecast as state variables, describes streamflows with a discrete lag 1 Markov process, and uses BDT to incorporate new information by updating the prior probabilities to posterior probabilities, is used to generate optimal reservoir operating rules. This continuous updating can significantly reduce the effects of natural and forecast uncertainties in the model. In order to test the value of the BSDP model for generating optimal operating rules, real-time reservoir operation simulation models are constructed using 95 years of monthly historical inflows of the Gunpowder River to Loch Raven reservoir in Maryland. The rules generated by the BSDP model are applied in an operation simulation model and their performance is compared with an alternative stochastic dynamic programming (ASDP) model and a classical stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model. BSDP differs from the other two models in the selection of state variables and the way the transition probabilities are formed and updated.

AB Spatially distributed hydrological models require information on the land cover pattern, as it directly influences the generation of run-off. However, it is not clear which detail of land cover information is suitable for simulating the catchment hydrology. A better understanding of the relationship between the land cover detail and the hydrological processes is therefore required as it would enhance a successful application of the hydrological model. This study investigates the relevance of accurate information about the crop types in the catchment for the simulation of run-off, baseflow and evapotranspiration. Results reveal that adding knowledge about the crop type in the model simulation is redundant when area-averaged water flux predictions are intended. On the contrary, when a spatial distribution of water flux predictions is desired, it is meaningful to increase the land cover detail because an increased heterogeneity in the land cover map induces an increased heterogeneity in the hydrological response and locally reduces the uncertainty in the model prediction up to 50%. To assess the land cover uncertainty and to locate the regions for which the reduction in prediction uncertainty is the highest, the thematic uncertainty map (constructed through fuzzy logic) is shown to be a useful tool.

AB Several large-scale revegetation programs in China have resulted in significant changes in forest cover (Delta F) during the past three decades. As forests have important effects on catchment hydrology, evaluating the effects of Delta F on hydrology is essential. Using data from 44 catchments across China, this study derived a rational analytical equation to link changes in actual evapotranspiration (Delta ET) with those in F within the Budyko framework, and further quantified the effects of Delta F on ET variation during 1976-2015. The elasticity of ET to Delta F was found to be the greatest in the dry catchments in northwest China, followed by the humid catchments in south China, and was the smallest in the subhumid and semiarid catchments in north China. F averaged across all the catchments has increased, and has further led to the increase in ET. The F-ET relationship has become more prominent in the recent decade (2006-2015), with 68.0% of the catchments showing an average increase in F of 4.5% and a resultant average increase in ET of 8.2% compared with the baseline period (1976-1985). These results are helpful for quantitative assessment of hydrological responses to afforestation, especially in water-limited regions.

AB Explanations for distinct adjacent ecosystems that extend across hilly landscapes typically point to differences in climate or land use. Here we document-within a similar climate-how contrasting regional plant communities correlate with distinct underlying lithology and reveal how differences in water storage capacity in the critical zone (CZ) explain this relationship. We present observations of subsurface CZ structure and groundwater dynamics from deep boreholes and quantify catchment-wide dynamic water storage in two Franciscan rock types of the Northern California Coast Ranges. Our field sites have a Mediterranean climate, where rains are out of phase with solar energy, amplifying the importance of subsurface water storage for periods of peak ecosystem productivity in the dry season. In the deeply weathered (similar to 30 m at ridge) Coastal Belt argillite and sandstone, ample, seasonally replenished rock moisture supports an evergreen forest and groundwater drainage sustains baseflow throughout the summer. In the Central Belt argillite-matrix melange, a thin CZ (similar to 3 m at ridge) limits total dynamic water storage capacity (100-200 mm) and rapidly sheds winter rainfall via shallow storm and saturation overland flow, resulting in low plant-available water (inferred from predawn tree water potential) and negligible groundwater storage that can drain to streams in summer. This storage limitation mechanism explains the presence of an oak savanna-woodland bounded by seasonally ephemeral streams, despite >1,800 mm of average precipitation. Through hydrologic monitoring and subsurface characterization, we reveal a mechanism by which differences in rock type result in distinct regionally extensive plant communities under a similar climate.
   Plain Language Summary The ability of the subsurface critical zone-extending from the ground surface down to fresh, unweathered bedrock-to store and release water to plants and streams is a key variable explaining ecosystem composition and function. The storage and release of water are particularly important in Mediterranean climates, where rain arrives in winter and summers are typically warm and dry. Here plants rely half the year on seasonally replenished water from belowground. We documented how the subsurface structure of the critical zone determines how water is shed from landscapes and how much water can be seasonally stored. We found that locations with a thicker critical zone had higher water storage capacity, more productive ecosystems, deeper groundwater runoff generation, and greater summer streamflow. Where the critical zone is thin and storage capacity is limited, the subsurface completely saturates, and the landscape sheds incoming rain via surface runoff. This water storage limitation explains the presence of an oak savanna-woodland in the Northern California Coast Ranges, where rainfall is ample, and neighboring areas experiencing similar climate have towering forest canopies. Rock type governed these variations, highlighting its importance in determining the distribution of ecosystems and water runoff pathways to streams.

AB As the relationship between vegetation and soil moisture is complex and reciprocal, there is a need to understand how spatial patterns in soil moisture influence the distribution of vegetation, and how the structure of vegetation canopies and root networks regulates the partitioning of precipitation. Spatial patterns of soil moisture are often difficult to visualise as usually, soil moisture is measured at point scales, and often difficult to extrapolate. Here, we address the difficulties in collecting large amounts of spatial soil moisture data through a study combining plot- and transect-scale electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys to estimate soil moisture in a 3.2 km(2) upland catchment in the Scottish Highlands. The aim was to assess the spatio-temporal variability in soil moisture under Scots pine forest (Pinus sylvestris) and heather moorland shrubs (Calluna vulgaris); the two dominant vegetation types in the Scottish Highlands. The study focussed on one year of fortnightly ERT surveys. The surveyed resistivity data was inverted and Archie's law was used to calculate volumetric soil moisture by estimating parameters and comparing against field measured data. Results showed that spatial soil moisture patterns were more heterogeneous in the forest site, as were patterns of wetting and drying, which can be linked to vegetation distribution and canopy structure. The heather site showed a less heterogeneous response to wetting and drying, reflecting the more uniform vegetation cover of the shrubs. Comparing soil moisture temporal variability during growing and non-growing seasons revealed further contrasts: under the heather there was little change in soil moisture during the growing season. Greatest changes in the forest were in areas where the trees were concentrated reflecting water uptake and canopy partitioning. Such differences have implications for climate and land use changes; increased forest cover can lead to greater spatial variability, greater growing season temporal variability, and reduced levels of soil moisture, whilst projected decreasing summer precipitation may alter the feedbacks between soil moisture and vegetation water use and increase growing season soil moisture deficits.

AB Soil moisture data are critical to understanding biophysical and societal impacts of climate change. However, soil moisture data availability is limited due to sparse in situ monitoring, particularly in mountain regions. Here we present methods, specifications, and initial results from the interactive Roaring Fork Observation Network (iRON), a soil, weather, and ecological monitoring system in the Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Initiated in 2012, the network is currently composed of nine stations, distributed in elevation from 1,890 to 3,680m, that continually collect and transmit measurements of soil moisture at three depths (5, 20, and 50cm), soil temperature (20cm), and meteorological conditions. Time-lapse cameras for phenological observations, snow depth sensors, and periodic co-located vegetation surveys complement selected stations. iRON was conceived and designed with the joint purpose of supporting bioclimatic research and resource management objectives in a snow-dominated watershed. In the short term, iRON data can be applied to assessing the impact of temperature and precipitation on seasonal soil moisture conditions and trends. As more data are collected over time, iRON will help improve understanding of climate-driven changes to soil, vegetation, and hydrologic conditions. In presenting this network and its initial data, we hope that the network's elevational gradient will contribute to bioclimatic mountain research, while active collaboration with partners in resource management may provide a model for science-practice interaction in support of long-term monitoring.
   Plain Language Summary As climate change drives shifts in temperature and precipitation, researchers and resource managers can benefit from improved monitoring of soil moisture. Understanding the relationship between soil moisture and other system components is crucial to improving water availability projections and understanding ecosystem responses to climate change. Despite their significance, in-ground soil-moisture measurements are often not available across multiple elevations within a single watershed. This paper presents a network in the Southern Rocky Mountains intended to help address this data gap and compliment data from other networks. The interactive Roaring Fork Observation Network consists of nine locations across an 1,800-m change in elevation. Each station measures soil moisture at three depths, soil temperature, air temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Some stations are equipped with cameras or snow depth gauges, and for eight sites vegetation surveys are conducted. The data are available through a simple data portal. The network was established with local resource manager support, and one of its guiding purposes is to support management and restoration planning efforts. Because of the network's ongoing monitoring across multiple elevations and habitats, interactive Roaring Fork Observation Network will provide researchers and resource managers with access to valuable information about changes in soil conditions in a changing climate.

AB Lengthy records of river discharge are necessary to comprehensively assess the long-term connection between synoptic climate forcings and nival-regime systems in British Columbia. A regional multispecies network of tree-ring width and ring density chronologies was built for west central British Columbia with the intention of dendrohydrologically extending short runoff records in this area. Extended records of July-August mean discharge anomalies for the Skeena and Atnarko Rivers were reconstructed back to AD 1660. Low flow events represented during the late 1600s, early 1700s and late 1800s lie beyond those experienced during the recent instrumental period for these basins. The documentation of extreme events of this magnitude necessitates consideration when planning for future water resources in this region.
   Supplementary dendroclimatic reconstructions of the winter Pacific North American (PNA) pressure anomaly pattern and records of mean summer temperature and end-of-winter snow water equivalent were also constructed. These ancillary climate records provide insight into the long-term climate drivers of annual discharge dynamics within these nival basins. Correlation and wavelet analyses confirm the persistent relationship of synoptic climate regimes described by the Southern Oscillation Index, NINO 3.4, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and PNA indices on runoff in west central British Columbia.

AB The structure, functioning and hydrodynamic properties of aquifers can be determined from an analysis of the spatial variability of baseflow in the streams with which they are associated. Such analyses are based on simple low-cost measurements. Through interpreting the hydrological profiles (Q = f (A)) it is possible to locate the aquifer(s) linked to the stream network and to determine the type of interrelated flow, i.e. whether the stream drains or feeds the aquifer. Using an analytical solution developed for situations with a positive linear relationship, i.e. where the baseflow increases linearly with increasing catchment size, it is also possible to estimate the permeability of the aquifer(s) concerned at catchment scale.
   Applied to the hard-rock aquifers of the Oman ophiolite, this method shows that the 'gabbro' aquifer is more permeable than the 'peridotite' aquifer. As a consequence the streams drain the peridotites and 'leak' into the gabbro. The hydrological profiles within the peridotite are linear and positive, and indicate homogeneity in the hydrodynamic properties of these formations at the kilometre scale. The permeability of the peridotite is estimated at 5.10(-7) to 5.10(-8) m/s. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

TI POWER LAW DISTRIBUTIONS OF DISCHARGE MASS AND ENERGY IN RIVER BASINS

ID SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY; TURBULENCE; NETWORKS; MODEL
AB River networks constitute dissipative systems with many spatial degrees of freedom. Previous work by Mandelbrot (1983) and Bak et al. (1987, 1988, 1990) suggests that such systems will follow power law distributions in their mass and energy characteristics. It is shown that this is the case for river networks where the exponent beta in the distribution, P[X > x] proportional-to x-beta, is approximately equal to 0.45 and 0.90 for discharge and energy respectively in the case of several networks analyzed in North America when these variables are calculated for each individual link throughout the drainage network. An explanation of the values of beta is offered based on the fractal structure of rivers and on principles of energy expenditure in river basins.

AB The relationship between seasonal catchment water storage and discharge is typically nonunique due to water storage that is not directly hydraulically connected to streams. Hydraulically disconnected water volumes are often ecologically and hydrologically important but cannot be explicitly estimated using current storage-discharge techniques. Here, we propose that discharge is explicitly sensitive to changes in only some fraction of seasonally dynamic storage that we call "direct storage," whereas the remaining storage ("indirect storage") varies without directly influencing discharge. We use a coupled mass balance and storage-discharge function approach to partition seasonally dynamic storage between these 2 pools in the Northern California Coast Ranges. We find that indirect storage constitutes the vast majority of dynamic catchment storage, even at the wettest times of the year. Indirect storage exhibits lower variability over the course of the wet season (and in successive winter periods) than does direct storage. Predicted indirect storage volumes and dynamics match field observations. Comparison of 2 neighbouring field sites reveals that indirect storage volumes can occur as unsaturated storage held under tension in soils and weathered bedrock and as near-surface saturated storage that remains on hillslopes (and is eventually evapotranspired). Indirect storage volumes (including moisture in the weathered bedrock) may support plant transpiration, and our method indicates that this important water source could be quantified from precipitation and stream discharge records.

AB The storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in deep saline aquifers has been suggested as a promising method for stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of CO2. An accurate evaluation of the CO2 trapping mechanisms, such as convective mixing, is crucial for estimates of storage capacity and security. We recently investigated the gravitational stability of the diffusive boundary layer underneath a capillary transition zone by performing a linear stability analysis, which provides a quantitative description of the onset of convection for the two-phase, buoyancy-driven flow in the presence of the capillary transition zone (Emami-Meybodi and Hassanzadeh, 2013). In this paper, we further examine the effect of the capillary transition zone on the onset of convection and subsequent convective mixing using direct numerical simulations. We describe key features of the two-phase convective mixing for systems with low Rayleigh numbers (Ra <= 1000) and the measurement of several global quantities, such as the total CO2 dissolution, Sherwood number, swelling factor, and interface velocity. We show that the commonly used assumption of a sharp CO2-brine interface with constant CO2 concentration at the top of an aquifer (i.e. single-phase system) may lead to erroneous estimates of not only the onset of convection, but also of the rate and magnitude of CO2 dissolution. The significant effect of the capillary transition zone on the dissolution of CO2 under a buoyant plume in saline aquifers is explained; and, the link between the capillary transition zone and the volume change, due to CO2 dissolution and the interface velocity over the mixing process, is demonstrated. Compared to the single-phase system, a crossflow through the interface of the diffusive boundary layer with the capillary transition zone, as well as the upward advance of the interface motion, may enhance the convective mixing early in the period of natural convection. The decrease in the onset time and stronger mass flux may be more profound in the two-phase system than in the previously reported single-phase models. Furthermore, we report several scaling relationships that characterize the mixing process in the presence of the capillary transition zone. Our findings provide further insight into the understanding of the two-phase mixing features and the long-term fate of the injected CO2 in deep saline aquifers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Watershed structure influences the timing, magnitude, and spatial location of water and solute entry to stream networks. In turn, stream reach transport velocities and stream network geometry (travel distances) further influence the timing of export from watersheds. Here, we examine how watershed and stream network organization can affect travel times of water from delivery to the stream network to arrival at the watershed outlet. We analysed watershed structure and network geometry and quantified the relationship between stream discharge and solute velocity across six study watersheds (11.4 to 62.8km(2)) located in the Sawtooth Mountains of central Idaho, USA. Based on these analyses, we developed stream network travel time functions for each watershed. We found that watershed structure, stream network geometry, and the variable magnitude of inputs across the network can have a pronounced affect on water travel distances and velocities within a stream network. Accordingly, a sample taken at the watershed outlet is composed of water and solutes sourced from across the watershed that experienced a range of travel times in the stream network. We suggest that understanding and quantifying stream network travel time distributions are valuable for deconvolving signals observed at watershed outlets into their spatial and temporal sources, and separating terrestrial and in-channel hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological influences on in-stream observations.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK; ALGORITHM
AB This paper analyses the skills of fuzzy computing based rainfall-runoff model in real time flood forecasting. The potential of fuzzy computing has been demonstrated by developing a model for forecasting the river flow of Narmada basin in India. This work has demonstrated that fuzzy models can take advantage of their capability to simulate the unknown relationships between a set of relevant hydrological data such as rainfall and river flow. Many combinations of input variables were presented to the model with varying structures as a sensitivity study to verify the conclusions about the coherence between precipitation, upstream runoff and total watershed runoff. The most appropriate set of input variables was determined, and the study suggests that the river flow of Narmada behaves more like an autoregressive process. As the precipitation is weighted only a little by the model, the last time-steps of measured runoff are dominating the forecast. Thus a forecast based on expected rainfall becomes very inaccurate. Although good results for one-step-ahead forecasts arc received, the accuracy deteriorates as the lead time increases. Using the one-step-ahead forecast model recursively to predict flows at higher lead time, however, produces better results as opposed to different independent fuzzy models to forecast flows at various lead times.

AB Pond-cypress (Taxodium ascendens Brong.) is a dominant canopy species in depressional wetlands of the south-eastern Coastal Plain. Unsustainable withdrawals from the karst Floridan aquifer system have caused premature decline and death of pond-cypress trees, presumably owing to altered hydroperiods (which alter the flow of water and nutrients in trees). There has been no scientifically based means to determine sustainable yield from this regional aquifer system or to detect early stages of physical/ecological damage associated with groundwater mining and aquifer storage and recovery (ASR, which also can alter natural hydroperiods). In this study, the relationship between visual symptoms (indicators) of stress or premature decline, and spectral reflectance was evaluated using dried, milled branch tips collected from natural stands of mature pond-cypress. Depressional systems evaluated represented four of the six aquifer system subregions where subsurface perturbations from groundwater mining: (i) were presumed not to be occurring (reference wetlands); (ii) may be occurring but are not documented; and (iii) have been confirmed. Sampled trees were assigned to one of three stress classes (1, no/minimal; 2, moderate; 3, severe) based on the visual indicators. Partial least squares-linear discriminant analysis of second derivative spectral transformations in the visible/shortwave near-infrared (NIR) region (400-1100 nm) and the NIR region (1100-2500 nm) was used to evaluate the samples in assigned classes.

TI MULTISCALING THEORY OF FLOOD PEAKS - REGIONAL QUANTILE ANALYSIS

AB We study the spatial random field of peak flows indexed by a channel network. Invariance of the probability distributions of peak flows under translation on this indexing set defines statistical homogeneity in a network. It implies that hoods can be indexed by the network magnitude, or equivalently the drainage area, which serves as a scale parameter. This definition generalizes to homogeneity of flows in a geographical region containing several networks which are not necessarily the subnetworks of a single network. The widely used quantile regression method of the United States Geological Survey(USGS) provides one simple criterion to approximately designate homogeneous geographic regions. It is argued that the redefinition of homogeneity via the constancy of the coefficient of variation (CV) of floods implied by the index flood assumption is ad hoc. Invariance of the probability distributions of peak flows under scale change is used to develop the simple scaling and the multiscaling theories of regional hoods in terms of their quantiles. The simple scaling theory predicts a constant CV and log-log linearity between flood quantiles and drainage areas such that the slopes in these equations do not change with the probability of exceedance. Multiscaling theory of floods is developed to exhibit differences in floods between small and large basins. This theory shows that the CV for small basins increases, and for large basins it decreases, as area increases; Moreover, the quantiles do not obey log-log linearity with-respect to drainage areas. However, for large basins an approximate log-log linearity between quantiles and drainage areas is shown to hold. The slopes in these equations decrease as p decreases; i.e., larger floods have smaller slopes than smaller floods. This approximation provides a theoretical interpretation of the results of the empirical quantile regression method in homogeneous regions where simple scaling or the index flood assumption does not hold. Recent results on physical interpretations of the scaling theories are also summarized here. A simple nonlinear method is developed to estimate the parameters in the multiscaling theory. This method and other features of the theory are illustrated using flood data from central Appalachia in the United States.

AB The processes of hillslope runoff and erosion are typically represented at coarse spatial resolution in catchment-scale models due to computational limitations. Such representation typically fails to incorporate the important effects of topographic heterogeneity on runoff generation, overland flow, and soil erosion. These limitations currently undermine the application of distributed catchment models to understand the importance of thresholds and connectivity on hillslope and catchment-scale runoff and erosion, particularly in semi-arid environments. This paper presents a method for incorporating high-resolution topographic data to improve sub-grid scale parameterization of hillslope overland flow and erosion models. Results derived from simulations conducted using a kinematic wave overland flow model at 0.5m spatial resolution are used to parameterize the depth-discharge relationship in the overland flow model when applied at 16m resolution. The high-resolution simulations are also used to derive a more realistic parameterization of excess flow shear stress for use in the 16m resolution erosion model. Incorporating the sub-grid scale parameterization in the coarse-resolution model (16m) leads to improved predictions of overland flow and erosion when evaluated using results derived from high-resolution (0.5m) model simulations. The improvement in performance is observed for a range of event magnitudes and is most notable for erosion estimates due to the non-linear dependency between the rates of erosion and overland flow.

AB The Community Collaborative Rain, Hail & Snow (CoCoRaHS) Network is a community-based network of weather observers and the largest provider of daily precipitation observations in the USA. In this study, we embrace the CoCoRaHS mission to use low-cost measurement tools, provide training and education, and utilize an interactive website to create the first volunteer snow albedo network to collect high-quality albedo data for research and education applications. We trained a sub-set of 18 CoCoRaHS observers in the state of New Hampshire to collect albedo, snow depth, and snow density between 23 November 2011 and 15 March 2012. At less than $700 per observer, CoCoRAHS data measured using an Apogee MP-200 pyranometer fall within +/- 0.05 of albedo values collected from a Kipp and Zonen CMA6 at local solar noon. CoCoRAHS values range from 0.99 for fresh snow to 0.34 for shallow, aged snow. Snow-free albedo ranges from 0.09 to 0.39, depending on the underlying ground cover. In the 2011/2012 dataset, albedo increases logarithmically with snow depth and decreases linearly with snow density. The latter relationship is inferred to be a proxy for increasing snow grain size as snowpack ages and compacts, supported by spectral albedo measurements collected with an Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec 4 spectrometer.

AB This study examines the characteristics of winter (Dec-Feb) rain-on-snow events and their relationship to surface air temperatures to reveal potential changes in rain-on-snow days under a warming climate over northern Eurasia. We found that rain-on-snow events mostly occur over European Russia during winter. Rain-on-snow days increase as air temperature increases and are primarily attributable to the increase in rainfall days. Air temperature is the primary cause for these changes, while the North Atlantic Oscillation has some influence on the rain on snow and rainfall over the northern part of European Russia. The magnitude of rain-on-snow increase ranges from 0.5 day to 2.5 days per degree Celsius increase in air temperature. Higher rates of increase in rain-on-snow days occur in the northern and eastern parts of European Russia where the air temperature is lower, in contrast to rainfall days which have higher rates at locations with higher air temperatures. This suggests that a decrease in snowfall days might be limiting the rate of increase in rain-on-snow events over warmer regions where the temperature is about -8 degrees C or higher. This study also implies that rain-on-snow days will become more common over regions in which it is currently a rare event as air temperatures increase. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB For various hydrological applications such as flood control projects, a knowledge of stage-discharge relationship is of particular interest to river engineers. Stage-discharge curves in compound channels cannot be easily predicted in comparison with single channels due to their 3D characteristics of flow. In this paper, the concept of cross-sectional isovel contours is used for estimation of stage-discharge curves in compound channels. The multivariate Newton's method is applied to the difference between the observed and estimated data to optimize the exponent values of the governing parameters. The accuracy of the proposed model is tested successfully against available experimental results, which are taken from the Flood Channel Facility (FCF) laboratory. Then the results are compared with the Single and Divided Channel Methods (SCM and DCM, respectively), the Weighted Divided Channel Method (WDCM), the exchange discharge method (EDM), and the Coherence Method (COHM). The average values of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) in discharge estimation based on each referenced section at any level for 6 sections of the experimental cases are within 3.1% and 0.023, respectively. The biggest advantage of the proposed method is its inherent simplicity, which does not need any calibration.

AB The effects of variability in climate and watershed (groundwater withdrawal and land use) on dry-weather streamflows were investigated using SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool). The equation to predict the total runoff (TR) using climate data was derived from simulation results for 30 years by multiple regression analysis. These may be used to estimate effects of various climate variations (precipitation during the dry period. precipitation during the previous wet period, solar radiation, and maximum temperature). For example, if daily average maximum temperature increases by 3 degrees C, TR during the dry period will decrease by 27.9%. Similarly, groundwater withdrawals strongly affect streamflow during the dry period. However, land use changes (increasing urbanization) within the forested watershed do not appear to significantly affect TR during the dry period. Finally. a combined equation was derived that describes the relationships between the TR during the dry period and the climate, groundwater withdrawal and urban area proportion in a small monsoon watershed. This equation will be effective to predict the water availability during the dry periods in the future since it is closely related to changes of temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, urban area ratio, and groundwater withdrawal quantity.

AB Seasonally dry forests in tropical regions show over 300% inter-annual biomass variability that directly affects the runoff and erosion dynamics. However, biomass fluctuation is mostly overlooked in hydrosedimentological analysis, including in connectivity analysis. The aim of this paper is to understand how the dryland vegetation seasonality in Brazilian drylands affects the potential runoff and sediment connectivity using the Index of Connectivity (stream and outlet targets). Two main analytical steps were used to identify the influence of dry forest biomass fluctuation on connectivity: Creation of vegetation scenarios based on the relationship between rainfall patterns and NDVI fluctuations (Landsat images); Identification of the effect of the vegetation scenarios on Index of Connectivity. The method was applied to a 90 km(2) watershed in NE Brazil, creating a daily vegetation classification using five vegetation scenarios related to rainfall parameters, with average NDVI values from 0.18 during very dry scenarios (<20 mm of antecedent rainfall) to 0.62 in very wet scenario (>500 mm of antecedent rainfall). The primary connectivity behaviour is controlled by a continuous connectivity decrease, reaching 32%, related to increase of humidity and vegetation biomass. At the same time, due to rainfall irregularity, high magnitude rainfall events can occur even during very dry scenarios, when the watershed shows very high potential connectivity. It indicates that connectivity in runoff-dominated regions is temporally variable due to the highly seasonal vegetation and variable incidence of intense rainstorms.

AB Evaluating performances of four commonly used evaporation estimate methods, namely; Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB), mass transfer (NIT), Priestley-Taylor (PT) and pan evaporation (PE), based on 4 years experimental data, the most effective and the reliable evaporation estimates model for the semi-arid region of India has been derived. The various goodness-of-fit measures, such as; coefficient of determination (R-2), index of agreement (D), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative bias (RB) have been chosen for the performance evaluation. Of these models, the PT model has been found most promising when the Bowen ratio, beta is known a priori, and based on its limited data requirement. The responses of the BREB, the PT, and the PE models were found comparable to each other, while the response of the NIT model differed to match with the responses of the other three models. The coefficients, beta of the BREB, mu of the NIT, alpha of the PT and K-P of the PE model were estimated as 0.07, 2.35, 1.31 and 0.65, respectively. The PT model can successfully be extended for free water surface evaporation estimates in semi-arid India.
   A linear regression model depicting relationship between daily air and water temperature has been developed using the observed water temperatures and the corresponding air temperatures. The model helped to generate unrecorded water temperatures for the corresponding ambient air temperatures. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB As stated by many authors in the recent past, soil erosion is one of the major environmental problems in southern Africa and it will become even more severe in the future due to population growth and potential climatic changes. This study concerns the detection of different land degradation stages in semi-arid grassland areas in the upper Mbuluzi-river catchment (Kingdom of Swaziland). It has been carried out within the framework of an interdisciplinary EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated water resources management system (IWRMS) for water resources analyses and prognostic scenario planning in semi-arid catchments of Southern Africa (Flugel et al., 2001 URL: http://www.iwrms.uni-jena.de/download/Eu-reports/report_final.pdf). Within this more general framework, particular attention was focused on the determination of high-resolution morphometric parameters for detailed erosion process studies, as well as on the derivation of relationships between vegetation cover and bare soil. The latter has subsequently been used to delineate the vegetation cover density and C-factor values for erosion models such as the revised universal soil loss equation. The examples from Southern Africa show that the methods applied are able to identify areas affected by different types of erosion. Furthermore, it is possible to estimate the parameters for a subsequent erosion modelling. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Oxygen fluxes through artificially created salmon redds within four UK rivers were quantified and assessed against survival to hatching of Atlantic salmon embryos. All sites recorded high spatial variability in survival. Minimum survival to hatching was zero at all sites. Maximum survival to hatching ranged from 35% to 91%. Mean survival to hatching ranged from 8.7% to 71 %.
   Intra- and inter-site variations in rates of oxygen supply were observed. Generally, interstitial dissolved oxygen concentrations declined over the incubation period from a maximum recorded directly after redd creation, although localized fluctuations were recorded. Similarly, interstitial flow velocities declined over the incubation period from a maximum directly after redd creation to a minimum at hatching. With respect to the causes of embryo mortalities, oxygen supply was shown to be a stronger determinant of survival than interstitial oxygen concentration or interstitial flow velocity.
   To improve delineation of potential causes of embryo mortalities in the field, the statistical analysis was integrated within mass transfer theory of the processes controlling respiration to determine the likely mechanisms inhibiting respiration. Based on this analysis, mortalities were assessed to have resulted from periods of lethal oxygen concentrations, from periods of interstitial flow velocities that were insufficient to remove metabolic waste, or from combinations of oxygen concentration and interstitial flow that did not support respiratory requirements. A set of oxygen-supply-related thresholds for assessing incubation habitat quality are proposed. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Based on the theory of gravity-driven groundwater flow systems, we have developed a complex Flow System Sand-Box Model (FSM). It enables the visual observations of the development and characteristics and temporal evolution of complex Tothian flow systems in the laboratory. The configuration of the regional, intermediate and local flow systems can be controlled and observed; hydraulic head, flow direction and travel time can be measured; and the scale and shape of the sub-flow systems as well as the path lines and flow lines can be observed directly. The experiments demonstrate the Tothian flow systems in a small basin with multiple sources and sinks. Greater local topographic (water table) undulation will lead to larger local flow systems. Greater regional and less local topographic undulation will enhance the development of intermediate and regional flow systems. In homogeneous media, increasing fluid-potential differences between source and sink increase the spatial scale of the generated flow systems. The FSM is a useful teaching aid and experimental device to study and develop an intuitive insight into gravity-driven groundwater flow systems. It helps to visualize and understand the hydraulic properties and controlling factors of Tothian flow systems and may be used to study problems related to the chemical and temperature characteristics of the flow systems as well.

AB The hydrological effects of forest cover loss are difficult to discern in the case of large-scale basins with gradual changes and difficult to isolate when climate variability is also present. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of climate variability and human activity on the annual streamflow in a basin in the Amazon arc of deforestation. We statistically analyzed the components of the annual water balance and monthly streamflow and used the currently used Tomer-Schilling, elasticity, and decomposition of Budyko-type curve methods to separate climate-induced changes and anthropogenic effects. Annual series of the monthly maximum and minimum streamflow, total streamflow, and total reference evapotranspiration presented statistically significant increasing trends. No significant trend was observed for precipitation. The greatest change in the average annual runoff coefficient was observed between the first (1973-1984) and second (1985-1994) analyzed periods. Even with the continuous reduction in the forested area, the third (1994-2004) and fourth analyzed periods (2003-2016) showed only relatively small changes, most likely due to the intensity of slash-and-burn activities and vegetation regrowth. The methods showed that deforestation was the primary cause of the streamflow changes, but with different intensities, and a small recuperation was observed in the last analyzed period. On average, the annual water yield would increase between 26% and 58% after the first time interval without the opposite effect of climate variability, which must be considered in basin management. Future research should focus on analyzing the water storage and the dependence of the precipitation-runoff relationship from the climate.
   Plain Language Summary The effects of deforestation on water availability are difficult to discern in the case of large river basins and when there are also changes in the climate. We evaluated the effects of both, climate variability and human activities, on the annual average river flow in a water basin situated in the most deforested region of the Amazon biome. Statistical analyzes showed that there were significant increases in the average annual flow of the river and in the annual reference evapotranspiration (determined by the climate) during the years after the beginning of deforestation in the region, but not in precipitation. The greatest change in the percentage of precipitation that turns into streamflow was observed between the first (1973-1984) and second (1985-1994) analyzed periods. Even with the continuous of deforestation in the basin, the other periods (1994-2004 and 2003-2016) showed only relatively small changes, most likely due to vegetation regrowth. Three different methods showed that deforestation was the primary cause of the streamflow change, but annual streamflow would be between 26% and 58% greater without the opposite effect of climate. These results must be considered in the management of water resources in the region.

AB This study presents copula-based multivariate probabilistic approach to model severitydurationfrequency (S-D-F) relationship of drought events in western Rajasthan, India. Drought occurrences are analysed using standardized precipitation index computed on monthly mean areal precipitation, aggregated at a time scale of 6?months. After testing with a series of probability density functions, the drought variable severity is found to be better represented with log-normal distribution, whereas duration is well fitted with exponential distribution. Four different classes of bivariate copulas Archimedean, extreme value, Plackett, and elliptical families are evaluated for modelling joint distribution of drought characteristics. It is observed that the extreme value copula GumbelHougaard copula performed better as compared with other classes of copulas, based on results of various statistical tests and upper tail dependence coefficient. The joint distribution obtained from best performing copula is then employed to determine conditional return period and to derive drought severity-duration-frequency (S-D-F) curves for the study region. The results of the study suggests that the copula method can be used effectively to derive the drought S-D-F curves, which can be helpful in planning and adopting suitable drought mitigation strategies in drought-prone areas.

AB In this study, a dynamic flood-frequency analysis model considering the storm coverage effect is proposed and applied to six sub-basins in the Pyungchang River basin, Korea. The model proposed is composed of the rectangular pulse Poisson process model for rainfall, the Soil Conservation Service curve number method for infiltration and the geomorphoclimatic instantaneous unit hydrograph for runoff estimation. Also, the model developed by Marco and Valdes is adopted for quantifying the storm-coverage characteristics. By comparing the results from the same model with and without the storm-coverage effect consideration, we could quantify the storm-coverage effect on the flood-frequency analysis. As a result of that, we found the storm-coverage effect was so significant that overestimation of the design flood was unavoidable without its consideration. This also becomes more serious for larger basins where the probability of complete storm coverage is quite low. However, for smaller basins, the limited number of rain gauges is found to hamper the proper quantification of the storm-coverage characteristics. Provided with a relationship curve between the basin size and the storm coverage (as in this study), this problem could be overcome with an acceptable accuracy level.

AB The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence that minimum temperature, average temperature, and maximum temperature have on yield when using the iGAEZ model. Simulated yields on each grid cell for 1980-1999, in three leading producers of wheat, rice and maize, were combined with climate datasets to evaluate the relationships between temperature and simulated crop yields. A generalized additive model was evaluated to analyse changes in diurnal temperature range (DTR) and crop yields. Results differ depending on crop and region as to whether there was a clear positive/negative response of yields to daily temperature indices (DTIs) (including DTR, Tmax, Tmin and Tave). However, the effects of DTIs were statistically significant using a generalized additive model for all crops and regions. To evaluate whether future changes in DTIs are relevant for impact assessment, yield responses to projected changes in DTIs by 2080-2099, from 19 climate models under SRES A2, B1 scenarios, were estimated. Among DTIs, DTR changes did significantly affect yield responses in several cases, such as in maize and rice yields in South Asia under B1 scenario. The decreasing/increasing trend of DTIs has an important implication for estimating the future impact of climate changes. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The continuing rapid expansion of industrial and consumer processes based on nanoparticles (NP) necessitates a robust model for delineating their fate and transport in groundwater. An ability to reliably specify the full parameter set for prediction of NP transport using continuum models is crucial. In this paper we report the reanalysis of a data set of 493 published column experiment outcomes together with their continuum modeling results. Experimental properties were parameterized into 20 factors which are commonly available. They were then used to predict five key continuum model parameters as well as the effluent concentration via artificial neural network (ANN)-based correlations. The Partial Derivatives (PaD) technique and Monte Carlo method were used for the analysis of sensitivities and model-produced uncertainties, respectively. The outcomes shed light on several controversial relationships between the parameters, e.g., it was revealed that the trend of K-att with average pore water velocity was positive. The resulting correlations, despite being developed based on a "black-box" technique (ANN), were able to explain the effects of theoretical parameters such as critical deposition concentration (CDC), even though these parameters were not explicitly considered in the model. Porous media heterogeneity was considered as a parameter for the first time and showed sensitivities higher than those of dispersivity. The model performance was validated well against subsets of the experimental data and was compared with current models. The robustness of the correlation matrices was not completely satisfactory, since they failed to predict the experimental breakthrough curves (BTCs) at extreme values of ionic strengths.
   Plain Language Summary Models based on advection-dispersion-equation (ADE), have succeeded in describing a variety of nanoparticle (NP) transport mechanisms within subsurface porous media. These models are usually fitted against known observation data to obtain the unknown parameters. Nevertheless, the parameters determined in this way cannot be used for a new problem of the same type and again there exists the need for the data to calibrate the model parameters for a new problem. Black box models, such as artificial neural network (ANN), have been mostly, if not all the times, used in the same way of ADE models, i.e., single problem solver. In this paper we use the ability of ANN to develop a series of simple correlation matrices that can be easily used for the prediction of ADE parameters in the new problem without the need for additional calibration. Although comparisons between ANN model predictions and experimental data show that there is still further work to be done, our approach out-performs other comparable models and offers new insight into the complex interactions among the factors determining NP transport and fate in the environment.

AB Soil evaporation plays an important role in non-productive water loss and local climate regulation. The deviation of the relationship between delta D and delta O-18 in surface soil water from that in precipitation is used to indicate the integrative results of the soil evaporation process, but the distinction between the slope of the soil water evaporation line (SEL) and line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) as individual indicators has not been identified. Furthermore, spatial variability and interaction effects of climate, soil, and vegetation on soil evaporation in arid and semi-arid grasslands remain poorly understood. We established 3 west-to-east sampling transects along with increasing precipitation and decreasing aridity index gradients in grasslands of the Tibetan (TP, 1500 km), Loess (LP, 600 km), and Inner Mongolia (MP, 1200 km) Plateaus. Slope of SEL and weighted mean lc-excess were calculated according to the delta D and delta O-18 in soil water, which was extracted from soils collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 1 m along with soil profiles during the vigorous growing season. We found that lc-excess appeared relatively more robust than slope in representing soil evaporation process because lc-excess was determined by evaporation fractionation factors and soil residual water storage, while slope was regulated only by evaporation fractionation factors. Soil evaporation, as indicated by lc-excess, exhibited decreasing trends from west to east, and was controlled by relative humidity in TP, and by vegetation coverage in LP and MP. Our results highlighted that the soil evaporation process may be more sensitive to climate change in TP, and vegetation restoration in LP and MP.

AB [1] In hydraulic groundwater theory the parameter drainable porosity f ( a storage coefficient that accounts for the effect of the unsaturated zone on water table dynamics) is usually treated as a constant. For shallow unconfined aquifers the value of this parameter, however, depends on the depth to the water table and the water retention characteristics of the soil. In this study an analytical expression for f as a function of water table depth is derived under the assumption of quasi-steady state hydraulic equilibrium, in this way accounting, in part, for the effects of the unsaturated zone on groundwater dynamics. The derived expression is implemented in the nonlinear hillslope-storage Boussinesq (HSB) model ( Troch et al., 2003) to simulate the drainage response of complex hillslopes. The model's behavior is analyzed by comparison to ( 1) the HSB model with a constant value for f and ( 2) measurements of water tables and outflow hydrographs on a 6.0 x 2.5 x 0.5 m laboratory hillslope experiment. The comparison is conducted for a pure drainage case on two different hillslope shapes ( linearly convergent and divergent) and for three different slope inclinations (5%, 10%, and 15%). Comparison 1 is run in an uncalibrated and a fully calibrated mode, and it enables us to evaluate the effect of a dynamic, state-dependent value for f on model output. Comparison 2 allows us to test the HSB model on several hillslope configurations and to analyze whether the concept of a storage-dependent f enhances the model performance. The comparison of the HSB models to the measurements from the laboratory hillslopes shows that it is possible to capture the general features of the outflow hydrograph during a drainage experiment using either one of the HSB models. Overall, the original ( constant f) HSB model, with one fitting parameter more than the revised HSB model, shows a slightly better fit on the hydrographs when compared to the revised ( variable f) HSB model. However, the peak outflow values ( the first few minutes after initiation of the experiments) are better captured by the revised HSB model. The revised HSB model's performance in simulating water table movements is much more accurate than that of the original HSB model. The improved match of the revised HSB model to piezometric measurements is worth stressing because the ability to model water tables is a key attribute of the model, making it possible to investigate phenomena such as saturation excess runoff. Also noteworthy is the good match between the revised HSB model and the outflow measurements, without any calibration, for the divergent slopes. The changing values of the calibrated drainable porosity parameter for the original HSB model as different configurations are simulated ( slope angle, plan shape, initial conditions), together with the ability of the revised HSB model to more accurately simulate water table dynamics, clearly demonstrates the importance of regarding drainable porosity as a dynamic, storage-dependent parameter.

AB Understanding the role of soil moisture and other controls in runoff generation is important for predicting runoff across scales. This paper aims to identify the degree of non-linearity of the relationship between event peak runoff and potential controls for different runoff generation mechanisms in a small agricultural catchment. The study is set in the 66 ha Hydrological Open Air Laboratory, Austria, where discharge was measured at the catchment outlet and for 11 sub-catchments or hillslopes with different runoff generation mechanisms. Peak runoff of 73 events was related to three potential controls: event precipitation, soil moisture and groundwater levels. The results suggest that the hillslopes dominated by ephemeral overland flow exhibit the most non-linear runoff generation behaviour for its controls; runoff is only generated above a threshold of 95% of the maximum soil moisture. Runoff generation through tile drains and in wetlands is more linear. The largest winter and spring events at the catchment outlet are caused by runoff from hillslopes with shallow flow paths (ephemeral overland flow and tile drainage mechanisms), while the largest summer events are caused by other hillslopes, those with deeper flow paths or with saturation areas throughout the year. Therefore, the response of the entire catchment is a mix of the various mechanisms, and the groundwater contribution makes the response more linear. The implications for hydrological modelling are discussed.

AB Drought hotspot identification requires continuous drought monitoring and spatial risk assessment. The present study analysed drought events in the agriculture-dominated mid-Mahanadi River Basin in Odisha, India, using crop water stress as a drought indicator. This drought index incorporated different factors that affect crop water deficit such as the cropping pattern, soil characteristics, and surface soil moisture. The drought monitoring framework utilized a relevance vector machine model-based classification that provided the uncertainty associated with drought categorization. Using the proposed framework, drought hotspots are identified in the study region and compared with indices based on precipitation and soil moisture. Further, a bivariate copula is employed to model the agricultural drought characteristics and develop the drought severity-duration-frequency (S-D-F) relationships. The drought hotspot maps and S-D-F curves are developed for different locations in the region. These provided useful information on the site-specific drought patterns and the characteristics of the devastating droughts of 2002 and 2012, characterized by an average drought duration of 7 months at several locations. The site-specific risk of short- and long-term agricultural droughts are then investigated using the conditional copula. The results suggest that the conditional return periods and the S-D-F curves are valuable tools to assess the spatial variability of drought risk in the region.

AB This study documented the spatial and temporal variability of outflow from a forested hillslope segment during snowmelt at a small mountain catchment in south coastal British Columbia, Canada. A pit 5 m wide was established just upslope from the stream channel. Outflow from the organic horizon was intercepted and measured by a single trough, and outflow from the mineral horizons was measured separately for three adjacent sections. Throughflow exhibited non-steady-state behaviour involving shifting allocations of flow amongst different sections of the outflow pit, as well as threshold effects and hysteresis in the relationship between pit outflow and water table elevation. Most of the pit outflow originated from the mineral horizons, indicating that throughflow was the dominant pathway by which water was delivered to the stream channel. Direct precipitation and snowmelt onto near-stream saturated areas can account for less than 20% of the total outflow from the hillslope segment. Throughflow from the mineral sections consistently peaked either at the same time as or earlier than stream flow from the 150-ha catchment during diurnal snowmelt cycles, indicating that throughflow appears to respond rapidly enough to contribute to snowmelt-induced peak stream flow. Pit outflow cannot be extrapolated reliably to the catchment scale on the basis of simple length- or area-based ratios. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper examines the conservativeness of tracers through the sediment generation process. This is done by comparing a selection of tracer properties of sediment eroded from large plots by simulated rainfall, with the corresponding properties of the source materials within the plots. Sediment was generated using three simulated rainfall events for each of rive selected erosion source types in the Tarago catchment, Victoria, Australia. As there were particle size and organic content differences between the source material and the generated sediment, the measured tracer properties of the source material were corrected for these differences. The possible role of analytical errors in this investigation was also addressed. The gechemical property, concentration of Fe2O3, was not conservative for any of the process sources investigated. Concentration of Al2O3, was not conservative for three of the four process sources investigated, and the sum of molecular proportions of CaO**, Na2O, K2O and Al2O3 was not conservative for two of the four process sources investigated. Mineral magnetic properties, IRM850 and X were also found to be not conservative, although this may be the result of the complex relationship between particle size and mineral magnetic properties not being adequately accommodated in this analysis. The radionuclide tracers, Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex), were found to be conservative through the sediment generation process. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Historically, hydrological models have been developed to represent land-atmosphere interactions by simulating water storage and water fluxes. These models, however, have their own unique characteristics (strength and weakness) in capturing different aspects of the water cycle, and their results are typically compared to or calibrated against in-situ observations such as river runoff measurements. As a result, there may be gross inaccuracies in the estimation of water storage states produced by these models. In this study, we present the novel approach of Dynamic Model Data Averaging (DMDA), which can be used to compare and merge mull-model water storage simulations with monthly Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS, a vertical summation of surface and sub-surface water storage) estimates from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Here, the main hypothesis is that merging GRACE data with mull-model outputs likely provides more skillful hydrological estimations compared to a single model or data set. Theoretically, the proposed DMDA combines the benefits of the Kalman Filter (KF) and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) techniques and has the capability to deal with various observations and models with different error structures. Based on the Bayes theory, DMDA provides time-variable weights for hydrological models to compute an average of their outputs that are best fired to GRACE TWS estimates. Numerically, the DMDA method is implemented by integrating the output of six hydrological and land surface models (PCR-GLOBWB, SURFEX-TRIP, LISFLOOD, HBV-SIMREG, W3RA, and ORCHIDEE) and monthly GRACE TWS estimates (2002-2012) within the world's 33 largest river basins, while considering the inherent uncertainties of all inputs. Our results indicate that DMDA correctly separates GRACE TWS estimates into surface water, soil moisture and groundwater compartments. Linear trends fitted to the DMDA-derived groundwater compartment are found to be different from those of original models. This means that anthropogenic influences within the GRACE data, which are not well reflected by models, are introduced by DMDA. We also find that temporal correlation coefficients between the DMDA-derived individual water storage estimations (surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater) and the El Nirio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index are considerably increased compared to those derived between individual model simulations and ENSO (e.g., an increase from -0.2 to 0.6 in the Murray River Basin). For the Nile River Basin, they changed from 0.1 to 0.4 for the soil moisture, and from 0.3 to 0.7 for the surface water compartment. Comparisons between the DMDA-derived surface water and those from independent satellite altimetry observations indicate that after implementing DMDA, temporal correlation coefficients within major lakes are increased. Based on these results, we have gained confidence in the DMDA water storage estimates to be used for improving the characterization of water storage over broad regions of the globe.

AB In this article, we propose an investigation of the modifications of the hydrological response of two Peruvian AmazonasAndes basins in relationship with the modifications of the precipitation and evapotranspiration rates inferred by the IPCC. These two basins integrate around 10% of the total area of the Amazonian basin. These estimations are based on the application of two monthly hydrological models, GR2M and MWB3, and the climatic projections come from BCM2, CSMK3 and MIHR models for A1B and B1 emission scenarios (SCE A1B and SCE B1). Projections are approximated by two simple scenarios (anomalies and horizon) and annual rainfall rates, evapotranspiration rates and discharge were estimated for the 2020s (20082040), 2050s (20412070) and 2080s (20712099). Annual discharge shows increasing trend over Requena basin (Ucayali river), Puerto Inca basin (Pachitea river), Tambo basin (Tambo river) and Mejorada basin (Mantaro river) while discharge shows decreasing trend over the Chazuta basin (Huallaga river), the Maldonadillo basin (Urubamba river) and the Pisac basin (Vilcanota river). Monthly discharge at the outlet of Puerto Inca, Tambo and Mejorada basins shows increasing trends for all seasons. Trends to decrease are estimated in autumn discharge over the Requena basin and spring discharge over Pisac basin as well as summer and autumn discharges over both the Chazuta and the Maldonadillo basins.

AB For ecosystem modelling of the Boreal forest it is important to include processes associated with low soil temperature during spring-early summer, as these affect the tree water uptake. The COUP model, a physically based SVAT model, was tested with 2 years of soil and snow physical measurements and sap flow measurements in a 70-year-old Scots pine stand in the boreal zone of northern Sweden. During the first year the extent and duration of soil frost was manipulated in the field. The model was successful in reproducing the timing of the soil warming after the snowmelt and frost thaw. A delayed soil warming, into the growing season, severely reduced the transpiration. We demonstrated the potential for considerable overestimation of transpiration by the model if the reduction of the trees' capacity to transpire due to low soil temperatures is not taken into account. We also demonstrated that the accumulated effect of aboveground conditions could be included when simulating the relationship between soil temperature and tree water uptake. This improved the estimated transpiration for the control plot and when soil warming was delayed into the growing season. The study illustrates the need of including antecedent conditions on root growth in the model in order to catch these effects on transpiration. The COUP model is a promising tool for predicting transpiration in high-latitude stands. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB An accurate understanding of the fresh-saline distribution of groundwater is necessary for effective groundwater management. Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys offer a rapid and cost-effective method with which to map this, offering valuable additional information about the subsurface. To convert AEM data into electric conductivity and ultimately groundwater salinity, an inversion is undertaken. A number of algorithms are available for this purpose; however, these are affected by significant uncertainty, owing to inherent nonunique characteristics of this process. The most commonly used inversion codes in hydrogeophysical studies were quantitatively tested using frequency domain AEM and ground data from the province of Zeeland, the Netherlands. These include UBC1DFM code and quasi-2D laterally constrained inversions. Following an investigation of inversion parameter settings, data were inverted for four inversion methods and interpolated into 3-D volumes. Using geological data and empirical electrical conductivity and water salinity relationships, each inversion was converted into groundwater electrical conductivity and split into fresh-brackish-saline regions. For groundwater volume estimates out of a total volume of 2.8 billion m(3), a fresh groundwater estimate could differ by as much as 178 million m(3), depending on the inversion used. The primary factor here was the choice of model smoothness, which was shown to affect the thickness of the brackish interval. Fresh-brackish-saline interfaces were consistently mapped with an accuracy of similar to 3 m, the brackish being the most accurately resolved. The few layer method was less successful at resolving smoothly varying salinity distributions but more successful at mapping the brackish interface at greater depth.
   Plain Language Summary Understanding the current distribution of groundwater salinity in low-elevation coastal zones is important because globally over 600 million people live and potentially rely on fresh groundwater in these areas. Fresh groundwater is also vulnerable to a process called saline intrusion, where usable groundwater can be displaced by less-usable saline groundwater. Groundwater salinity on more regional scales is currently mapped by an instrument that is towed beneath a helicopter. This technique measures electromagnetic responses that relate mostly to salinity variations within groundwater reserves. For these measurements to make sense, they need to be transformed into units that can physically relate to groundwater salinity. This process is called inversion. However, as this procedure comes with significant uncertainty, there are a number of different algorithms available for this. Here we used airborne and ground data from the province of Zeeland, the Netherlands, and tested eight inversion algorithms that are commonly used for this purpose. Results indicate that based on the inversion type, fresh groundwater estimates in a volume of 2.8 billion m(3) could differ by up to 178 million m(3). Finally, it was shown that according to mapping objectives, the type of inversion needs to be selected carefully to maximize the use of the highly valuable airborne data.

AB There is a renewed focus on the design of infrastructure resilient to extreme hydrometeorological events. While precipitation-based intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are commonly used as part of infrastructure design, a large percentage of peak runoff events in snow-dominated regions are caused by snowmelt, particularly during rain-on-snow (ROS) events. In these regions, precipitation-based IDF curves may lead to substantial overestimation/underestimation of design basis events and subsequent overdesign/underdesign of infrastructure. To overcome this deficiency, we proposed next-generation IDF (NG-IDF) curves, which characterize the actual water reaching the land surface. We compared NG-IDF curves to standard precipitation-based IDF curves for estimates of extreme events at 376 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations across the western United States that each had at least 30 years of high-quality records. We found standard precipitation-based IDF curves at 45% of the stations were subject to underdesign, many with significant underestimation of 100 year extreme events, for which the precipitation-based IDF curves can underestimate water potentially available for runoff by as much as 125% due to snowmelt and ROS events. The regions with the greatest potential for underdesign were in the Pacific Northwest, the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and the Middle and Southern Rockies. We also found the potential for overdesign at 20% of the stations, primarily in the Middle Rockies and Arizona mountains. These results demonstrate the need to consider snow processes in the development of IDF curves, and they suggest use of the more robust NG-IDF curves for hydrologic design in snow-dominated environments.
   Plain Language Summary Recent natural disasters highlight the need for proper hydrologic design of infrastructure to accommodate extreme flood events. Hydraulic structures such as flood drainage systems are typically designed to convey a storm of a given duration and frequency of occurrence (e.g., the 100 year, 24 h storm event). These events are characterized by curves of a given frequency showing the relationship between precipitation intensity and duration (i.e., IDF curves). In locations with significant snowfall, standard precipitation-based IDF curves fail to capture the snowmelt and rain-on-snow events which may lead to substantial overestimation/underestimation of design basis events used for infrastructure. This study proposed next-generation IDF (NG-IDF) curves to overcome this deficiency. We used observed daily precipitation and changes in snow water equivalent at 376 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations to construct and compare standard precipitation and NG-IDF curves for estimates of extreme events across the western United States. Standard precipitation-based IDF curves were subject to underdesign at 45% of the stations in the Pacific Northwest, the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and the Middle and Southern Rockies. Underestimation of 100 year, 24 h events can be as much as 125%. These results suggest use of the more robust NG-IDF curves for hydrologic design in snow-dominated environments.

AB Nitrate contamination is a significant unresolved environmental issue for agriculture in the 21st century, with longstanding challenges in its control and allocation to a specified territory. In order to address these challenges, real-world meticulous irrigation area studies are required. The objective of this investigation is to analyze the evolution of nitrate contamination in relation to agronomic and management changes within a traditionally irrigated land. Specifically, the impact of changes in irrigation allowance assignment, changes in irrigation method from rotation to on-demand flood irrigation, and creation of water consumption accounts were analyzed.
   To this end, nitrogen monitoring and annual balances were carried out in a small irrigated hydrological basin (95 ha) located in Northeastern Spain throughout the years of 2001 and 2005-2008. The evolution of the nitrate contamination index was also analyzed, which relates the mass of nitrates exported to the fertilization necessities of a specific irrigated area.
   The results demonstrated that although changes in crop pattern caused a 33% reduction in the nitrogen required through fertilization, the fertilization rates applied are still double the necessities. Changes in irrigation management decreased the mass of nitrates exported by half and the nitrate contamination index by 24%, but the nitrate levels present are still approximately double of those registered in modern irrigation areas.
   The changes implemented by the Irrigation District in the irrigation management were effective. However, this study confirms that a greater effort is still required to achieve adequate nitrogen fertilization matching the crop necessities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydraulic connectivity on hillslopes and the existence of preferred soil moisture states in a catchment have important controls on runoff generation. In this study we investigate the relationships between soil moisture patterns, lateral hillslope flow, and streamflow generation in a semi-arid, snowmelt-driven catchment. We identiy five soil moisture conditions that occur during a year and present a conceptual model based on field studies and computer simulations of how streamflow is generated with respect to the soil moisture conditions. The five soil moisture conditions are (1) a summer dry period, (2) a transitional fall wetting period, (3) a winter wet, low-flux period, (4) a spring wet, high-flux period, and (5) a transitional late-spring drying period. Transitions between the periods are driven by changes in the water balance between rain, snow, snowmelt and evapotranspiration. Low rates of water input to the soil during the winter allow dry soil regions to persist at the soil-bedrock interface, which act as barriers to lateral flow. Once the dry-soil flow barriers are wetted, whole-slope hydraulic connectivity is established, lateral flow can occur, and upland soils are in direct connection with the near-stream soil moisture. This whole-slope connectivity can alter near-stream hydraulics and modify the delivery of water, pressure, and solutes to the stream. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Although floods in arid environments have been documented, considerable uncertainties still exist as to the floodwater and in-channel infiltration relationships. In desert alluvial channels, the prime cause of flood discharge attenuation is water loss by infiltration into the alluvium. The present study documents flows in Nahal Zin, Israel, their infiltration into the channel bed, and the resultant change in the alluvium moisture content. The study uses a systematic combination of two experimental scales, the cross-section scale and the reach scale. Direct measurements of moisture distribution in the active channel during floods were made using time domain reflectometry. Twelve flow events were recorded. Flow patterns and their respective alluvium moisture content were analysed. A trench was dug in the alluvium for the study of alluvium properties and time domain reflectometry sensor installation. The alluvium was characterized in terms of size distribution and sediment stratigraphy, structure, and composition. Two main alluvial structures (closed and open) affected the advance of the wetting front and water losses. Alluvial units with an open structure (clast-supported) reached their maximum moisture content faster than closed structure units (matrix-supported). Small-sized particles and matrix-supported layers reduced infiltration rate. The measured velocities of the wetting front were 0.33 and 2.88mh(-1) for small and large floods respectively. The wetting front moved downward. Lateral movement was negligible. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Kinmen is located in the south-west of Mainland China and mainly has two islands, Large Kinmen and Leiyu. Residents in Kinmen have drunk groundwater over several decades. This work characterized the quality of groundwater in Kinmen using factor analysis (FA), cluster analysis (CA) and geochemical simulation. The factor scores were plotted spatially to illustrate the groundwater quality and were used to discuss the grouped relationship using CA. Salinization, redox and organic matter factors are identified from 17 hydrochemical measurements in 18 wells. Acidic and oxidizing groundwater with nitrate-N pollution is distributed mainly in the west of Large Kinmen. Saline groundwater is distributed to the north-east of Large Kinmen and in the south of Leiyu. Groundwater with organic matter is present throughout Leiyu. Five groups of the groundwater quality divided by CA can be interpreted according to one to three factors. The grouped characteristics of the groundwater quality help the local government and industries to plan the use and protection of groundwater resources. Furthermore, a geochemical simulation was used to demonstrate the formation processes of the acidic and oxidizing groundwater properties in granitic sediments. A large amount of the precipitation of the kaolinite and magnetite releases concentrations of hydrogen ion and raises the redox potential in the aquifers. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A two reservoir conceptual model with a hysteretic transfer function is proposed for hydrological modelling of karst catchments. The main features of the model are (i) a simple model for evapotranspiration based on potential rates, (ii) a non-linear, hysteretic discharge law accounting for the variations of connectivity in the soil/epikarst zone, (iii) a threshold-based discharge law accounting for the time variability of the active catchment area via losses to secondary springs. The structure of the model and the governing equations are proposed on the basis of physical considerations, with the underlying assumption that the model compartments, state variables and parameters should bear a physical reality. The model is applied to the karst system catchment of the Durzon spring (France). Model robustness is assessed by using only 1 year for calibration and 4 years for validation. A modified Nash-Sutcliffe criterion decreases from 91% to 87% between the calibration and validation phase, thus demonstrating the robustness of the model. The proposed model is compared to a model of similar complexity available from the literature, previously applied to similar catchments. The comparison indicates the superiority of the hysteresis-based model in terms of robustness and overall performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorus (P) concentrations in sediments and in surface and interstitial water from three gravel bars in a large river (Garonne River, southern France) were measured daily, downstream of a wastewater treatment plant for a city of 740000 inhabitants (Toulouse). Measurements were made of vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG), total dissolved phosphor-us (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) in water and of three extractable forms of phosphorus (water extractable, NaOH extractable and H2SO4 extractable) in hyporheic sediments from the gravel bars. Dissolved phosphorus was the major contributor to TP (74-79%) in both interstitial and surface waters on all sampling dates, and in most cases surface water P concentrations were significantly higher than interstitial concentrations. Hyporheic sediment TP concentrations ranged between 269 and 465 mu g g(-1) and were highest in fine sediment fractions. Acid-extractable P, a non-bioavailable form, represented at least 95% of sediment TP. A positive relationship was observed between VHG and TP in two of the gravel bars, with wells that were strongly downwelling having lower TP concentrations. These results suggest that in downwelling zones, hyporheic sediments can trap surface-derived dissolved P, and that much of this P becomes stored in refractory particulate forms. Bioavailable P is mainly present in dissolved form and only occupies a small fraction of total P, with particulate P comprising the majority of total P. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Accounting for the impact of riparian plant communities on water balances is usually ignored due to the lack of data and information on water use of these plant communities. This is especially important for areas with limited water resources and in areas where water resources are shared between different users (agriculture, riparian zones, other ecosystems/agro-ecosystems, municipalities, recreational, mining, agro-ecology, etc.). Modelling stomatal resistance (r(L)) of riparian vegetation species is a complex process, but is also one of the limited processes to estimate evaporative losses for these plant communities for more inclusive, complete and robust water balance and hydrologic analyses for forecasting, planning, allocating and managing surface and groundwater resources and for hydrologic modelling. The objectives of this research were to (i) modify Jarvis-type model for estimating r(L) for three riparian plant species [Common reed (Phragmites australis), Peach-leaf willow (Salix amygdaloides) and Cottonwood (Populus sect. Aigeiros)], (ii) investigate the r(L) response to microclimate/environmental variables, and (iii) evaluate the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) versus r(L) response curves for estimating hourly r(L). A Jarvis-type model was modified by re-parametrization using porometer-measured data collected via extensive field campaigns in 2009 and 2010. Flooding in 2010 impacted the phenology and physiology of all species with increased r(L) and impedance in growth due to oxygen stress. While R-2 values were generally low for both years for all species, the response of r(L) to the same climate variables under the same environmental conditions exhibited substantial variations between the species. Overall, the response of r(L) to climatic variables was species-specific, complex and varied with surface and atmospheric conditions. For all species, stronger relationships between r(L) versus air temperature and net shortwave radiation were observed. The Jarvis-type model underestimated r(L) for all species and hence required independent re-parameterization for each specie independently. The model performance after re-parameterization improved substantially during both calibration and validation. Validation of the new modified Jarvis-type model (NMJ-model) resulted in good estimates of r(L) with root-mean-squared difference (RMSD) and R-2 values of 31 s m(-1) and 0.51 for Common reed; 56 s m(-1) and 0.81 for Peach-leaf willow; and 237 s m(-1) and 0.51 for Cottonwood, respectively. Strong agreements were found between measured and re-parameterized NMJ-model-estimated r(L) values for all three species in both years, but the relationships improved significantly in 2009 with no flooding. The NMJ-model-estimated r(L) values were within 10, 7 and 11% of the measured values for Common reed, Peach-leaf willow and Cottonwood, respectively. r(L) values estimated using PPFD versus r(L) response curves developed for individual species were used to estimate hourly r(L) and the response curves were able to effectively track the trends and magnitudes of r(L).
   With re-parameterization, the NMJ-models developed and tested for each riparian vegetation specie provide robust estimates of r(L) that can be used to quantify evaporative losses of these riparian plant communities for more complete local and regional water balance analyses by accounting for riparian vegetation water use.

AB The study on whether there is a magma chamber under Wudalianchi is a hot topic recently, as it holds great significances for the theory of plate tectonics, early warning of volcano eruption and geothermal exploration. There is no near surface geothermal abnormality reported in Weishan, the widely used and well-studied tool, geochemistry of geothermal fluids and geothermal gases, cannot be applied to this area. To reveal the thermal conditions under Weishan, we conducted a study about the abundances and isotope ratios of dissolved noble gases in shallow groundwater and springs of Weishan. The concentrations of noble gases display obvious Ne excesses and mass-dependent differentiation, the isotopic ratios indicate that Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe are atmosphere -derived noble gases (ANGs). We apply the closed-system equilibrium (CE) model to process the data of noble gases, and indicate that the excess ANGs are not caused by the increased hydrostatic pressure or diffusive influx. Neither meltwater mixing nor oxygen consumption alone could generate sufficient noble gas excesses in our samples. Based on the reconstructed abundances of noble gases in vapor phases produced at different boiling temperatures, which are calculated according to the boiling model established on Henry's law, we conclude that the abundances of noble gases in these samples were influenced by vapor-liquid partition caused by underground boiling. The diagrams of Kr-84/Ar-36, Ne-20/Ar-36 and Xe-130/Ar-36 confine the temperature range where the boiling events occur in similar to 100 degrees C-300 degrees C. We argued that the excess ANGs in shallow groundwater are geochemical evidence of boiling events, which seems to be continuously happening during the time range confined by the young groundwater in basalt aquifer and old groundwater in sandstone aquifer. Our findings also corroborate the recent results of geophysical survey works that a potential magma chamber exists under Weishan area. We suggest that noble gases dissolved in shallow aquifers represent a reliable geochemical tool to unveil subsurface geothermal state, where no near-surface thermal anomaly occurs.

AB Soils are naturally present in the form of stratified layers, each being distinguishable from adjacent layers by a distinctive set of hydraulic and elasticity properties. Lo et al. (2020) have recently presented a theoretical model of poroelasticity that provides a detailed description of simultaneous solid framework deformation and immiscible fluid flow in a two-layer soil system that is made up of upper unsaturated and lower saturated zones caused by a vertical constant surface load under semi-permeable boundary drainage conditions. Due to the existence of different moisture contents (partial and full saturations) in the upper and lower layers, excess pore fluid pressure does not exhibit a symmetric distribution with respect to depth. Therefore, an exact, analytical solution for fully permeable boundary drainage conditions cannot be determined readily by applying scaling transformations and spatial translations from our recent result even though the coupled model equations possess an invariance feature.
   In this paper, a well-defined boundary-value problem based on the decoupled model equations of poroelasticity generalized for a two-fluid system is rigorously formulated for a double-layer (unsaturated-saturated) soil profile that allows water drainage at both top and bottom surfaces. Using Laplace time transformation, we derive the closed-form, exact-analytical solution accounting for the intricate interaction between deformable solid matrix and compressible interstitial fluids in such a two-layer system. The solution takes a more complicated form than that for the semi-permeable case. Boundary drainage conditions indeed affect the development of excess pore water and air pressures along with the time evolution of total settlement. We show that when the bottom boundary of the saturated layer overlain by the unsaturated layer with a lower hydraulic conductivity is impervious, the curve describing the relationship between the depth and excess water pressure at the interface has a negative slope, whereas the slope is positive when the boundary is pervious. The total settlement in the lower saturated layer would thus achieve an equilibrium state faster.

AB In areas with very mild relief, water drains in a disordered way due to the lack of a developed drainage network, as it occurs in extremely flat sedimentary regions like the Argentine Pampas. The study analysed the flood spatial arrangements in 2014 by calculating landscape metrics and relating them to soil water balance. The study area is located at Del Azul creek lower basin (Pampa Ecoregion, Argentina). Daily soil water balances were obtained, and seven landscape metrics were calculated in 15 windows in five LandSat images, all along 2014, to explore the relationship between hydrological scenarios and spatial pattern summarized with principal component analysis. Water excess concentrated in winter (June and August); deficits were in late spring and summer (January and November), whereas the beginning of autumn (March) was an intermediate situation. Principal component 1 (44.7%) reflected area and shape metrics and correlated positively with water table level; principal component 2 (32.3%) summarized aggregation ones and was negatively associated with accumulated water excesses or deficits in previous 30 days and useful reserve. Both exhibited possible threshold-driven behaviour. Internal heterogeneity between NW and SE zones within the study area coincided with the existence of ancient alluvial fans. The results highlight the peculiarities of the flood spatial patterns in regions with very mild relief, where landforms usually determine water flows.

AB The processes that occur in wetlands and natural lakes are often overlooked and not fully incorporated in the conceptual development of many hydrological models of basin runoff. These processes can exert a considerable influence on downstream flow regimes and are critical in understanding the general patterns of runoff generation at the basin scale. This is certainly the case for many river basins of southern Africa which contain large wetlands and natural lakes and for which downstream flow regimes are altered through attenuation, storage and slow release processes that occur within the water bodies. Initial hydrological modelling studies conducted in some of these areas identified the need to explicitly account for wetland storage processes in the conceptual development of models. This study presents an attempt to incorporate wetland processes into an existing hydrological model, with the aim of reducing model structural uncertainties and improving model simulations where the impacts of wetlands or natural lakes on stream flow are evident. The approach is based on relatively flexible functions that account for the input-storage-output relationships between the river channel and the wetland. The simulation results suggest that incorporating lake and wetland storage processes into modelling can provide improved representation (the right results for the right reason) of the hydrological behaviour of some large river basins, as well as reducing some of the uncertainties in the quantification of the original model parameters used for generating the basin runoff.

AB We examined the isotope hydrology of eight, contrasting mesoscale (104-488km(2)) catchments characterized by a systematic change in the relative importance of upland and lowland areas that reflects the relative distribution of metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Precipitation and stream water were monitored over a 12-month period, and stable isotopes were used to examine spatial variations in the hydrometric and tracer dynamics of the catchments. Isotopic tracers were used to examine the temporal dynamics of different runoff sources, and geochemical tracers (alkalinity) were used to identify the geographic sources of runoff. Input-output relationships of isotopic tracers were explored using a gamma function to fit a transit time distribution, which was used to test the hypothesis that the length of mean transit times increased systematically with the cover of sandstone aquifers in the catchments. However, in three catchments, the increased influence of anthropogenic factors, notably reservoir storage, urban runoff and agricultural abstraction for irrigation, prevented reliable transit time estimation. For sites where tentative mean transit time estimates were possible, these varied from around 1.6years in upland catchments dominated by metamorphic rocks (>75%) and responsive soils to around 4years in catchments with 34% sandstone cover and freely draining soils. These preliminary results were consistent with inferences of geochemical tracers on the increased role of sedimentary aquifers as runoff sources in lowland areas, but observation from a larger number of sites is needed to confirm this.

AB Nutrients loading reduction in watershed is essential for lake restoration from eutrophication. The efficient and optimal decision-making on loading reduction is generally based on water quality modeling and the quantitative identification of nutrient sources at the watershed scale. The modeling process is influenced inevitably by inherent uncertainties, especially by uncertain parameters due to equifinality. Therefore, the emerging question is: if there is parameter uncertainty, how to ensure the robustness of the optimal decisions? Based on simulation-optimization models, an integrated approach of pattern identification and analysis of robustness was proposed in this study that focuses on the impact of parameter uncertainty in water quality modeling. Here the pattern represents the discernable regularity of solutions for load reduction under multiple parameter sets. Pattern identification is achieved by using a hybrid clustering analysis (i.e., Ward-Hierarchical and K-means), which was flexible and efficient in analyzing Lake Bali near the Yangtze River in China. The results demonstrated that urban domestic nutrient load is the most potential source that should be reduced, and there are two patterns for Total Nitrogen (TN) reduction and three patterns for Total Phosphorus (TP) reduction. The patterns indicated different total reduction of nutrient loads, which reflect diverse decision preferences. The robust solution was identified by the highest accomplishment with the water quality at monitoring stations that were improved uniformly with this solution. We conducted a process analysis of robust decision-making that was based on pattern identification and uncertainty, which provides effective support for decision making with preference under uncertainty.

AB Despite the apparent simplicity, it is notoriously difficult to measure rainfall accurately because of the challenging environment within which it is measured. Systematic bias caused by wind is inherent in rainfall measurement and introduces an inconvenient unknown into hydrological science that is generally ignored. This paper examines the role of rain gauge shape and mounting height on catch efficiency (CE), where CE is defined as the ratio between nonreference and reference rainfall measurements. Using a pit gauge as a reference, we have demonstrated that rainfall measurements from an exposed upland site, recorded by an adjacent conventional cylinder rain gauge mounted at 0.5 m, were underestimated by more than 23% on average. At an exposed lowland site, with lower wind speeds on average, the equivalent mean undercatch was 9.4% for an equivalent gauge pairing. An improved-aerodynamic gauge shape enhanced CE when compared to a conventional cylinder gauge shape. For an improved-aerodynamic gauge mounted at 0.5 m above the ground, the mean undercatch was 11.2% at the upland site and 3.4% at the lowland site. The mounting height of a rain gauge above the ground also affected CE due to the vertical wind gradient near to the ground. Identical rain gauges mounted at 0.5 and 1.5 m were compared at an upland site, resulting in a mean undercatch of 11.2% and 17.5%, respectively. By selecting three large rainfall events and splitting them into shorter-duration intervals, a relationship explaining 81% of the variance was established between CE and wind speed.
   Plain Language Summary This study was motivated by how challenging it is to measure rainfall accurately, despite it appearing to be very simple. Rainfall measurement is important to society because it has so many everyday uses, such as food production and weather forecasting, and applications that are critical to life, such as flood warning and effective management of water resources. Rainfall is difficult to measure because it varies so much in time and space, and the measurement of rain is highly affected by how windy it is, which also varies in time and space. Therefore, when it rains at the same time as being very windy, which is common during many storms, rainfall measurements are greatly underestimated. The uplands generally receive more rainfall and higher wind speeds than the lowlands, therefore it follows that we underestimate rainfall by more in the uplands. This is important because rainfall measurements in the uplands are sparse, yet it is in such areas where many floods originate. This study shows that the underestimation of rainfall at a site in the windy Scottish uplands was more than 23% on average. It then suggests some techniques that can be implemented to improve the measurement of rainfall.

AB Hydrological studies across varied climatic and physiographic regions have observed small changes in the 'states of wetness'; based on average soil moisture, can lead to dramatic changes in the amount of water delivered to the stream channel. This non-linear behaviour of the storm response has been attributed to a critical switching in spatial organization of shallow soil moisture and hydrologic connectivity. However, much of the analysis of the role of soil moisture organization and connectivity has been performed in small rangeland catchments. Therefore, we examined the relationship between hydrologic connectivity and runoff response within a temperate forested watershed of moderate relief. We have undertaken spatial surveys of shallow soil moisture over a sequence of storms with varying antecedent moisture conditions. We analyse each survey for evidence of hydrologic connectivity and we monitor the storm response from the catchment outlet. Our results show evidence of a non-linear response in runoff generation over small changes in measures of antecedent moisture conditions; yet, unlike the previous studies of rangeland catchments, in this forested landscape we do not observe a significant change in geostatistical hydrologic connectivity with variations in antecedent moisture conditions. These results suggest that a priori spatial patterns in shallow soil moisture in forested terrains may not always be a good predictor of critical hydrologic connectivity that leads to threshold change in runoff generation, as has been the case in rangeland catchments.

AB Sets of flow events from four catchments were selected in order to study how dynamics in the conversion of effective rainfall into streamflow depends on the event size. The approach taken was to optimize parameters of a linear delay function and effective rainfall series concurrently from precipitation-streamflow data without imposing a functional form of the precipitation filter a priori. The delay function is an instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) having a mathematical form of the two-parameter gamma distribution. Results from two small research catchments (0-18 and 0.63 km(2)) with sub-daily data suggest a clear relationship between the event magnitude and response dynamics. The effect of the sampling frequency of data was addressed by gradually increasing aggregation interval of rainfall and flow data and repeating the optimization for each aggregated dataset. IUHs for different data aggregation intervals (for a single event) tended to be similar unless the aggregation changed the locations of data peaks. IUHs identified in larger catchments (58 and 1235 km2) also showed variability through events; however, no systematic event magnitude dependence, as was visible in the small research catchments, was detected. Finally, the dependency detected in the small catchments was exploited in a rainfall-runoff model, where the scale parameter of the gamma distribution was linearly related to the effective rainfall intensity. Prediction of peak flows improved when the event dependency was taken into account. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil moisture is an important variable in explaining hydrological processes at hillslope scale. The distribution of soil moisture along a hillslope is related to the spatial distribution of the soil properties, the topography, the soil depth, and the vegetation. In order to investigate the factors affecting soil moisture, various environmental data were collected from a humid forest hillslope in this study. Several factors (the wetness index; the contributing area; the local slope; the soil depth; the composition of sand, silt, and clay; the scaling parameter; the hydraulic conductivity; the tree diameter at breast height; and the total weighted basal area) were evaluated for their effect on soil moisture and its distribution over the hillslope at depths of 10, 30, and 60 cm. Both linear correlation analysis and empirical orthogonal function analysis indicated that the soil texture was a dominant factor in soil moisture distribution. The impact of soil hydraulic conductivity was important for all soil moisture ranges at a depth of 30 cm, but those at 10 and 60 cm were limited to very wet and dry conditions, respectively. The relationships of the various factors with the spatial variability of soil moisture indicated the existence of a threshold soil moisture that is related to the composition of the soil and the factors related to the distribution of water in the study area.

AB Under future climate scenarios, possible changes of drought patterns pose new challenges for water resources management. For quantifying and qualifying drought characteristics in the UK, the drought severity indices of six catchments are investigated and modelled by two stochastic methods: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and the generalized linear model (GLM) approach. From the ARIMA models, autocorrelation structures are first identified for the drought index series, and the unexplained variance of the series is used to establish empirical relationships between drought and climate variables. Based on the ARIMA results, mean sea level pressure and possibly the North Atlantic Oscillation index are found to be significant climate variables for seasonal drought forecasting. Using the GLM approach, occurrences and amounts of rainfall are simulated with conditioning on climate variables. From the GLM-simulated rainfall for the 1980s and 2080s, the probabilistic characteristics of the drought severity are derived and assessed. Results indicate that the drought pattern in the 2080s is less certain than for the 19611990 period, based on the Shannon entropy, but that droughts are expected to be more clustered and intermittent. The 10th and 50th quantiles of drought are likely higher in the 2080s scenarios, but there is no evidence showing the changes in the 90th quantile extreme droughts.

AB Many solutes, either naturally occurring or introduced, are surface active and sorb preferentially at the interfaces of subsurface systems. In multiphase systems, the sorption of surfactants affects the capillary pressure-saturation relationships, fundamental constitutive relationships in the modeling of multiphase flow. In this study, the impact of surfactant sorption on capillary pressure relationships for organic liquid-waters systems was demonstrated by qualitatively correlating measurements of sorption and zeta potential, with interfacial tension and contact angle and, in turn, quantitatively relating these measurements to changes in capillary pressure-saturation relationships for o-xylene-water-quartz systems containing a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The results show that the sorption of CTAB causes the naturally hydrophilic system to become hydrophobic, as evidenced by a change in the contact angle from about 10 degrees-15 degrees to 155 degrees or 180 degrees, depending on the pH. This change in hydrophilicity is reflected in the zeta potential of the system which goes from negative to positive as the aqueous phase CTAB concentration increases. The spontaneous imbibition capillary pressure-saturation relationship is more sensitive to the sorption of CTAB than the drainage relationship. To predict the observed changes in both capillary pressure-saturation relationships, a modified form of Leverett's function was used where roughness and curvature corrections were incorporated into the intrinsic contact angle to give an operational contact angle. A comparison of the measured and predicted capillary pressure-saturation relationships showed reasonable agreement.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important parameter in hydrologic processes and modelling. In agricultural watersheds with competing uses of fresh water including irrigated agriculture, estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETc) accurately is critical for improving irrigation system and basin water management. The use of remote sensing-based basal crop coefficients is becoming a common method for estimating crop evapotranspiration for multiple crops over large areas. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), based on reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands, are commonly used for this purpose. In this paper, we examine the effects of row crop orientation and soil background darkening due to shading and soil surface wetness on these two vegetation indices through modelling, coupled with a field experiment where canopy reflectance of a cotton crop at different solar zenith angles, was measured with a portable radiometer. The results show that the NDVI is significantly more affected than the SAVI by background shading and soil surface wetness, especially in north-south oriented rows at higher latitudes and could lead to a potential overestimation of crop evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand if used for basal crop coefficient estimation. Relationships between the analysed vegetation indices and canopy biophysical parameters such as crop height, fraction of cover and leaf area index also were developed for both indices.

AB The stochastic nature of bed load transport induces diffusion of sediment tracers, which is governed by the dynamics of their bulk behavior over time. By deploying both numerical simulations and flume experiments, the emergent particle diffusion regimes for both uniform and mixed tracer particles were studied and compared. For uniform particles, power-law-distributed resting times T-r produced super-, sub- or normal diffusion regimes for certain values of the tail exponent v. Based on the assumption that heterogeneity in particle size leads to a power-law distribution of Tr, a completely different diffusion regime emerges in mixtures compared with those obtained from uniform particles with the same value of the tail exponent v. Mixtures exhibited the same ballistic regime (the variance of travel distance grows as time squared) for different values of v, and ballistic regimes for mixtures also emerged from several other tested models. Furthermore, our experimental results confirmed the ballistic regime; however, the decreasing number of tracked particles may result in apparent but deceptive sub-diffusion. We conclude that ballistic regimes for mixtures result from violations of the independent and identically distributed (i. i.d.) assumptions, attributing to downstream sorting processes.

AB The accurate estimation of profile soil moisture is usually difficult due to the associated costs, strong spatiotemporal variability, and nonlinear relationship between surface and profile moisture. Here, we used data sets from the Soil and Climate Analysis Network to test how reliably observation operators developed based on the cumulative distribution function matching method can predict profile soil moisture from surface measurements. We first analysed how temporal resolution (hourly, daily, and weekly) and data length (half year, 1year, 2years, and 4years) affected the performance of observation operators. The results showed that temporal resolution had a negligible influence on the performance of observation operators. However, a leave-one-year-out cross-validation showed that data length affected the performance of observation operators; a 2-year interval was identified as the most suitable duration due to its low uncertainty in prediction accuracy. The robustness of the observation operators was then tested in three primary climates (humid continental, humid subtropical, and semiarid) of the continental United States, with the exponential filter employed as an independent method. The results indicated that observation operators reliably predicted profile soil moisture for most of the tested stations and performed almost equally well as the exponential filter method. The presented results verified the feasibility of using the cumulative distribution function matching method to predict profile soil moisture from surface measurements.

AB Long hydroclimate records are essential elements for the assessment and management of changing freshwater resources. These records are especially important in transboundary watersheds where international cooperation is required in the joint planning and management process of shared basins. Dendrochronological techniques were used to develop a multicentury record of April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) for the Stikine River basin in northern British Columbia, Canada, from moisture-sensitive white spruce (Picea glauca) tree rings. Explaining 43% of the instrumental SWE variability, to our knowledge, this research represents the first attempt to develop long-term snowpack reconstructions in northern British Columbia. The results indicated that 15 extreme low April 1 SWE events occurred from 1789 to the beginning of the instrumental record in 1974. The reconstruction record also shows that the occurrence of hydrological extremes in the Stikine River basin is characterized by persistent below-average periods in SWE consistent with phase shifts of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Spectral analyses indicate a very distinct in-phase (positive) relationship between the multidecadal frequencies of variability (similar to 40 years) extracted from the SWE tree-ring reconstruction and other reconstructed winter and spring PDO indices. Comparison of the reconstructed SWE record with other tree-ring-derived PDO proxy records shows coherence at multidecadal frequencies of variability. The research has significant implications for regional watershed management by highlighting the hydrological response of the Stikine River basin to prior climate changes.

AB The suspended sediment load in the middle Yellow River basin (YRB) cannot be well predicted by capacity-based transport formulas because a large fraction of suspended sediment load is composed of wash load. This study evaluated the spatial variations of sediment rating curves (SRCs) in the middle YRB. Both power and linear SRCs were used to fit daily flow and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) historical data at 49 gauging stations throughout the middle YRB. The spatial variation in regression coefficients was investigated, and the relationship between regression coefficients and the physical characteristics of watersheds was discussed. The results indicate that SRC regression coefficients vary with drainage area and basin slope, but their responses to these parameters are remarkably different in watersheds with different underlying surfaces, which indicates the significance of sediment availability, erodibility, and grain size distribution. For power SRCs representing sediment transport in unsaturated flows, the regression coefficients are more closely correlated with the drainage area in loess regions and with the basin slope in rock mountain regions. For linear SRCs representing sediment transport in saturated flows, saturated SSCs vary with coarse (particle size>0.05mm) and fine (particle size<0.01mm) fractions in suspended sediment. The maximum saturated SSC among the different gauging stations is associated with the optimal grain size composition of suspended sediment, which has been proposed for loess regions in previous studies. This study provides theoretical support for estimating the regression parameters for sediment transport modelling, especially in ungauged basins.

AB The upstream regions of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) have undergone significant changes in land use during recent years, and these changes have strongly influenced runoff generation downstream. In this study, the relationships between land use changes and corresponding hydrological responses in the Dong and Puli River basins in the upstream region of the TGR were quantified using the runoff coefficient. Empirical regression equations between the runoff coefficient and the percentage of land use types were developed for the study area using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to simulate the runoff generation processes in the two basins, and land use maps developed using Landsat Thematic Mapper images from 2000, 2005, and 2010 were compared to extract information on changes in land use. The results showed that the total area of forest and pasture decreased over the 10-year study period, while paddy fields and upland increased in both basins. These land use changes dramatically affected hydrological processes. Evapotranspiration decreased by 2.13% and 2.41% between 2000 and 2010 in the Dong and Puli River basins, respectively, whereas quickflow, infiltration, and baseflow increased to varying degrees. The PLSR modeling results showed that upland had a negative effect on the runoff coefficient and was the most influential land use type in the study area. In contrast, a positive effect of forest on runoff generation was found in most of the regression models. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Wetland and maize farmland are main ecosystems in Northeast China, which play important roles in water, heat and energy exchanges between land and atmosphere. In this study, We used the eddy covariance system to examine the characteristics of water, heat and energy exchanges over a rain-fed maize agricultural ecosystem and a reed wetland ecosystem. The results showed that water and heat exchanges had significant differences between the two ecosystems, which were attributed to obvious distinction in their surface properties. Heat exchange (H) was stronger over reed Wetland, while water vapour exchange (LE) was greater over maize farmland. Wetland has great thermal capacity that tends to slow down the energy exchange; therefore, half-hour peak values of LE and H over the wetland delayed for half ail hour compared to the maize farmland. The ratio of evapotranspiration (ET) to potential evapotranspiration (ETp) indicated that ET over the reed wetland was most of the time close to ETp in the non-growing season, while ET over the maize farmland was closer to ETp in the growing season. A weak linear relationship was found between ET and leaf area index (LAI) over the reed wetland in the growing season, indicating that the transpiration from canopy provided few contributions to ET. In addition, uncertain water resources brought external energy into reed wetland, resulting in poor energy Closure, which provided some uncertainty to the partition of available energy.

AB Evidence for a close relationship between the interannual variation of stable isotopes in precipitation and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is presented for Bangkok, Thailand. Anomalies of sea surface temperature in the Nino-3 region of the equatorial Pacific (ENSO index) and delta O-18 in precipitation in Bangkok were positively correlated for May and October. The composite mean precipitation was much greater in the isotopic low phase than in the high phase for both May and October. This suggests that the amount of precipitation is the main factor determining the observed variation of stable isotopes in precipitation in Bangkok. Composite analyses of 850 hPa temperature, evaporation, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and precipitation showed that the variation in the amount of precipitation in Bangkok is a response to the ENSO-Asian summer monsoon coupling in May, and a direct response to ENSO in October. The composite mean d-excess values in both the low and high phases in October and in the low phase in May were about 10%, and were less than 7% during the high phase in May. A large difference in the evaporation field between the low and high phases of May exists over the Indian Ocean, suggesting that evaporation was not in equilibrium during the high phase in May. Future studies will consider the precipitation amount effect based on daily or event-based sampling. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Despite a growing interest in the sediment dynamics of dryland rivers, most research has been based on ephemeral streams in endogenic hydrological systems (runoff and sediment transport determined by local precipitation). Less attention, however, has been paid to allogenic and perennial dryland rivers. Here, we report a case study on the suspended sediment dynamics of the Tarim River, an allogenic and perennial river flowing in a very arid environment in China, based on mean daily discharge and mean daily suspended sediment concentration (SSC) over the last 5 decades (1960-2011). Results reveal that discharge and SSCs are predominantly low and have distributions with large positive skewness. The SSC-discharge relationships can be fairly well generalized by power functions, with quite large scatter at extreme (low and high) flow conditions. Marked temporal and spatial variations were observed in the effective discharge for sediment transport. The frequency of the effective discharge ranged from 0.5% to 2% (or an average flow duration of 2-7 days/year), implying that moderate to high flows play an important role in sediment transport. The sediment rating curves show strong hysteresis effects, with 3 types of hysteresis loops observed, clockwise (the most predominant), anticlockwise, and figure of eight. The high potential for bank collapse near the peak and falling limb of the flood hydrograph is the major cause of anticlockwise and figure-of-eight hysteresis loops.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in catchment water budgets, typically accounting for more than 50% of annual precipitation falling within temperate deciduous forests. Groundwater ET is a portion of total ET that occurs where plant roots extend to the capillary fringe above the phreatic surface or induce upward movement of water from the water table by hydraulic redistribution. Groundwater ET is spatially restricted to riparian zones or other areas where the groundwater is accessible to plants. Due to the difficulty in measuring groundwater ET, it is rarely incorporated explicitly into hydrological models. In this study, we calibrated Topographic Model (TOPMODEL) using a 14-year hydrograph record and added a groundwater ET pathway to derive a new model, Groundwater Evapotranspiration TOPMODEL (GETTOP). We inspected groundwater elevations and stream flow hydrographs for evidence of groundwater ET, examined the relationship between groundwater ET and topography, and delineated the area where groundwater ET is likely to take place. The total groundwater ET flux was estimated using a hydrological model. Groundwater ET was larger where the topography was flat and the groundwater table was shallow, occurring within about 10% of the area in a headwater catchment and accounting for 6 to 18% of total annual ET. The addition of groundwater ET to GETTOP improved the simulation of stream discharge and more closely balanced the watershed water budget. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The paper presents the development of a lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model [Transformation of rainfall to runoff, Variability across timescales and Model parsimonization (TVM)] and a series of tests on various levels of model structure at different time resolutions. It is applied to the Bradford catchment in the United Kingdom. The TVM model is developed with a flexible structure through various relationships in each module that can be modified depending on the study catchments. Adopting the downward approach, parsimonious models are developed to examine at what level of complexity the model is able to capture runoff variability. The approach aims to compromise between parsimonious and complex alternatives in model development. This study shows that model structure requires data at different aggregation levels of timescales depending on its complexity. It reveals that the absence of the infiltration excess strongly affected all models. The analysis shows that the time resolution of hourly downwards must be used for the study catchment. The investigation of model complexity indicates that the combination of the most complicated model structure and timescale of quarter-hourly is adequate to capture the catchment runoff characteristics. The downward approach in the TVM model helps to gain a deeper understanding of water balance and runoff process in the study catchment. The approach could be applicable to other catchments to obtain parsimonious models. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID HABITAT
AB The River Piddle, a small chalk stream in Dorset, supports a valuable fishery for brown trout. It is also heavily utilised for water abstraction, with a licensed maximum daily quantity of 197 Ml/d, of which 43.5% can be taken from the groundwater. The largest licensed groundwater uses (by licensed volume) are public water supplies (PWS), of which there are four within the Piddle catchment.
   Investigations into the impacts of the largest PWS abstraction, at Briantspuddle, on the brown trout population and fisheries of the River Piddle demonstrated a spatial correlation between a zone of reduced river Bow and an area of low juvenile trout abundance, and a reduction in the period during which good quality trout fishing was available.
   Trout habitat was quantified by applying the Physical Habitat Simulation System (PHABSIM) in conjunction with a groundwater model. The resultant habitat duration curves and habitat time-series corresponding with historical and naturalised (zero abstraction) flow, indicated large habitat losses for juvenile trout.
   Using discharge habitat relationships a preferred flow regime for the river at Briantspuddle, designed to satisfy both ecological and recreational needs, was identified. This flow regime, which will be maintained by stream support, includes a 'survival flow' for juvenile trout during the critical summer low flow period. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Improved estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) are needed for water resource management and irrigation scheduling. We review the use of imaging spectroscopy to capture estimates of water vapour flux and biophysical components of ET. Remote sensing has long attempted to quantify and predict ET, with most applications relying only on green vegetation indexes from multispectral imagers combined with thermal radiance and weather data. In contrast, imaging spectrometry is an advanced remote sensing technology that measures hundreds of spectral bands in the solar spectrum. Plant pigments, water, and dry matter have unique spectral signatures that can advance estimates of ET and detection of drought stress. This allows analyses based on the physics of spectroscopy and avoids a requirement for continual empirical calibration. These spectral components provide unprecedented information about plant physiological processes, which improve understanding of the regulation of water fluxes and the energy budget. Laboratory, field, and airborne studies of spectral properties in the near- and shortwave-infrared region show strong relationships with plant water relations like water content, relative water content, and water potential. Because water absorption features are spectrally independent of pigment absorptions in the visible region, they provide a new source of information about environmental conditions. These new observations from imaging spectroscopy will lead to better understanding of ecological and hydrological processes. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The role of hummocky terrain in governing runoff routing and focussing groundwater recharge in the Northern Prairies of North America is widely recognised. However, most hydrological studies in the region have not effectively utilised information on the surficial geology and associated landforms in large-scale hydrological characterization. The present study uses an automated digital elevation model (DEM) analysis of a 6500-km(2) area in the Northern Prairies to quantify hydrologically relevant terrain parameters for the common types of terrains in the prairies with different surficial deposits widespread in the prairies, namely, moraines and glaciolacustrine deposits. Runoff retention (and storage) capacity within depressions varies greatly between different surficial deposits and is comparable in magnitude with a typical amount of seasonal snowmelt runoff generation. The terrain constraint on potential runoff retention varies from a few millimetres in areas classified as moraine to tens of millimetres in areas classified as stagnant ice moraine deposits. Fluted moraine and glaciolacustrine deposits have intermediate storage capacity values. The study also identified the probability density function describing a number of immediate upstream neighbours for each depression in a fill-and-spill network. A relationship between depression parameters and surficial deposits, as well as identified depression network structure, allows parametrisation of hydrologic models outside of the high-resolution DEM coverage, which can still account for terrain variation in the Prairies.

AB The identification of sediment sources is fundamental to the management of increasingly scarce water resources. Tracing the origin of sediment with elemental geochemistry is a well-established approach to determining sediment provenance. Fundamental to the confident apportionment of sediment to their lithogenic sources is the modelling process. Recent approaches have incorporated distributions throughout the modelling process including source contribution terms for two end-member sources. The shift from modelling source samples to modelling samples drawn from distributions has removed relationships, including potential correlations between elemental concentrations, from the modelling process. Here, we present a novel modelling approach that re-incorporates correlations between elemental concentrations and models distributions for source contribution terms for multiple source end members. Artificial mixtures, based on catchment sources samples, were created to test the accuracy of this correlated distribution model and also examine modelling approaches used in the literature. The most accurate model incorporates correlations between elements, uses the absolute mixing model difference and does not use any weighting. This model was then applied to identify the sources of sediment in three South East Queensland catchments and demonstrated that Quaternary Alluvium is the most dominant source of sediment in these catchments ( 44%, sigma 12%). This study demonstrates that it is important to understand how different weightings may impact modelling results. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The Soil Conservation Service curve number (CN) method is widely used for predicting direct runoff from rainfall. However, despite the extent of cultivation on hillslope areas, very few attempts have been made to incorporate a slope factor into the CN method. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate existing approaches integrating slope in the CN method, and (2) to develop an equation incorporating a slope factor into the CN method for application in the steep slope areas of the Loess Plateau of China. The dataset consisted of 11 years of rainfall and runoff measurements from two experimental sites with slopes ranging from 14 to 140%. The results indicated that the standard CN method underestimated large runoff events and overestimated small events. For our experimental conditions, the optimized and non-optimized forms of the slope-modified CN method of the Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator model improved runoff prediction for steep slopes, but large runoff events were still underestimated and small ones overpredicted. Based on relationships between slope and the observed and theoretical CN values, an equation was developed that better predicted runoff depths with an R-2 of 0(.)822 and a linear regression slope of 0(.)807. This slope-adjusted CN equation appears to be the most appropriate for runoff prediction in the steep areas of the Loess Plateau of China. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In deeply weathered laterite catchments of the Darling Range in south-western Australia, the direct contribution (i.e., discharge) of permanent groundwater to streamflow has long been considered as minor. Instead, downslope shallow throughflow was thought to dominate, generating more than 90% of streamflow. We used a chemical hydrograph separation approach to estimate annual groundwater discharge for three catchments over periods of up to 39 years, and found that direct groundwater contributions to streamflow were far more variable across catchments and through time than has previously been acknowledged. The estimated proportion of annual streamflow sourced directly from groundwater ranged from 0 to 93% and was related linearly to the size of the groundwater discharge area in the catchment valley floor. In contrast, contributions from shallow sources including shallow throughflow varied primarily and linearly with annual rainfall. However, the response to rainfall was "amplified" in a predictable way by the size of the groundwater discharge area, consistent with the variable source area concept. We derived a functional relationship between catchment annual rainfall-runoff ratio and groundwater discharge area and successfully applied this to a further four catchments, inferring that the results were broadly applicable across the Darling Range. The implications for an improved understanding of streamflow generating processes in the study region, and for laterite catchments generally, are discussed.

AB Geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) are commonly reported as having hardpan or low hydraulic conductivity units underneath that produce perched groundwater, which can sustain surface water levels independently of regional aquifer fluctuations. Despite the potential of GIW-perched aquifer systems to provide important hydrological and ecological functions such as groundwater storage and native amphibian habitat, little research has studied the hydrologic controls and dynamics of these systems. We compared several ridge-top depressional GIW-perched groundwater systems to investigate the role of watershed morphology on hydroregime and groundwater-surface water interaction. Ridge-top depressional wetlands in the Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky were chosen because they offer natural controls such as lack of apparent connection to surface water bodies, similar climate, and similar soils. Three wetlands with different topographic slopes and hillslope structures were mapped to distinguish key geomorphic parameters and monitored to characterize groundwater-surface water interaction. Wetlands with soil hummocks and low upland slopes transitioned from infiltration to groundwater discharge conditions in the spring and during storm events. The magnitude and duration of this transition fell along a continuum, where higher topographic slopes and steeper uplands produced comparably smaller and shorter head reversals. This demonstrates that ridge-top GIW-perched groundwater systems are largely sensitive to the runoff-recharge relationship in the upland area which can produce significant groundwater storage on a small-scale.

AB The Xinanjiang model, which is a conceptual rainfall-runoff model and has been successfully and widely applied in humid and semi-humid regions in China, is coupled by the physically based kinematic wave method based on a digital drainage network. The kinematic wave Xinanjiang model (KWXAJ) uses topography and land use data to Simulate runoff and overland flow routing. For the modelling, the catchment is Subdivided into numerous hillslopes and consists of a raster grid of flow vectors that define the water flow directions. The Xinanjiang model simulates the runoff yield in each grid cell, and the kinematic wave approach is then applied to a ranked raster network. The grid-based rainfall-runoff model was applied to simulate basin-scale water discharge from an 805-km(2) catchment of the Huaihe River, China. Rainfall and discharge records were available for the years 1984, 1985, 1987, 1998 and 1999. Eight flood events were used to calibrate the model's parameters and three other flood events were used to validate the grid-based rainfall-runoff model. A Manning's roughness via a linear flood depth relationship was Suggested in this paper for improving flood forecasting. The calibration and validation results show that this model works well. A sensitivity analysis was further performed to evaluate the variation of topography (hillslopes) and land use parameters on catchment discharge. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) was measured via the eddy covariance technique at a shrub bog peatland in southeastern Ontario for 5 years. For most of the study period the temperature was above normal. Precipitation was variable, but, in 2 years, late summer dry periods resulted in an extended period of deep drawdown of the water table (WT). Growing-season (May-September) daily ET varied considerably; maximum ET rates were 4 to 5 rum day(-1). Winter ET rates were an order of magnitude smaller than in summer, yet the total winter ET loss was important, accounting for 23 to 30% of the annual ET water loss. Annual precipitation exceeded annual ET by 1.55 to 1.94 times.
   During the growing season, daily ET was closely related to daily potential evaporation (PET); however, the slope of this relationship was statistically different in some years. In contrast, ET and WT were only weakly related in most years. When ET was sorted into 5 cm WT classes there was no difference in mean ET across most WT classes; only the two deepest WT classes had significantly smaller mean ET. The ratio ET/PET followed the same pattern. We present a conceptual model of ET that relates WT, soil hydraulic properties and moss and vascular plant processes.

AB Effects of the catchment runoff coefficient on the performance of TOPMODEL in simulating catchment rainfall-runoff relationships are investigated in this paper, with an aim to improve TOPMODEL's simulation efficiency in catchments with a low runoff coefficient. Application of TOPMODEL in the semi-arid Yihe catchment, with an area of 2623 km(2) in the Yellow River basin of China, produced a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency of about 80%. To investigate how the catchment runoff coefficient affects the performance of TOPMODEL, the whole observed discharge series of the Yihe catchment is multiplied with a larger-than-unity scale factor to obtain an amplified discharge series. Then TOPMODEL is used to simulate the amplified discharge series given the original rainfall and evaporation data. For a set of different scale factors, TOPMODEL efficiency is plotted against the corresponding catchment runoff coefficient and it is found that the efficiency of TOPMODEL increases with the increasing catchment runoff coefficient before reaching a peak (e.g. about 90%); after the peak, however, the efficiency of TOPMODEL decreases with the increasing catchment runoff coefficient. Based on this finding, an approach called the discharge amplification method is proposed to enhance the simulation efficiency of TOPMODEL in rainfall-runoff modelling in catchments with a low runoff coefficient.

AB A lumped water balance model was used to derive a monthly water storage series in the Salado-Juramento southern basin, for the period 1954-1986. The evapotranspiration term was estimated using the Bouchet's complementary relationship. Different evapotranspiration formulas following the concepts of potential evapotranspiration and wet environmental evapotranspiration were used. The regional average groundwater levels and the specific yield were used to tune Bouchet's equation. The extrapolation of the water storage series to a secular period (1901-2002) was achieved using a synthetic annual discharge series. The water storage was deficient for most of the century, i.e. more than 60years; nevertheless in the last 30years, the system recovers half of the water previously lost. The singular spectral analysis showed that a significant low-frequency signal is present in the water storage and precipitation series. The main cause of water storage variability would be given by precipitation, in spite of the vast anthropogenic changes on the basin. Anthropogenic effects would be reflected in the river discharges, where no significant signal is detected before 1970; however, an annual signal is insinuated after that year. The conclusions of this work could be different if we only looked at the 1954-1986 period. The results of that period suggest that the basin is primarily accumulating water instead of being mainly in deficit. Thus, here we demonstrated the importance of the secular analysis to illustrate the complete basin behaviour. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

LA English
DT Article
DE advective porosity; tensor; directional porous media; fractured rocks
ID FRACTURE; MEDIA; FLOW
AB Field tracer tests indicate that advective porosity, the quantity relating advective velocity to Darcy flux. may, exhibit directional dependence. Hydraulic anisotropy explains some but not all of the reported directional results. The present paper shows mathematically that directional variations in advective porosity may arise simply from incomplete mixing of an inert tracer between directional flow channels within a sampling (or support) volume omega of soil or rock that may be hydraulically isotropic or anisotropic. In the traditional fully homogenized case, our theory yields trivially a scalar advective porosity equal to the interconnected porosity phi, thus explaining neither the observed directional effects nor the widely reported experimental finding that advective porosity is generally smaller than phi. We consider incomplete mixing under conditions in which the characteristic time t(D) of longitudinal diffusion along channels across omega is much shorter than the characteristic time t(H) required for homogenization through transverse diffusion between channels. This may happen where flow takes place preferentially through relatively conductive channels and/for fractures of variable orientation separated by material that forms a partial barrier to diffusive transport. Our solution is valid for arbitrary channel Peclet numbers on a correspondingly wide range of time scales t(D) less than or equal to t much less than t(H). It shows that the tracer center of mass is advected at a macroscopic velocity which is generally not collinear with the macroscopic Darcy flux and exceeds it in magnitude. These two vectors are related through a second-rank symmetric advective dispersivity tensor Phi. If the permeability k of omega is a symmetric positive-definite tensor, so is Phi. However, the principal directions and values of these two tensors are generally not the same; whereas those of k are a fixed property of the medium and the length-scale of omega, those of Phi depend additionally on the direction an magnitude of the applied hydraulic gradient. When the latter is large, diffusion has negligible effect on Phi and once may consider tracer mass to be distributed between channels in proportion to the magnitude of their Darcy flux. This is made intuitive through a simple example of an idealized fracture network. Our analytical formalism reveals the properties of Phi but is too schematic to allow predicting the latter accurately on the basis of realistic details about the void structure of omega and tracer mass distribution within it. Yet knowing the tensorial properties of Phi is sufficient to allow determining it indirectly on the basis of omega-scale hydraulic and tracer data, including concentrations that represent homogenized samples extracted from (or sensed externally across) an omega-scale plume.

AB Soil moisture plays a pivotal role in terrestrial water circulation, energy transfer, and mass exchange. The X-band radiometer on-board Fengyun-3B and -3C satellites have been used for soil moisture retrieval since 2011. In this study, the spatial and temporal integrity of all available Fengyun-3 series soil moisture products were evaluated, and the data accuracy was validated against four in-situ measurements ascertained globally. The validation results reveal that: (1) The ascending Fengyun-3B soil moisture retrievals express higher spatial coverage percentages than others, and a higher temporal coverage percentage appears at 20-60 degrees N and 20-50 degrees S in summer. (2) The soil moisture products derived from both Fengyun-3B and -3C satellites reveal superior goodness of fit and smaller bias in the northern hemisphere in-situ measurements than in the southern hemisphere. In particular, the satellite retrieved pixel scale soil moisture datasets possesses a better correlation to small scale networks with densely distributed stations. In the southern hemisphere, the bias was positively correlated with the vegetation index and negatively correlated to land surface temperature, and this regularity may act as a reference for Fengyun-3 soil moisture correction. Moreover, the Fengyun-3 soil moisture products reveal positive responses to precipitation, and the memory of soil moisture to precipitation could last for at least 5 days. (3) The X-band signals were gradually impacted by increasing vegetation optical depth, leading to obvious overestimations. Further corrections, including hardware and software, are urgently required to enhance the anti-interference and robustness of the X-band signal.

DT Article
AB The concept of the dimensionless cumulant coefficient (gamma,), developed in the companion paper (Strupczewski & Dooge, 1995), is used to demonstrate that a linear interpolation between the two limiting cases of the Froude number F-o O and F-o 1 provides a good approximation to the higher cumulants of the channel response in the intermediate range of O < F-o < 1. It is shown that the moments of any order R, either about the origin or about the centre follow the same linear interpolation rule as that applied to the impulse responses of the limiting cases. The first three cumulants are consequently the same in model and prototype. The fourth cumulants are made equal through the weighting factor of the linear interpolation. A study of the higher cumulants for R > 4 shows that the same basic linear interpolation holds for R = 5, R = 6, and R = 7 but not for values of R greater than or equal to 8. The analysis of the errors involved for R greater than or equal to 5 shows that there is zero error for R = 5 and a small relative error in the middle of the range for R > 5. For R = 5, R = 6 and R = 7, the error function is independent of the length of the channel as well as of the Froude number and the channel shape parameter (m).

AB To investigate the influences of land surface temperatures (LSTs) on suprapermafrost groundwater discharge, a river valley was selected in a typical permafrost region of Fenghuoshan (FHS) watershed on the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We developed a two-dimensional model to simulate the suprapermafrost groundwater seasonal dynamics controlled by LSTs and the changing trends under a warming climate scenario (3 degrees C/100 year). We calibrated key parameters of our model by the field observations at FHS watershed and analysed the relationship between the different LSTs and the suprapermafrost groundwater discharge dynamics in the active layer. The results show that (a) by changing the permeability of the active layer, the LSTs have a significant effect on the suprapermafrost groundwater discharge. A higher LST causes more suprapermafrost groundwater discharge, resulting in a different discharge pattern and affecting the ability to replenish the nearby river in the permafrost area. (b) Under a warming climate, the most obvious change in the suprapermafrost groundwater occurs in the freeze initiation period (from October to December), and there is a significant increase in the suprapermafrost groundwater discharge rate. This study reveals that the LST has a controlling effect on the seasonal dynamics of shallow groundwater systems in permafrost regions, indicating that the impact of local topography on the suprapermafrost groundwater should not be ignored in suprapermafrost groundwater simulations. Moreover, the warming simulation results demonstrate that the freezing season is the significant transformation period of suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics under future climate change, which can be used to better understand hydrological and ecological process changes in permafrost regions under climate warming.

AB Physiography and land cover determine the hydrologic response of watersheds to climatic events. However, vast differences in climate regimes and variation of landscape attributes among watersheds (including size) have prevented the establishment of general relationships between land cover and runoff patterns across broad scales. This paper addresses these difficulties by using power spectral analysis to characterize area-normalized runoff patterns and then compare these patterns with landscape features among watersheds within the same physiographic region. We assembled long-term precipitation and runoff data for 87 watersheds (first to seventh order) within the eastern Piedmont (USA) that contained a wide variety of land cover types, collected environmental data for each watershed, and compared the datasets using a variety of statistical measures. The effect of land cover on runoff patterns was confirmed. Urban-dominated watersheds were flashier and had less hydrologic memory compared with forest-dominated watersheds, whereas watersheds with high wetland coverage had greater hydrologic memory. We also detected a 10-15% urban threshold above which urban coverage became the dominant control on runoff patterns. When spectral properties of runoff were compared across stream orders, a threshold after the third order was detected at which watershed processes became dominant over precipitation regime in determining runoff patterns. Finally, we present a matrix that characterizes the hydrologic signatures of rivers based on precipitation versus landscape effects and low-frequency versus high-frequency events. The concepts and methods presented can be generally applied to all river systems to characterize multiscale patterns of watershed runoff. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study is focused on the analysis of the relationship between sap-flow-derived transpiration measured in a Scots pine stand in the Vallcebre research catchments (NE Iberian Peninsula) and meteorological and rainfall data. The first part of the study is focused on the analysis of temperature and rainfall anomalies. Then, the Scots pine transpiration response to inter-annual rainfall variability, soil water stress and water table depth variations during the period 1997-2000 is analysed. This period includes the extremely dry year of 1998, which allows us to infer the response of Scots pine transpiration to severe droughts. Scots pine transpiration during the summer presented a high inter-annual variability, largely related to rainfall amounts. Daily transpiration during dry summers was 40% of the transpiration of a summer day with average rainfall. Moreover, during dry summers, transpiration rates were not fully recovered even after significant rainfall events. The analysis of the dependence of Scots pine transpiration on available water indicated the strong limitation on transpiration induced by water content in the whole soil profile as well as by water table position. Under these drought conditions, a reduction of runoff and deep water stores was observed at the catchment scale, suggesting that the predicted increase in the frequency of severe summer droughts may threaten the current role of Mediterranean mountain catchments as suppliers of water resources for lowland areas.

AB The method used for feature selection or feature weighting in regionalization of watersheds may affect the results of regionalization methods considerably. It can play a key role in forming hydrologically homogeneous regions for regional flood frequency analysis. In this study, a method based on exploring the nearest and farthest neighbours of data points is introduced for identifying salient features for regionalization of watersheds. The method includes options to relate watershed features to flood data records in order to increase the homogeneity of the regions. The nearest and farthest neighbours are identified based on the criteria such as the mutual information criterion and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Then, the watershed features more able to explain the relationships between the nearest and farthest neighbours are identified as salient features to form homogeneous features for regional flood frequency analysis. The results show that the optimum option of the proposed method improves the performances of the hard and fuzzy clustering algorithms in more than half of the cases based on the cluster validity indices. Furthermore, the results reveal that the optimum option can increase the number of the homogeneous regions formed by clustering algorithms to a great extent. By using the optimum option with 5 nearest and 5 farthest neighbours, longitude, drainage area, and run-off coefficient are identified as the salient features to regionalize Sefidrud basin. The results show that the proposed method can be considered as an efficient method to form homogeneous regions for regional flood frequency analysis.

AB This study presents time-varying suspended sediment-discharge rating curves to model suspended-sediment concentrations (SSCs) under alternative climate scenarios. The proposed models account for hysteresis at multiple time scales, with particular attention given to systematic shifts in sediment transport following large floods (long-term hysteresis). A series of nested formulations are tested to evaluate the elements embedded in the proposed models in a case study watershed that supplies drinking water to New York City. To maximize available data for model development, a dynamic regression model is used to estimate SSC based on denser records of turbidity, where the parameters of this regression are allowed to vary over time to account for potential changes in the turbidity-SSC relationship. After validating the proposed rating curves, we compare simulations of SSC among a subset of models in a climate change impact assessment using an ensemble of flow simulations generated using a stochastic weather generator and hydrologic model. We also examine SSC estimates under synthetic floods generated using a peaks-over-threshold model. Our results indicate that estimates of extreme SSC under new climate and hydrologic scenarios can vary widely depending on the selected model and may be significantly underestimated if long-term hysteresis is ignored when simulating impacts under sequences of large storm event. Based on the climate change scenarios explored here, average annual maximum SSC could increase by as much as 2.45 times over historical values.

AB Bacterial concentration (Escherichia coli) is used as the key indicator for marine beach water quality in Hong Kong. For beaches receiving streamflow from unsewered catchments, water quality is mainly affected by local nonpoint source pollution and is highly dependent on the bacterial load contributed from the catchment. As most of these catchments are ungauged, the bacterial load is generally unknown. In this study, streamflow and the associated bacterial load contributed from an unsewered catchment to a marine beach, Big Wave Bay, are simulated using a modelling approach. The physically based distributed hydrological model, MIKE-SHE, and the empirical watershed water quality model (Hydrological Simulation Program - Fortran) are used to simulate streamflow and daily-averaged E. coli concentration/load, respectively. The total daily derived loads predicted by the model during calibration (June-July 2007) and validation (July-October 2008) periods agree well with empirical validation data, with a percentage difference of 3 and 2%, respectively. The simulation results show a nonlinear relationship between E. coli load and rainfall/streamflow and reveal a source limiting nature of nonpoint source pollution. The derived load is further used as an independent variable in a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to predict daily beach water quality. When compared with the MLR models based solely on hydrometeorological input variables (e.g. rainfall and salinity), the new model based on bacterial load predicts much more realistic E. coli concentrations during rainstorms.

AB Numerous aquitard drainage models for dewatering-induced land subsidence have been proposed in the past. Most of them are based on one or more of the following assumptions, including the validity of Darcy's law, neglect of rheological nature and constant soil properties. However, these assumptions may fail to reflect actual characteristics of viscoelastic aquitards. For this reason, the present study improves Terzaghi's one-dimensional (1-D) consolidation model by incorporating the exponential non-Darcian law, the Merchant viscoelastic model and the nonlinear correlations between soil compressibility, hydraulic conductivity, and void ratio. The numerical solutions for the pore pressure change are obtained using a finite volume method. The expression for compaction and consolidation of aquitard is derived. A parametric study and comparison between the proposed model and the Terzaghi model indicate that the nonlinear permeability and the rheological nature reduce the pore pressure change and the degree of consolidation in the aquitard. The effects are more apparent for an aquitard with a higher compressibility and more obvious non-Darcian flow nature. Meanwhile, the reduction in pore pressure change decreases the effective stress acting on the soil skeleton, resulting in smaller compaction for an aquitard with more obvious nonlinear permeability, rheological property and non-Darcian flow nature. Besides, although the higher nonlinear compressibility also reduces the pore pressure change, yet it can induce more significant compaction in the aquitard.

AB The detection and estimation of trends in the presence of noise, periodicities, or discontinuous patterns is important in hydrology and climate research studies. The basic idea of currently available trend estimation techniques (tests) is that the trends should be smooth and monotonic; however, hydro-climatologic variables contain Multiple signals, and have segments of increasing and decreasing trends. As a result. estimating trends in time series is an essential but arcane art and it is therefore important to continue developing the theory and practice of trend analysis.
   In this paper, a new technique is proposed based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). CWT permits the transformation of observed time series into wavelet coefficients according to time and scale simultaneously. These coefficients can be used to detect and estimate trends or to reconstruct signals that are of interest. The proposed CWT method was first tested on computer-gene rated data exhibiting both periodic and noise components. It was then applied to observed monthly minimum streamflow observations extracted from the Reference Hydrometric Basin Network (RHBN) for five different eco-zones in Canada.
   It was concluded that the proposed wavelet transform (WT) based method provides a very flexible and accurate tool for detecting and estimating complicated signals. The results from monthly minimum observations indicate that short period fluctuations are decreasing, while multi-annual variability is increasing in Canada. And finally, a persistent similar to 55-year signal is well correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in all records, which indicates that trends are not controlled by a single factor.

AB The finite-volume technique is used to solve the two-dimensional shallow-water equations on unstructured mesh consisting of quadrilateral elements. In this paper the algorithm of the finite-volume method is discussed in detail and particular attention is paid to accurately representing the complex irregular computational domain. The lower Yellow River reach from Huayuankou to Jiahetan is a typical meandering river. The generation of the computational mesh, which is used to simulate the flood, is affected by the distribution of water works in the river channel. The spatial information about the two Yellow River levee, the protecting dykes, and those roads that are obviously higher than the ground, need to be used to generate the computational mesh. As a result these dykes and roads locate the element interfaces of the computational mesh. In the model the finite-volume method is used to solve the shallow-wave equations, and the Osher scheme of the empirical function is used to calculate the flux through the interface between the neighbouring elements. The finite-volume method has the advantage of using computational domain with complex geometry, and the Osher scheme is a method based on characteristic theory and is a monotone upwind numerical scheme with high resolution. The flood event with peak discharge of 15 300 m(3)/s, occurring in the period from 30 July to 10 August 1982, is simulated. The estimated result indicates that the simulation method is good for routing the flood in a region with complex geometry. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Equilibrium detention storage is an important parameter as it has a proportional effect on flood attenuation. In this paper, based on the kinematic wave theory, a working formula for the equilibrium detention storage of an overland plane with upstream inflow has been derived. Since the flow regime over a concrete plane can very throughout the entire range laminar to turbulent, this case has been selected to examine the effect of flow regime on the equilibrium detention storage. In the examination, the derived formula has been applied to four flow regimes: (a) laminar, (b) transitional, (c) near turbulent, and (d) turbulent. The examination shows that for planes with a small discharge, laminar flow gives the maximum detention storage. For planes with a medium discharge, transitional flow gives the maximum detention storage, and for planes with a large discharge, near turbulent flow gives the maximum detention storage. The flow regime can cause more than two-fold increase in dentention storage. All these results can be attributed to the respective flow resistance, and have been endorsed with analyses of the water surface profile and the rising limb of the hydrograph. Finally, relating the results to real-life situations, it shows that the flow regime that gives the maximum detention storage is also the dominating flow regime in nature. Hence, extraordinarily, the flow regimes that exist in nature in fact provide maximum flood attenuation. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

AB Soil moisture is an integral quantity in hydrology that represents the average conditions in a finite volume of soil. In this paper, a novel regression technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented and applied to soil moisture estimation using remote sensing data. SVM is based on statistical learning theory that uses a hypothesis space of linear functions based on Kernel approach. SVM has been used to predict a quantity forward in time based on training from past data. The strength of SVM lies in minimizing the empirical classification error and maximizing the geometric margin by solving inverse problem. SVM model is applied to 10 sites for soil moisture estimation in the Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB) in the western United States. The sites comprise low to dense vegetation. Remote sensing data that includes backscatter and incidence angle from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are used to estimate soil water content (SM). Simulated SM (%) time series for the study sites are available from the Variable Infiltration Capacity Three Layer (VIC) model for top 10 cm layer of soil for the years 1998-2005. SVM model is trained on 5 years of data, i.e. 1998-2002 and tested on 3 years of data, i.e. 2003-2005. Two models are developed to evaluate the strength of SVM modeling in estimating soil moisture. In model I, training and testing are done on six sites, this results in six separate SVM models - one for each site. Model II comprises of two subparts: (a) data from all six sites used in model I is combined and a single SVM model is developed and tested on same sites and (b) a single model is developed using data from six sites (same as model II-A) but this model is tested on four separate sites not used to train the model. Model I shows satisfactory results, and the SM estimates are in good agreement with the estimates from VIC model. The SM estimate correlation coefficients range from 0.34 to 0.77 with RMSE less than 2% at all the selected sites. A probabilistic absolute error between the VIC SM and modeled SM is computed for all models. For model I, the results indicate that 80% of the SM estimates have an absolute error of less than 5%, whereas for model II-A and II-B, 80% and 60% of the SM estimates have an error less than 10% and 15%, respectively. SVM model is also trained and tested for measured soil moisture in the LCRB. Results with RMSE, MAE and R of 2.01, 1.97, and 0.57, respectively show that the SVM model is able to capture the variability in measured soil moisture. Results from the SVM modeling are compared with the estimates obtained from feed forward-back propagation Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) and Multivariate Linear Regression model (MLR); and show that SVM model performs better for soil moisture estimation than ANN and MLR models.

AB Characterization of spatial and temporal variability of stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of surface waters is essential to interpret hydrological processes and establish modern isotope-elevation gradients across mountainous terrains. Here, we present stable isotope data for river waters across Kyrgyzstan. River water isotopes exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity among different watersheds in Kyrgyzstan. Higher river water isotope values were found mainly in the Issyk-Kul Lake watershed, whereas waters in the Son-Kul Lake watershed display lower values. Results show a close delta O-18-delta H-2 relation between river water and the local meteoric water line, implying that river water experiences little evaporative enrichment. River water from the high-elevation regions (e.g., Naryn and Son-Kul Lake watershed) had the most negative isotope values, implying that river water is dominated by snowmelt. Higher deuterium excess (average d = 13.9 parts per thousand) in river water probably represents the isotopic signature of combined contributions from direct precipitation and glacier melt in stream discharge across Kyrgyzstan. A significant relationship between river water delta O-18 and elevation was observed with a vertical lapse rate of 0.13 parts per thousand/100 m. These findings provide crucial information about hydrological processes across Kyrgyzstan and contribute to a better understanding of the paleoclimate/elevation reconstruction of this region.

AB A novel electronic sensing system (SAS2) was designed to non-invasively and simultaneously measure snow density, liquid water content, and temperature of snow using acoustics and obtain images of the snowpack. The system is an updated and more sophisticated version of previous acoustic sensing systems, and this paper presents an update on the development of acoustic sensing methods to measure multiple snowpack properties and obtain images of snowpack stratigraphy. Air-coupled acoustic waves were sent into and reflected from the snowpack by the SAS2 system. An inverse model based on a modified version of the Biot-Stoll theory of sound propagation through porous media was used to obtain acoustic measurements of snow and images of the snowpack. The SAS2 was deployed at ten field sites in the Canadian Rockies. Stationary and portable versions of the system were deployed and tested. This paper reports initial tests of the SAS2 that were conducted at the field sites to compare acoustic model outputs with gravimetric measurements of snow density, dielectric measurements of liquid water content, and thermocouple and thermometer measurements of snow temperature. Snow water equivalent could be estimated more accurately and quickly with the SAS2 than with an ESC30 gravimetric snow tube. Unlike monopulse sonar and radar sensors, the SAS2 utilizes a continuous-wave Maximum Length Sequence (MLS) that is more robust to environmental noise. The SAS2 serves as a proof-of-concept of the acoustic snow measurement technique with potential for further research as identified and discussed in this paper.

AB Contamination of groundwater by intruding seawater is a major problem in many parts of the world. This work derives novel analytical solutions for addressing this problem by extending the Girinskii-Strack concept of discharge potential to represent regional, steady-state, sharp-interface seawater intrusion in a sloping unconfined coastal aquifer. The aquifer has hydraulic conductivity K, is recharged uniformly at the rate r, receives an inflow at its land boundary and has a collector trough (or well gallery idealised as line sink) located at the distance I-w from the coastline that penetrates the aquifer and draws groundwater at the rate q(w). The theory rests on the approximation of a linearised gravity-part of the hydraulic potential. Analytical solutions for the discharge potential are derived, through which the hydraulic head, the flow depth and the sharp interface, and particularly the location of the interface toe, l(T), are also determined. These solutions simplify to known results for the horizontal aquifer case. The utility (and robustness to uncertainty regarding the base slope) of the results in applications is demonstrated in the regional example of the Akrotiri Coastal Aquifer, Cyprus. Recasting the problem in non-dimensional form provides a relationship for the dependence of the relative interface toe location l(T)/l(w) on the appropriately normalised difference between the groundwater flow just up-gradient of the collector trough, q(o), and the pumping rate, q(w), given values of the base slope, r/K and H-sea/l(w), where H-sea is the sea-surface elevation above the aquifer base at the coastline. That relationship frames a common groundwater management problem in coastal aquifers subject to a certain exploitation scheme, with l(T) as decision variable. In an exploratory demonstration study, non-dimensional sets of performance curves are calculated for the regional Akrotiri aquifer. In general, the derived analytical solutions can be used for first-order assessments of seawater intrusion vulnerability and management possibilities across a wide range of current regional coastal aquifer conditions and/or projected water demand, groundwater management and climatic change scenarios.

AB We study temporal correlations and multifractal properties of long river discharge records from 41 hydrological stations around the globe. To detect long-term correlations and multifractal behaviour in the presence of trends, we apply several recently developed methods [detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), wavelet analysis, and multifractal DFA] that can systematically detect and overcome non-stationarities in the data at all time scales. We find that above some crossover time that usually is several weeks, the daily runoff's are long-term correlated, being characterized by a correlation function C(s) that decays as C(s) similar to s(-gamma). The exponent gamma varies from river to river in a wide range between 0.1 and 0.9. The power-law decay of C(s) corresponds to a power-law increase of the related fluctuation function F-2(s) similar to s(H) where H = 1 - gamma/2. We also find that in most records, for large times, weak multifractality occurs. The Renyi exponent tau(q) for q between -10 and +10 can be fitted to the remarkably simple form tau(q) = -ln(a(q) + b(q))/ln2, with solely two parameters a and b between 0 and 1 with a + b >= 1. This type of multifractality is obtained from a generalization of the multiplicative cascade model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Annual rainfall variations and processes in the upper vadose zone exert a profound influence on the chemical and isotopic compositions of waters of carbonate aquifers in semi-arid climatic zones. In order to define these processes we have studied the surface temperatures during rainfall events, the isotopic composition of rain, infiltrating and groundwaters. This study was carried out within a karstic terrain (Soreq Cave), Israel, located in Cenomanian dolomitic rocks, approximately 40 km inland of the Mediterranean Sea, and 400 m above sea level. The climate is typical of the Eastern Mediterranean semi-arid conditions, with a rainy winter and dry summer and the average annual rainfall in the area is similar to 500 mm.
   Close monitoring indicates that the delta D and delta(18)O values of individual rainstorm events decrease with increasing rainfall. Annual average isotopic values of years with rainfall of 500-600 mm do not vary systematically. Years with extreme rainfall values define a negative covariation between the delta(18)O and rainfall. The delta D-delta(18)O relationship of all rain events of more than 20 mm fall on the Mediterranean Meteoric Water Line (MMWL) with a slope of similar to 8 and d-excesses of 20-30%. These rain events occur when mid-winter surface temperatures are 5 to 10 degrees C. Rainfall events of less than 20 mm, mainly occurring at above 10 degrees C, have slopes of less than 8 and smaller d-excess as a consequence of evaporation processes beneath the clouds.
   Two main water-types infiltrating into the cave are recognized: slow- and fast-drip. Slow-drip occurs from the tips of stalactites and takes place throughout the year; these waters represent seepage water that remains in the upper vadose zone for up to several decades. Fast-drip emanates from fissures in the cave roof during the winter seasons; these waters represent vadose how with a short residence time of less than 1 year. The infiltration of the fast-drip water into the cave depends on the fracture system of the rock cover and on the intensity of the rainstorms. In the inner parts of the cave, where the rock cover is thick, fast-drip starts only after several massive (>20 mm) rainstorms, whereas below a thin roof the response time of fast-drip is a few hours to a few days after intensive rainstorms. Both fast- and slow-drip water fall on the MMWL, indicating that they are derived mainly from the relatively intensive rainstorms that compose about 2/3 of the annual rainfall. Although fast-drip water represents massive rainstorms, their delta(18)O and delta D values are nonetheless higher by similar to 1% and 10% respectively, relative to the average rainwater composition. This indicates that the fast-drip water consists predominantly of water derived from intensive rainstorms admired with a minor component of isotopically O-18- and D-enriched water, which is represented by the slow-drip waters. The fast-drip waters are derived mainly from massive rain events at surface temperatures of 5 to 10 degrees C, which thermally equilibrate with the host rock and upon reaching the cave they have already acquired the mean temperature (similar to 20 degrees C) of the cave.

AB In alluvial coastal aquifers, finer sediments are preferentially deposited along the downstream direction, so the hydraulic conductivity is generally heterogeneous and changes with distance from the coastline. To investigate the influence of aquifer heterogeneity on seawater-groundwater interaction, a new two-dimensional model characterising groundwater flow in an aquifer-aquitard system was developed assuming that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer linearly increases with the distance from the coastline along the inland direction. A closed-form analytical solution was derived using the separation-of-variables method. Comparing the new solution with the numerical solution by comsol Multiphysics (Sweden) based on the finite-element method, one can see that the new solution agreed with the numerical solution very well except at the early time. We found that both aquitard leakance and the heterogeneity factor (b) could result in the propagation bias. The propagation bias represents the inconsistency between the theoretical calculation and the observed strong attenuation and small time lag between the head and tide fluctuations. The attenuation decreased with perpendicular distance from the coastline (x-axis), whereas the time lag increased with distance along the x-axis. The relationship between the time lag and the distance along the x-axis seemed to be linear when b was 0.001m(-1), whereas it obeyed a power function when b was greater than 0.01m(-1).

AB Runoff signatures, including low flow, high flow, mean flow and flow variability, have important implications on the environment and society, predominantly through drought, flooding and water resources. Yet, the response of runoff signatures has not been previously investigated at the global scale, and the influencing mechanisms are largely unclear. Hence, this study makes a global assessment of runoff signature responses to the El Nino and La Nina phases using daily streamflow observations from 8217 gauging stations during 1960-2015. Based on the Granger causality test, we found that similar to 15% of the hydrological stations of multiple runoff signatures show a significant causal relationship with El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO). The quantiles of all runoff signatures were larger during the El Nino phase than during the La Nina phase, implying that the entire flow distribution tends to shift upward during El Nino and downward during La Nina. In addition, El Nino has different effects on low and high flows: it tends to increase the low and mean flow signatures but reduces the high flow and flow variability signatures. In contrast, La Nina generally reduces all runoff signatures. We highlight that the impacts of ENSO on streamflow signatures are manifested by its effects on precipitation (P), potential evaporation (PET) and leaf area index (LAI) through ENSO-induced atmospheric circulation changes. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive picture of runoff signature responses to ENSO, with valuable insights for water resources management and flood and drought disaster mitigation.

AB Supraglacial channels are an important mechanism for surface water transport over the ablation zone of western Greenland. The first assessment of the spatio-temporal distribution of surface melt channels and their relationship to supraglacial lakes over the Jakobshavn Isbrae region of Western Greenland was analysed using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus panchromatic images during the 2007 melt season. A total of 1188 melt channels were delineated and show an increase in the number of melt channels throughout the season, reaching a peak on 9 August. Water-filled melt channels advanced to amaximum elevation of 1647m on 9 August and attained a minimumaverage slope of 0.009 on 8 July. The ablation zone demonstrates two hydrologic modes, where crevasse and moulin terminating channels dominate at elevations <800m and higher-order channel networks >800m. Development of higher-order networks is interrupted by flow divergence due to partitioning of melt water into vertical infiltration through moulins and crevasse fields prevalent at lower elevations. Tributary and connector networks between 800 and 1200m in elevation are correlated with fewer lake occurrences, lower surface velocities (similar to 50ma(-1)), and ice flow dominated by internal deformation over basal sliding. High-order channels are associated with lake basins that exceed melt water storage capacity. Evolution of channel networks is coupled to changes in melt water production, runoff, and ice dynamics with implication for the englacial and subglacial environments. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Temporal patterns in specific runoff, dissolved organic carbon concentrations [DOC] and fluxes were examined during two periods: 1994-1997 (period 1) and 2007-2009 (period 2) in five adjacent tributary catchments of Lake Simcoe, the largest lake in southern Ontario, Canada. The catchments displayed similar patterns of land use change with increases in urbanization (5-16%) and forest cover (0.2-4%) and declines in agriculture (4-8%) between 1994 and 2008. Climate in the catchments was similar; temperature increased slightly, but no significant change in precipitation was observed. Despite similar pattern of climate and land use, runoff responses and tributary [DOC] were different across the catchments. Following a very dry year (i.e. 1999), runoff increased steadily until the end of record. We observed increased variability in tributary [DOC] and higher DOC exports in period 2. This led to similar to 10% increase in [DOC] and a 13% increase in flux between the two study periods. Between the two periods, [DOC] increased by 15% in spring and 25% in summer, whereas flux increased by 17% in spring and 48% in summer. [DOC] was consistently higher in the growing (summer+autumn) than the dormant (winter+spring, minus spring melt months) seasons, but no unique pattern or simple linear flow/concentrations relationships existed. This suggests complex spatial and temporal pattern to runoff controls on DOC and flow dynamics in adjacent catchments. We therefore caution against extrapolating from monitored to unmonitored catchments. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Environmental controls on evapotranspiration were investigated at a sparse grassland in Mongolia during 2003 and 2004. The study site was located on the southern periphery of the Eurasian cryosphere. Data from Eddy covariance, aerodynamic, and manual measurements were used in the analysis. A decoupling factor (Omega) was calculated to determine the relative importance of surface conductance and radiation to change in evapotranspiration rates. Higher evapotranspiration rates associated with a higher frequency of large Omega values revealed the importance of radiation forcing on evapotranspiration at this study site. As Omega increases', the aerodynamic conductance (g(a)) increased correspondingly but vegetation conductance (g(c)) decreased. Aerodynamic conductance (g(a)) was well fitted to an exponential function of the wind stress; g(c) clearly decreased as the vapour pressure deficit (d) increased; g(c) related to air temperature through d. Although grass cover was sparse at the study site, the anticipated effect of soil moisture on E and g(s) was only slightly suggested and thus not deducible. On the 10-day-interval time scale, the effect of vegetation cover on evapotranspiration was insignificant compared to that of surface soil moisture. Changes in soil evaporation, related to precipitation, mainly caused the very large inter-annual differences in evapotranspiration. The relationship between evapotranspiration and surface bulk resistance at the study site could therefore be fit to an exponential function. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The sedimentary sequences containing lithologic units with low permeability represent hydrogeologic systems, which, as of now, have been little studied despite their diffusion worldwide. A hydrogeologic study, aimed to assess the main factors controlling the groundwater flow dynamics in such systems and their hydraulic interactions with nearby carbonate aquifers, has been carried out in Longano (Isernia, Southern Italy). The analysis of the hydraulic heads, combined with the regimes of the springs and the electric conductivity of the groundwater, mainly reflect vertical and lateral heterogeneities of the media in terms of hydraulic properties. In particular, the flow system is controlled by lateral heterogeneities, which characterize a surficial horizon made up of clayey colluviums and talus deposits, separated from the deeper saturated, fissured bedrock. One-to-ten relationships in hydraulic heads, monitored in piezometers crossing the fissured media, further uphold the crucial role played by the lateral contrasts of permeability in controlling the flow dynamics. On the whole, significant interactions with the nearby carbonate hydrostructure take place. Nevertheless, the heterogeneities of the siliciclastic succession and surficial horizon, coupled with the compartmentalization of the carbonate system, lead to a complex hydrogeological scenario. In a wider perspective, this study gives information of utmost importance in order to improve the implementation of mathematical models and configuration of tapping works within these heterogeneous and complex settings.

In Northeastern China, summer (June to August) streamflow accounts for about 50% of total annual streamflow and is vital to water supply and management in the region. Understanding how forest recovery may affect streamflow is important to both reforestation campaign and long-term water sustainability. In this study, we analysed 33 years of summer hydrologic data (1970-2002) from two comparable small-scale watersheds located in the Xiaoxing'anling, Northeastern China. Time series analysis and two graphic methods (double mass curve and flow duration curve) with statistical testing as well as long-term data on forest cover changes and climate were used. Our results show that the significant streamflow reduction as a result of reforestation occurred when forest cover reached 70% or 10 years after planting. After forest cover reached 85%, water reduction became stabilized. The accumulative streamflow reduction in 2002 reached 8.61% of the total accumulative streamflow. Among those water reduced, high flows (from 5 to 25 percentiles) were mostly affected, demonstrating that northeastern forests have an important role in reducing high flows. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of climate change, reforestation and water resource management. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB An appropriate, rapid and effective response to extreme precipitation and any potential flood disaster is essential. Providing an accurate estimate of future changes to such extreme events due to climate change are crucial for responsible decision making in flood risk management given the predictive uncertainties. The objective of this article is to provide a comparison of dynamically downscaled climate models simulations from multiple model including 12 different combinations of General Circulation Model (GCM)-regional climate model (RCM), which offers an abundance of additional data sets. The three major aspects of this study include the bias correction of RCM scenarios, the application of a newly developed performance metric and the extreme value analysis of future precipitation. The dynamically downscaled data sets reveal a positive overall bias that is removed through quantile mapping bias correction method. The added value index was calculated to evaluate the models' simulations. Results from this metric reveal that not all of the RCMs outperform their host GCMs in terms of correlation skill. Extreme value theory was applied to both historic, 1980-1998, and future, 2038-2069, daily data sets to provide estimates of changes to 2- and 25-year return level precipitation events. The generalized Pareto distribution was used for this purpose. The Willamette River basin was selected as the study region for analysis because of its topographical variability and tendency for significant precipitation. The extreme value analysis results showed significant differences between model runs for both historical and future periods with considerable spatial variability in precipitation extremes.

AB We propose in this article a regional study of uncertainties in IDF curves derived from point-rainfall maxima. We develop two generalized extreme value models based on the simple scaling assumption, first in the frequentist framework and second in the Bayesian framework. Within the frequentist framework, uncertainties are obtained i) from the Gaussian density stemming from the asymptotic normality theorem of the maximum likelihood and ii) with a bootstrap procedure. Within the Bayesian framework, uncertainties are obtained from the posterior densities. We confront these two frameworks on the same database covering a large region of 100, 000 km(2) in southern France with contrasted rainfall regime, in order to be able to draw conclusion that are not specific to the data. The two frameworks are applied to 405 hourly stations with data back to the 1980's, accumulated in the range 3 h-120 h. We show that i) the Bayesian framework is more robust than the frequentist one to the starting point of the estimation procedure, ii) the posterior and the bootstrap densities are able to better adjust uncertainty estimation to the data than the Gaussian density, and iii) the bootstrap density give unreasonable confidence intervals, in particular for return levels associated to large return period. Therefore our recommendation goes towards the use of the Bayesian framework to compute uncertainty. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This investigation was carried out within the Parana sedimentary basin and involved the sampling of 78 pumped tubular wells for evaluating the hydrochemistry and radioactivity due to the nuclides U-238, U-234, Ra-222, Ra-226, and Ra-228 in the Brazilian part of Guarani aquifer. Several significant correlations were found involving the geostatic pressure, for instance, specific flow rate, CO32-, SO42- temperature, dissolved O-2, free CO2, pH, redox potential Eh, conductivity, Na, HCO3-, CO32- , SIcalcite, Cl-, F-, SO42-, and B. Carbonates precipitation was evidenced by inverse correlation between CO32- and Ca, Mg, Sr, and Ba, whereas Na exhibited an opposite trend, dissolving rather than precipitating with increasing CO32- concentration. An inverse correlation between 3 and K was found, possibly related to the increasing tendency of K to recombine with the thickness of the clayey layers. HCO3-played an important role on Na, Ca, Mg, and Sr dissolution. The dissolved U content and U-234/U-238 activity ratio data were plotted on a two-dimensional diagram that was successfully utilized on identifying an unreported zone of U accumulation, though not necessarily of economic size and grade. The variability in chemical and radionuclides data indicated an important influence of the underlying Paleozoic sediments in the composition of waters from Guarani aquifer. The available data allowed estimate the groundwater residence time by two U-isotopes disequilibrium methods. Values of 45-61 ka were initially calculated, depending on the adopted porosity (15-20%), but a longer residence time (- 640 ka) was also estimated, which is more compatible with the hydraulic conductivity data in Guarani aquifer and groundwater flow velocity occurring at Milk River aquifer, Alberta, Canada. Such time range agrees with previously reported C-14 ages exceeding 30 ka BP at the more central parts of the Parana sedimentary basin. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Better parameterization of a hydrological model can lead to improved streamflow prediction. This is particularly important for seasonal streamflow forecasting with the use of hydrological modelling. Considering the possible effects of hydrologic non-stationarity, this paper examined ten parameterization schemes at 12 catchments located in three different climatic zones in east Australia. These schemes are grouped into four categories according to the period when the data are used for model calibration, i.e. calibration using data: (1) from a fixed period in the historical records; (2) from different lengths of historical records prior to prediction year; (3) from different climatic analogue years in the past; and (4) data from the individual months. Parameterization schemes were evaluated according to model efficiency in both the calibration and verification period. The results show that the calibration skill changes with the different historic periods when data are used at all catchments. Comparison of model performance between the calibration schemes indicates that it is worth calibrating the model with the use of data from each individual month for the purpose of seasonal streamflow forecasting. For the catchments in the winter-dominant rainfall region of south-east Australia, a more significant shift in rainfall-runoff relationships at different periods was found. For those catchments, model calibration with the use of 20?years of data prior to the prediction year leads to a more consistent performance. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The Gurbantonggut Desert, China, is an ideal site for study of sublimation from the snowpack because there are sparse vegetation and simple topography, and the wind speed is not large enough to blow snow into the atmosphere from the snowpack. Daily sublimation was measured by manual snow lysimeters at 8:00, and an automatic weather station was deployed at the top of a stout longitudinal dune chain at the southeastern edge of the desert. It is shown that on a daily scale, there was an extremely significant no-intercept linear relationship between the measured sublimation and that calculated by the bulk aerodynamic method, although the former was only 83.8% of the latter. It is also demonstrated that -10 degrees C and 2?m/s were the thresholds where the sublimation varied with the air temperature and the wind speed. When these two thresholds were exceeded, the sublimation accelerated. However, the air temperature and the wind speed at 2?m above the ground averaged -17.2 degrees C and 1.3?m/s, respectively, and the percentages of the time when the air temperature was below -10?degrees C and the wind speed was below 2?m/s were 76.9% and 85.1%, respectively. As a result, the rate of sublimation was quite low most of the time, and the thin snowpack remained in a quasi-static state until the melt stage started. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Water table fluctuations and transpiration were monitored in a seasonally inundated Melaleuca quinquenervia floodplain forest at Cowley Beach, north Queensland, Australia. Techniques were developed to reconstruct inundation duration and seasonal and inter-annual variability at this site using long-term stream flow data. It was estimated that the median duration of inundation in any year was 75 days with maximum and minimum durations of 167 days and 8 days, respectively. Measurements of individual tree transpiration using heat-pulse techniques showed a strong relationship between tree size and tree water use, which was used for scaling to stand transpiration. Stand transpiration rates were found to be closely tied to atmospheric drivers of evaporation, and transpiration of M. quinquenervia was found to be unaffected by inundation. This ability to transpire during inundation may be due to physiological adaptations of this species. These adaptations are believed to include dynamic root systems that can quickly respond to rising and falling water tables and dense networks of fine apogeotropic roots, which grow on and within the papery bark. Rates of stand transpiration remained low throughout the study (0-46 mm d(-1), 164 mm y(-1)) despite the fact that transpiration was not limited by solar energy inputs or soil moisture deficit. Low stand transpiration was attributed to the low density, stunted nature and small sapwood area of trees at this site. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Isotopic heterogeneity in soil water has hindered the application of isotope compositions (delta O-18 and delta H-2) in soil water dynamics. This heterogeneity has been suggested to be caused by soil properties such as organic matter (OM) and clay content. However, this is yet to be verified in field soil. We sampled the organic layer (O-horizon soil) with highly decomposed organic material and the A-horizon soil in western Sichuan, China, and equilibrated these samples with vapour created by unconfined labelling water. The relationship between soil properties and isotopic fractionation (epsilon(T/U)) between unconfined water and the total soil water was used to determine the line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) and source rain of A-horizon field soil by removing the influence of confined water. Equilibration experiments demonstrated a significant isotopic difference between the epsilon(T/U) levels in the A-horizon and O-horizon soils, indicating that OM plays an important role in isotopic fractionation. In field samples, the lc-excess of the unconfined A-horizon water was, on an average, 2.5 parts per thousand higher than that of bulk soil water. The average offsets between the annual rain and the estimated source rain of soil water decreased by 5.0 and 0.5 parts per thousand for hydrogen and oxygen after removing the influence of confined water. Isotopic heterogeneity should not be ignored while examining the evaporation of soil water, soil source rain, and hence the recent 'two water worlds' hypothesis, which is especially true for cases in which the soils contain high levels of OM.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important hydrological process that can be studied and estimated at multiple spatial scales ranging from a leaf to a river basin. We present a review of methods in estimating basin scale ET and its applications in understanding basin water balance dynamics. The review focuses on two aspects of ET: (i) how the basin scale water balance approach is used to estimate ET; and (ii) how direct measurement and modelling approaches are used to estimate basin scale ET. Obviously, the basin water balance-based ET requires the availability of good precipitation and discharge data to calculate ET as a residual on longer time scales (annual) where net storage changes are assumed to be negligible. ET estimated from such a basin water balance principle is generally used for validating the performance of ET models. On the other hand, many of the direct estimation methods involve the use of remotely sensed data to estimate spatially explicit ET and use basin-wide averaging to estimate basin scale ET. The direct methods can be grouped into soil moisture balance modelling, satellite-based vegetation index methods, and methods based on satellite land surface temperature measurements that convert potential ET into actual ET using a proportionality relationship. The review also includes the use of complementary ET estimation principles for large area applications. The review identifies the need to compare and evaluate the different ET approaches using standard data sets in basins covering different hydro-climatic regions of the world.

AB Many important microbial, chemical and physical processes in soils take place within water-filled pores. Whilst the behaviour of chemicals and micro-organisms in aqueous conditions has often been thoroughly researched, their behaviour in soils is still difficult to predict. One approach to this is to superimpose models of the behaviour of chemicals and micro-organisms in water onto a model of the behaviour of water in soil. In this paper we set out to demonstrate the potential to use a simple cellular automaton rule set to describe the location of water in a soil matrix under varying conditions of matric suction for possible future combining with other process models.
   The model used a three-dimensional array of pixels (which could be solid or void) to represent the structure of a small volume of soil. Parameters describing the porosity and the proportion of void pixels directly adjacent to solid pixels were used to define the structure. These were derived from image analysis of resin impregnated samples of a silty clay, silt loam and sandy loam. Ballotini beads were also used as a further "soil type". Water retention under a range of increasing suctions (1-300 kPa) was modelled and compared with measurements made using conventional methods on the same soils.
   The cellular automaton rule set generally produced a good description of water release from soils. Errors were largely attributable to limits on the maximum and minimum particle sizes which could be represented in the present model due to limitations of computing power. This approach to modelling soil water offers many opportunities for understanding complex interactions between soil water and other processes occurring in soils. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The New York City water supply region, located in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, has always had a historically variable snow cover, with consequent effects on the magnitude of spring runoff and the relative importance of winter versus spring periods on annual hydrologic and nutrient budgets. Simulations show that under present conditions (1966-2005), on average 38% (12%-70%) of the annual total dissolved phosphorus load occurs during winter (Nov-Feb), while future predictions (2046-2065 and 2081-2100) show winter nutrient loads may account for an average of 46% (18%-73%) of the annual load. It is expected that changes in the importance of winter nutrient loading will lead to some increase in phytoplankton growth under isothermal conditions prior to the onset of thermal stratification, a reduced bloom coinciding with the onset of thermal stratification, and on an annual basis somewhat lower levels of biomass. However, future climate simulations using two different one-dimensional reservoir water quality models show no strong relationship between changes in algal biomass and the proportion of winter nutrient loading. The lack of a winter response calls into question model assumptions concerning the growth potential of phytoplankton under deeply mixed low light conditions, as well as factors influencing the bioavailability of nutrients input during the winter period. This illustrates the pitfalls of simulating future climate conditions, when the seasonality of model drivers has changed, and processes regulating winter conditions are not strongly represented.

AB In the present study, a 2-year dataset on delta O-18 and delta H-2 in precipitation is used to investigate hydrometeorologic controls on the isotopic compositions in a temperate maritime climate. Data was collected in Denmark along a transect of Six sampling stations across a landscape with a small topographic gradient and predominant westerly winds. Data showed the local meteoric water line for this region is expressed by the equation delta H-2 = 7.4 delta O-18 + 5.4 parts per thousand. A significant trend correlating enriched isotopic values to humidities around 70% during dry season and more depleted isotopic values to humidities around 90% during wet season was derived from the dataset. Temperature was found to only influence the isotopic composition in a secondary way, whereas no significant relationship was obtained for precipitation amount and evapotranspiration. It is suggested that subcloud post-condensation exchange strongly influences the isotopic composition at the study site. A simple model of evaporation on falling rain was applied with the aim to reproduce observational data and show the potential influence of changing humidity conditions on precipitation compositions. The rather simple model approach did not fully explain the observational data, but it highlights the drastic isotopic changes from a falling raindrop that potentially can occur due to its release into a dryer atmosphere. This study shows that regional conditions and especially humidity can alter the isotopic composition in precipitation substantially even in regions without major topographic and hydrometeorologic gradients.

AB Tree-ring reconstructions of streamflow are uncommon in the eastern United States compared with the western United States. Although the east has not experienced severe drought on the scale of the west over the last 100 ears, multiyear droughts have stressed the water management systems throughout the east. Here, we reconstruct mean May-September streamflow of three rivers serving population centers in the northeast (Beaver Kill River serving New York, NY), mid-Atlantic (Potomac River serving Washington, DC), and southeast (Flint River serving Atlanta, GA) to demonstrate the efficacy of reconstructing streamflow in the eastern United States. Then, we conducted an interbasin comparison to identify periods of common variability and examined the influence of the North Atlantic subtropical high on reconstructed streamflow. Our models explained 40-61% of the variance in the instrumental record and passed verification tests in all basins during the period 1675-2000 CE. Droughts and pluvials showed some synchrony across all basins, but the mid-Atlantic region acted as a hinge, sometimes behaving more like the northeast, and other times like the southeast. Climatic analyses suggest a relationship exists between the North Atlantic subtropical high and reconstructed streamflow that influences the probability of drought and pluvial events. Given the many factors influencing tree growth in closed-canopy systems, we have shown that careful standardization of individual tree-ring series, nested regression models, and the use of multiple species can produce robust proxies of streamflow across the eastern seaboard.

AB In efforts to reduce uncertainties about effects of minor changes in the pore structure of porous media on dynamic nonequilibrium effects (DNEs), we monitored water saturation-capillary pressure relationships in both dynamic flow and static states in stepwise drainage processes of a sandy medium. The acquired data were used to detect DNE and their changes with time in each drainage step and construct new parameters to characterize DNE. Effects of factors affecting water flow-including capillary number, water saturation, rate of change of water saturation with time (Delta S-w/Delta t), and the maximum value of this rate (RSMAX)-on the magnitude of the DNE were then determined. Results show that entry pressures are considerably larger under dynamic flow conditions than under static flow conditions, and DNE only occurs when the water saturation exceeds a threshold value in a drainage process. During either a smooth drainage or drainage step, the maximum capillary pressure (PMAX) is reached before the minimum water saturation (SMIN). Moreover, in drainage steps RSMAX occurs before the maximum difference between the capillary pressures associated with the static and dynamic states (DPMAX), except when they start from the saturated state. Accordingly, DNEs in a drainage step are mainly reflected in the time between PMAX and SMIN (Delta t), DPMAX, the average sum of the squares of the difference between capillary pressures of the static and dynamic states (DPAVE), and the dynamic coefficient tau (which is often used to characterize DNE). Furthermore, our results indicate that the water saturation and its rate of change with time are more important parameters than the capillary number for modeling DNE in a drainage process, and we detected no clear correlation between either maximum or minimum values of and the timing of the most significant DNE during drainages. tau appears to characterize DNE effectively in smooth drainage processes, while Delta t, DPAVE, and DPMAX constitute meaningful supplementary parameters for the characterization of DNE in a drainage step of a stepwise drainage.
   Plain Language Summary We investigated both smooth and stepwise drainage processes, and the influences of the (i) capillary number, (ii) water saturation, and (iii) rate of change of water saturation with time on the magnitude of DNE were determined. We found that entry pressures are considerably larger under dynamic flow conditions than under static flow conditions, and DNE only occurs when the water saturation exceeds a threshold value in a drainage process. During either a smooth drainage or drainage step, the maximum capillary pressure (PMAX) reaches earlier than the minimum water saturation (SMIN). The magnitude of the DNE is more correlated with the water saturation and its change ratio with respect to time, rather than with the capillary number. DNE in a drainage step is mainly reflected in the time between PMAX and SMIN (Delta t), DPMAX, the average sum of the squares of the difference between capillary pressures of the static and dynamic states (DPAVE), and the dynamic coefficient tau. We also detected that tau appears to characterize DNE effectively in smooth drainage processes, while Delta t, DPAVE, and DPMAX constitute meaningful supplementary parameters for the characterization of DNE in a drainage step of a stepwise drainage.

AB The interaction between landscape and stream processes has been well documented, and thus it is plausible to assume that landscape factors in a given watershed have a determinant function in stream network initiation and formation. Although past research has identified certain general relationships between stream drainage density and other environmental factors, no definite model for stream delineation has yet emerged. Particularly at smaller scales, drainage network extraction approaches have been devised that are generally independent of often widely heterogeneous landscape conditions. Utilizing digital terrain models alone for this purpose is, in many cases, problematic and inaccurate. This research effort involved using an artificial neural network (ANN) for the exploration of a number of environmental factors and information extracted from satellite images (Landsat 7 ETM+) with regard to finding the most indicative factors for drainage network location. The environmental variables included a series of available topographic, soil and lithology factors. Two hydrologically and geographically diverse case studies, one in Pennsylvania and the other in southern Italy, were used to this end. The results show that various spectral band ratios (1/4, 2/4 and 3/4) were mutually identified as significant in both case studies. Additionally, both case studies illustrated that different factors belonging to general parameter groups (soil and topography parameters) were identified by the ANN for each case, suggesting that future drainage network derivation methodologies should possibly consider that certain groups of environmental factors are more important for certain geographic regions than for others.

AB The possibility of determining snow water equivalent (SWE) by the use of an acoustic impulse was assessed at two field locations in Saskatchewan and British Columbia, Canada. These sites represent cold windswept prairie and temperate deep mountain snowcovers. A continuous frequency-swept acoustic wave was sent into the snowpack and received. Signal processing was then subsequently used to estimate the depth and density of each snow layer by a recursive relationship involving frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and seismological techniques. From this method, it is also shown that the tortuosity of snow can be estimated. Data collected by gravimetric sampling was used as comparison to the SWE values determined by the use of acoustic sounding. The results showed that for the Saskatchewan sites, the correlation between the measured and the modeled values of SWE was 0.86, whereas at the British Columbia sites, the correlation was 0.78. The difference in the correlations was interpreted as being due to additional acoustic measurement error at the British Columbia sites caused by higher liquid water contents and more layers in the snowpack. The measured and the modeled SWE for Saskatchewan snowpacks with high liquid water contents were found to be weakly associated with correlations of 0.30. The acoustically-determined values of tortuosity were close to unity (alpha approximate to 1), which is in agreement with the values characteristic of snow as a porous substance. Further research is necessary to determine whether this technique can be applied to snow in other environmental conditions. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The thesis put forward here is that the occurrence of Fickian dispersion in geophysical settings is a rare event and consequently should be labeled as anomalous. What people classically call anomalous is really the norm. In a Lagrangian setting, a process with mean square displacement which is proportional to time is generally labeled as Fickian dispersion. With a number of counter examples we show why this definition is fraught with difficulty. In a related discussion, we show an infinite second moment does not necessarily imply the process is super dispersive. By employing a rigorous mathematical definition of Fickian dispersion we illustrate why it is so hard to find a Fickian process. We go on to employ a number of renormalization group approaches to classify non-Fickian dispersive behavior. Scaling laws for the probability density function for a dispersive process, the distribution for the first passage times, the mean first passage time, and the finite-size Lyapunov exponent are presented for fixed points of both deterministic and stochastic renormalization group operators. The fixed points of the renormalization group operators are p-self-similar processes. A generalized renormalization group operator is introduced whose fixed points form a set of generalized self-similar processes. Power-law clocks are introduced to examine multi-scaling behavior. Several examples of these ideas are presented and discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of spatio-temporal soil-water content (SWC) variability in agricultural fields is useful for improving crop management. Spatial patterns of SWC can be characterized using temporal stability analysis of difficult-to-obtain data from high spatial density and temporal frequency. Soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements with high spatial density have been widely used to infer the spatial variability of SWC. The objective of this work is to test the hypothesis that temporal stability of ECa can be demonstrated and that relationships between temporal stability characteristics of SWC and ECa can be established. Apparent electrical conductivity and topsoil gravimetric SWC (theta) were periodically measured in an olive orchard in southwest Spain on 6 and 18 occasions, respectively. A temporal stability analysis of ECa elucidated three zones where ECa was close to, consistently substantially smaller than, and substantially larger than the spatial average ECa throughout the study period. Representative locations for theta were found with a chance of 75% within the representative zone for ECa. Yet, the driest locations, with consistently smaller 0 than the field average (<theta >), could be successfully identified (89%) within the zone with consistently smaller ECa than average. The theta - <theta > relations showed generally a linear behaviour, although a better fit was obtained at the highest theta using either exponential or power law equations at half of the locations. The former provided the best fit within the zone with ECa consistently smaller than average, while the latter performed best in the zone with ECa consistently larger than average. The linear equation provided the best fit within the representative ECa zone. This study demonstrates that temporal stability characteristics of ECa and SWC are linked and that ECa surveys can be used to delimit zones with representative locations for SWC measurement or estimation. Such information is of importance for a range of agricultural applications, i.e. irrigation, crop protection, fertilizer management, and soil and water conservation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Identification and pairing of hydrologic events form the basis of various analyses, from identifying events for the calibration of hydrologic models, to calculation of event runoff coefficients for catchment characterization. Despite this, there is no unified approach for identifying hydrologic events. Here, using the R package, hydroEvents (), we compare multiple methods of extracting and pairing hydrologic events focussing on the relationship between rainfall and runoff. We find the four common analytical approaches used to identify runoff events-based on either event threshold, local maxima/minima, or proportion of baseflow contribution, give similar results. However, when rainfall events are paired to runoff, the type of algorithm and the direction of pairing (either from rainfall to runoff, or runoff to rainfall) make a considerable difference to the final event pairs identified and resulting analyses. Here, we demonstrate the value of automated event extraction and pairing algorithms for large-sample hydrology analysis by calculating event runoff coefficients across Australia. Our results show that climatology is a key driver of catchment rainfall-runoff response with much of Australia dominated by excess rainfall runoff generation. However, our results also show that the variability due to pairing method can introduce a variability equal to that of the climatology due to biasing the runoff mechanism within the sample. With this analysis we demonstrate the importance of systematic and consistent approaches to hydrologic characterization when identifying and pairing hydrological events.

ID REGIONAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
AB A novel approach has been found to estimate the equilibrium surface temperature (T-e) of wet environment evaporation (E-w) on a daily basis. Employing this temperature in the Priestley-Taylor equation as well as in the calculation of the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve with pan measurements improved the accuracy of longterm mean evaporation (E) estimation of the Advection-Aridity (AA) model when validated by Morton's approach. Complementarity of the potential evaporation (E-P) and E terms was considered both on a daily and a monthly basis with the involved terms always calculated daily from 30 yr of hourly meteorological. measurements of the 1961-1990 period at 210 SAMSON stations across the contiguous US. The followings were found: (a) only the original Rome wind function of Penman yields a truly symmetric Complementary Retationship between E and E-P which makes the so-obtained E-P estimates true potential evaporation values; (b) the symmetric version of the modified AA model requires no additional parameters to be optimized; (c) for a tong-term mean value of evaporation the modified AA model becomes on a par with Morton's approach not only in practical applicability but also in its improved accuracy, especially in and environments with possible strong convection; (d) the latter two models yielded long-term mean annual evaporation estimates with an R-2 of 0.95 for the 210 stations, which is all the more remarkable since they employ very different approaches for their E-P calculations; (e) with identical, apparent EP values the two models yielded practically identical long-term mean annual evaporation rates; (f) with the proper choice of the wind function to estimate apparent E-P the tong-term mean annual E estimates of the modified AA model are still very close (R-2 = 0.93) to those of the Morton approach.

AB Two implementations of the complementary relationship hypothesis for regional evapotranspiration, the Complementary Relationship Areal Evapotranspiration (CRAE) model and the Advection-Aridity (AA) model, are evaluated against independent estimates of regional evapotranspiration derived from long-term, large-scale water balances (1962-1988) for 120 minimally impacted basins in the conterminous United States. The CRAE model overestimates annual evapotranspiration by 2.5% of mean annual precipitation, and the AA model underestimates annual evapotranspiration by 10.6% of precipitation. Generally, increasing humidity leads to decreasing absolute errors for both models, and increasing aridity leads to increasing overestimation by the CRAE model and underestimation by the AA model, with the exception of high, arid basins, where the AA model overestimates evapotranspiration. Overall, the results indicate that the advective portion of the AA model must be recalibrated before it may be used successfully on a regional basis and that the CRAE model accurately predicts monthly regional evapotranspiration.

AB Headwaters are generally assumed to contribute the majority of water to downstream users, but how much water, of what quality and where it is generated are rarely known in the humid tropics. Here, using monthly monitoring in the data scarce (2,370 km(2)) San Carlos catchment in northeastern Costa Rica, we determined runoff-area relationships linked to geochemical and isotope tracers. We established 46 monitoring sites covering the full range of climatic, land use and geological gradients in the catchment. Regression and cluster analysis revealed unique spatial patterns and hydrologically functional landscape units. These units were used for seasonal and annual Bayesian tracer mixing models to assess spatial water source contributions to the outlet. Generally, the Bayesian mixing analysis showed that the chemical and isotopic imprint at the outlet is throughout the year dominated by the adjacent lowland catchments (68%) with much less tracer influence from the headwaters. However, the headwater catchments contributed the bulk of water and tracers to the outlet during the dry season (>50%) despite covering less than half of the total catchment area. Additionally, flow volumes seemed to be linearly scaled by area maintaining a link between the headwaters and the outlet particularly during high flows of the rainy season. Stable isotopes indicated mean recharge elevations above the mean catchment altitude, which further supports that headwaters were the primary source of downstream water. Our spatially detailed "snap-shot" sampling enabled a viable alternative source of large-scale hydrological process knowledge in the humid tropics with limited data availability.

AB The local meteoric water line (LMWL), the functional relationship between locally measured values of delta O-18 and delta H-2 in precipitation, represents the isotopic composition of water entering hydrologic systems. The degree to which the LMWL departs from the global meteoric water line (GMWL), moreover, can reveal important information about meteoric sources of water (e.g. oceanic or terrestrial) and atmospheric conditions during transport. Here we characterize the isotopic composition of precipitation within an experimental watershed in the Western US that is subject to large topographic and seasonal gradients in precipitation. Interpreting the hydrometeorologic and spatial controls on precipitation, we constructed a seasonally weighted LMWL for southwestern Idaho that is expressed by the equation delta H-2 = 7.40 x delta O-18 - 2.17. A seasonally weighted LMWL that is based on weighting isotopic concentrations by climatic precipitation volumes is novel, and we argue better represents the significant seasonality of precipitation in the region. The developed LMWL is considerably influenced by the semiarid climate experienced in southwest Idaho, yielding a slope and y-intercept lower than the GMWL (delta H-2 = 8 x delta O-18 + 10). Moderate to strong correlations exist between the isotopic composition of precipitation from individual events and surface meteorologic variables, specifically surface air temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation amount. A strong negative correlation exists between the annual average isotopic composition of precipitation and elevation at individual collection sites, with a lapse rate of -0.22%/100 m.

AB The Tabernas desert, an extensive badlands area in Almeria province (south-east Spain), is characterized by a high variability in soil surface cover and soil properties along with important topographical contrasts giving rise to a wide range of hydrological behaviour. A double approach through field monitoring and modelling has been used to ascertain the influence of soil-surface variability on the overall hydrological response.
   Small plots were monitored for 3 years to assess runoff from the different surface types. Data provided by the long-term monitoring of three small catchments formed by different soil surfaces were used to find out the specific contribution of each soil surface to the catchment runoff.
   A simple spatially distributed model was built to predict runoff generation based on the infiltration rate of each soil-surface type (defined as terrain units with the same cover, the same soil type and on the same landform). Plot results prove that the soil surface units within the study area behave differently in terms of hydrological response to natural rainfall. These responses are explained by the types of cover, topographical characteristics and soil properties. When runoff events are simple (with one or two runoff peaks), the modelled hydrographs reproduce the hydrographs observed reasonably well, but in complex events (with several runoff peaks) the adjustment is not as good. The model also shows the influence of the spatial distribution of soil surfaces on the overall runoff, aiding exploration of the spatial hydrological relationships among different landscape units.

AB In this paper, six critical topics in social learning (SL) definition and applications are discussed: 1- Clarification of the SL definition; 2- The role of SL in the management of shared water resources; 3- The definition of "learning" in SL; 4- The quantification of SL; 5- The relation of SL with outputs of Social Networks Analysis (SNA) and stakeholder Analysis (SA); 6- Identifying and ranking of key stakeholders (i.e., influencers) for SL diffusion. After defining SL, we present SL's role using a well-known game theory problem. We have addressed the term "learning" in SL using an existing method, namely reinforcement learning. We present a new approach for quantifying SL within a hydrological environment and finding key stakeholders for the SL diffusion. For the first time, we consider a combination of SL, SA, and SNA to propose a comprehensive social-based approach to investigate SL diffusion. The western part of Tehran city, which is suffering from some water and environmental issues such as overexploitation of groundwater and land subsidence, is the case study of this paper. The results show a significant relationship between SL and the outputs of SNA. The suggested method for identifying key stakeholders has been able to identify key stakeholders in terms of various water resources management issues in the study area. The results can be used for developing effective policies towards sustainable management of water and environmental resources in the studied socio-hydrological system.

AB The objective of this study is to examine the dynamic complexity of hydrologic basins using techniques of phase space reconstruction. These non-parametric, model-free techniques which have their basis in the theory of chaotic dynamical systems are advantageous in resurrecting the features of multivariable dynamics solely from one-dimensional timeseries. Dynamic complexity is characterized by two measures directly interpretable as number of active degrees of freedom (dimensionality) and strength of nonlinearity. The analysis is conducted on daily streamflow observations of 408 basins from the Model Parameter Estimation Project (MOPEX) dataset spanning a wide range of climatic, topographic and land surface properties. The results show that the two complexity measures vary considerably across basins; however, their distributions are positively skewed, indicating that most basins exhibit low dimensionality and moderate nonlinearity. By examining how dynamic complexity relate to a set of 15 basin properties, it was found that dynamics dimensionality is primarily related to basin size; precisely larger basins exhibit lower dimensional dynamics. On the other hand, strength of nonlinearity is found to be regulated by the extent of vegetation in land cover. Specifically, basins with limited vegetation cover tend to have more linear dynamics. Furthermore, some observations regarding the presence of chaotic dynamics and the relationship between dynamic complexity and accuracy of prediction are presented. The results of this study have implications and potential relevance to catchment similarity and classification frameworks as well as model selection and extrapolation of model parameters to ungauged basins.

AB Particle selectivity plays an important role in clarifying sediment transport processes in vegetative filter strips (VFS). 10-m long grass strips at slopes of 5 degrees and 15 degrees were subjected to a series of sediment-laden inflows experiments with different particle sizes to investigate the sediment transport and its response to overland flow hydraulics. The inflow sediments came from local soil, river-bed sand, and mixed, with median particle size d(50) of 39.9, 207.9 and 77.4 mu m, respectively. Three independent repeated experiments were carried for each treatment. The results show that when the sediment trapping lasted for a certain length of time, the re-entrainment of some small-sized particles was greater than the deposition; that is, net loss occurred, which was not erosion of the original soil. Net loss of particles is mainly determined by the particle diameter. The coarser the inflow sediment particles and/or the steeper the slope, the coarser the particles can be net lost. Deposited sediment causes the VFS bed surface to become smooth and hydraulic resistance decrease exponentially. Unit stream power P is more suitable than shear stress tau of overland flow to be used to describe the process of sediment particle transport in VFS. The relationship between P and d(50) of outflow sediment is very consistent with the form of power function with a constant term. These results are helpful to understand the physical process of sediment transport on vegetation hillslopes.

AB We studied the variations in water and carbon dioxide fluxes of a saline desert in western China using the eddy covariance technique. In addition, bare-soil evaporation was measured using the micro-lysimeter method. The following three inquiries were made: (1) the magnitude of evapotranspiration (ET) and net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) and how these components vary seasonally; (2) how NEE and ET vary following rain pulses of different magnitudes; and (3) how ET divides into evaporation and transpiration and its relationship to carbon dioxide exchange. The saline desert acted as a net C sink of - 49 g C m-2 year-1, with a gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) of 345 g C m-2 year-1 and an ecosystem respiration (Reco) of 296 g C m-2 year-1. Rainfall pulses exerted strong control over ecosystem-scale water and CO2 fluxes. There was a 1 to 2 days lag in maximal ET despite the magnitude of rainfall pulses, while NEE took 45 days to reach its peak if the rainfall was large enough to increase the photosynthetic activity of vascular plants. Overall, the ratio of total transpiration to ET was 38%, but it was about 92% during the months when the vascular plants were active. The NEE was increasingly more negative as the growing season progressed, indicating a greater net uptake of CO2 and a greater water use efficiency. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper addresses the question of how hydrologists and other researchers can contribute most to water management practice. It reviews the literature in the field of science and technology studies and research utilization and presents the results in the form of seven "rules" for researchers. These are (1) Reflect on the nature and possible roles of science and expertise; (2) Analyze the stakeholders and issues at stake; (3) Choose whom and what to serve; (4) Decide on your strategy; (5) Design the process to implement your strategy; (6) Communicate!; and (7) Consider your possibilities and limitations. A key notion in this paper is that research always involves selection and interpretation and that the selection and interpretations made in a specific case always reflect the values and preferences of those involved. Collaboration between researchers and the other stakeholders can increase the legitimacy and utilization of the research and can prevent the researchers' specific expertise from being lost.

AB The traditional drought identification indices are usually based on the assumption of stationarity, which should no longer act as a fundamental and central theory of hydrological studies in global warming context. This study develops a time-varying framework for drought identification, characterization, and frequency analyzation: firstly, a nonstationary Standardized Precipitation Index (mnSPI) is developed to modify the time-varying linear relationships with both distribution parameters and clarify the explicit expressions incorporating large-scale climate indices as covariates as well. Then time-varying copulas are employed to evaluate the potential risk of drought events. As one of the most sensitive and vulnerable regions in response to climate change, the Jinsha River Basin (JRB) is selected as the study area to test the framework. Our results indicate that comparing with the traditional SPI, the mnSPI is superior in disclosing the trend of temporal and spatial changes of JRB over 1969-2018. In general, drought events have experienced a trend of first slowing down and then aggravating, while severely arid areas have shifted from the northwest to the central and eastern regions, and then to the southwest in JRB. Besides, it is likewise important to consider nonstationarity when carrying out the drought monitoring and early warning system (M&EW). Still more work needs to be done in dynamically identifying droughts involving teleconnection of climate factors.

AB Post-logging changes in catchment sediment yield have traditionally been attributed to increases in hillslope erosion and delivery rates as a result of forest harvesting activities. Linking hillslope erosion to catchment yield in forestry environments remains difficult, however, primarily because of the scarcity of data on the nature of hillslope sediment storage and delivery processes. A large rainfall simulator (350 m(2)) was used to apply rainstorms to a logged hillslope containing a snig track (skid trail) and a general logging Or harvesting area (GHA) on 10 forest compartments in south-eastern Australia. The experiments confirmed that the compacted, disturbed surfaces, such as roads and tracks, are the dominant sources of sediment in forestry areas. Sediment transport rates were limited by available sediment supply on both the snig track and the GHA, introducing important implications for the modelling of these surfaces using sediment transport capacity theories. Sediment delivery from the snig track to the adjacent GHA, via a cross-bank (drainage diversion), was strongly influenced by the percentage fine fraction in the eroded sediment. Preferential deposition of coarse aggregates was measured at erosion control structures and on the adjacent GHA. Over 50% of fine-grained material were deposited on the hillslope over a relatively short, flow path length of <5 m, highlighting the effectiveness of runoff diversion as a practice in reducing sediment flux. The transfer of water and sediment from disturbed to less disturbed parts of the landscape, and the associated potential for sediment storage, needs to be considered as part of any catchment impact assessment.

AB Temporal variation of runoff chemistry and its seasonal controls relating to chemical weathering processes and drainage system evolution were examined at Urumqi Glacier No.1 in Xinjiang, China, over a full melt season. The dominant ions in meltwater runoff are HCO3-, Ca2+, and SO42-; and Fe, Sr, and Al are dominant elements. Concentrations of major ions and some elements show periodic variations with seasons and negatively correlate with discharge, whereas other elements (e.g., Al, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) show a random change, providing insights into the hydrological and physicochemical controls. HCO3- and Ca2+ are primarily derived from calcite, SO42- and Fe mainly come from pyrite, and Sr and Al principally originate from silicate. Hydrochemical fluxes of solutes exhibit strong seasonality but are positively related to discharge, suggesting an increasing release of solutes during higher flow conditions. Solute yields, cation denudation rate, and chemical weathering intensity observed at Urumqi Glacier No.1 are higher than those at most basins worldwide. This suggests that chemical weathering in central Asia may be stronger than at other glacial basins with similar specific discharge. Concentrations of some elements (e.g., Fe, Al, As, Pb, and Zn) are close to or exceed the guidelines for drinking water standards in meltwater-fed rivers. These rivers may face future challenges of water quality degradation, and relationships between changing flow and water quality conditions should be established soon, given that development of channelized flow is expected to be earlier over a melt season in a warming climate.

AB Reliable estimation of low flows at ungauged catchments is one of the major challenges in water-resources planning and management. This study aims at providing at-site and ungauged sites low-flow frequency analysis using regionalization approach. A two-stage delineating homogeneous region is proposed in this study. Clustering sites with similar low-flow L-moment ratios is initially conducted, and L-moment-based discordancy and heterogeneity measures are then used to detect unusual sites. Based on the goodness-of-fit test statistic, the best-fit regional model is identified in each hydrologically homogeneous region. The relationship between mean annual 7-day minimum flow and hydro-geomorphic characteristics is also constructed in each homogeneous region associated with the derived regional model for estimating various low-flow quantiles at ungauged sites. Uncertainty analysis of model parameters and low-flow estimations is carried out using the Bayesian inference. Applied in Sefidroud basin located in northwestern Iran, two hydrologically homogeneous regions are identified, i.e. the east and west regions. The best-fit regional model for the east and west regions are generalized logistic and Pearson type III distributions, respectively. The results show that the proposed approach provides reasonably good accuracy for at-site as well as ungauged-site frequency analysis. Besides, interval estimations for model parameters and low flows provide uncertainty information, and the results indicate that Bayesian confidence intervals are significantly reduced when comparing with the outcomes of conventional t-distribution method.

AB A method was developed to investigate the long-term (months-to-years) effects (both magnitude and duration) of antecedent rainfall upon subsequent runoff coefficients (RCs) or runoff/rainfall ratios. The method was applied to a four-state region (Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia) within the southeastern Piedmont Province of the United States and incorporated a 59-year data set of 19 United States Geological Survey stream gages and 57 National Climatic Data Center rain gages. The method was designed to facilitate statistical comparisons [Mann-Whitney rank sum tests] between various groups of normalized runoff coefficients (NRCs) representing 6-36 month periods which differed in terms of antecedent rainfall conditions. The results of this study show that under all subsequent rainfall conditions, with the exception of excess rainfall, a 1-year period of antecedent drought lowered NRCs for at least 1 year following the drought. The principal finding of this study is that a year-long drought period within the southeastern Piedmont Province lowers NRCs by similar to 25% during the following year when rainfall returns to normal. In most cases, RCs are significantly lower during the second year following a drought than they would be when anteceded by normal rainfall; however, the effects of drought wane during this period. This is a statistical and regional method that can be modified to other study areas; however, it cannot be used to predict storm-event rainfall-runoff relationships for any specific basin.

AB Daily river inflow time series are highly valuable for water resources and water environment management of large lakes. However, the availability of continuous inflow data for large lakes is still relatively limited, especially for large lakes situated within humid plain regions with tens or even hundreds of tributaries. In this study, we choose the fifth largest freshwater Lake Chaohu in China as our study area to introduce a new approach to reconstruct historical daily inflows at ungauged subcatchments of large lakes. This approach makes use of water level, lake surface rainfall, evaporation from the lake, and catchment rainfall observations. Rainfall-runoff relationship at a reference catchment was analysed to select rainfall input and estimate run-off coefficient firstly, and the run-off coefficient was then transferred to ungauged subcatchments to initially estimate daily inflows. Run-off coefficient was scaled to adjust daily inflows at ungauged subcatchments according to water balance of the lake. This approach was evaluated using sparsely measured inflows at eight subcatchments of Lake Chaohu and compared with the commonly used drainage area ratio method. Results suggest that the inflow time series reconstructed from this approach consistent well to corresponding observations, with mean R-2 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values of 0.69 and 0.6, respectively. This approach outperforms drainage area ratio method in terms of mean R-2 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values. Accuracy of this approach holds well when the number of water-level station being used decreased from four to one.

AB Small unoccupied aerial systems (sUASs) are increasingly applied to study hydrologic processes and water quality. Here, we evaluate a novel application of sUAS to stream turbidity monitoring, with the goal of extending analyses implemented with satellite remote sensing to enable high resolution, rapid collection of turbidity imagery along smaller waterbodies. To accomplish this, we collected multispectral imagery using two sUAS platforms under a range of environmental conditions along a local creek in Syracuse, NY. In addition, we collected in situ turbidity observations immediately after each flight along several transects along the creek, as well as within a clear plume created by a natural spring entering the main channel of the creek. The in situ turbidity values were compared with the mean and standard deviation of several single-band and multiband indices extracted along similar transects from the sUAS flights. On the basis of data collected across several flights, we found optical metrics obtained from multispectral imagery correlated well with in situ turbidity measurements. Though many optical metrics yielded strong relationships considering only values within the main channel, values associated with the red band were strongly related to turbidity estimates from the main channel as well as lower turbidity values observed in the spring plume. Although there are still limitations of this approach associated with variable field conditions, results from this proof of concept analysis show that sUASs offer a promising avenue for cost-effective turbidity monitoring.

AB Hydropeaking due to operations of storage hydropower plants was highlighted as one of the main stresses on aquatic ecology by the European Water Framework Directive. Nevertheless, hydropower must be seen as a high-value resource in the renewable energy sector. However, very few studies deal with the physical processes behind the artificial unsteady flows, as the variability of local river morphology and roughness in general. Thus, the aim of the present study is to address these issues on the basis of one-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical modelling. In total, four Austrian rivers have been investigated, which were further divided into 13 sub-reaches according to their bed slope. From single and multiple linear regression models, it was possible to relate potential retentions of peak flow for peak duration of <2h and for bed slopes <0.005 to the spatial extent of wetted width between base and peak flows, independent of the selected ramping rate (discharge relationship between base and peak flows). Moreover, the ramping velocity (rate of decreasing water level between peak and base flows) correlated positively with an increase in depth variance during peak flow, which was related further to an increase in mean flow velocities and a higher specific discharge over the 13 selected reaches. Nevertheless, within sensitivity testing, it could be proven that increases in channel roughness cause an increase in peak flow retention and a decrease of the ramping velocities for the decreasing limb.

AB The frequency and intensity of drought is projected to increase within the boreal region under future climatic conditions. Peatlands are widely considered to regulate water loss under drought conditions, increasing surface resistance (r(s)) and reducing evaporative losses. This maintains peat moisture content, increasing the resilience of these globally important carbon stores. However, the magnitude and form of this important negative feedback response remains uncertain. To address this, we monitored the response of r(s) to drought within four peat cores under controlled meteorological conditions. When the water-table was dropped to a depth of 0.30m and the humidity reduced to <= 40%, a step shift in r(s) from similar to 50 s m(-1) up to 1000 s m(-1) was observed within burned and unburned peat, which virtually shuts down evaporation, limiting water loss. We show that measured near-surface tension cannot be used to directly calculate this transition in peat surface resistance. However, empirical relationships that account for strong vertical variations in tension through the near-surface and/or disequilibrium between pore air and near-surface pore water pressure provide the potential to incorporate this negative feedback response into peatland ecohydrological models. Further observations are necessary to examine this response under dynamic atmospheric conditions. We suggest that the link between surface temperature and evaporation provides potential to further examine this feedback in either burned peatlands or peatlands with a low vascular vegetation cover.

AB A temporal artificial neural network-based model is developed and applied for long-lead rainfall forecasting. Tapped delay lines and recurrent connections are two different components that are used along with a static multilayer perception network to design a time-delay recurrent neural network. The proposed model is, in fact, a combination of time-delay and recurrent neural networks. The model is applied in three case studies of the Northwest, West, and Southwest basins of Iran. In addition, an autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) model is used as a baseline in order to be compared with the time-delay recurrent neural networks developed in this study. Large-scale climate signals, such as sea-level pressure, that affect the rainfall of the study area are used as the predictors in the models, as well as the persistence between rainfall data. The results of winter-spring rainfall forecasts are discussed thoroughly. It is demonstrated that in all cases the proposed neural network results in better forecasts in comparison with the statistical ARMAX model. Moreover, it is found that in two of three case studies the time-delay recurrent neural networks perform better than either recurrent or time-delay neural networks. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the long-lead forecast by utilizing a non-linear relationship between climatic predictors and rainfall in a region.

AB Understanding the variation regularity of water level and the potential drivers can provide insights into lake conservation and management. In this study, inter- and inner-annual variations of water level in Dongting Lake during the period of 1961-2010 were analyzed to determine whether anthropogenic or climatic factor should be responsible for the variations. The results showed that water level decreased significantly during the period of 1961-1980, while increased significantly during the period of 1981-2002 at the 5% significance level. However, the variation trend of water level after 2002 did not reach a significant level. The variation in the dry season was more obviously than that in the wet season. The date when water level was firstly below 24 m during the period of 2003-2010 appeared about 27 days earlier than usual, and the date was even advanced to mid-September in 2006. As for the duration, water level was below 24 m for about 185 days in the period of 2003-2010 and 20-30 days longer than the other two periods. In conclusion, water level might be influenced by a combination of anthropogenic and climatic factors, with rainfall probably as the main driver responsible for hydrological alteration during the period of 1961-1980 and 1981-2002 while dam construction as the main driver during the period of 2003-2010. Under the circumstance of uncontrollable climate change, effective measures for reservoir operation should be put forward to maintain the ecological integrity and ensure water release and storage capacity of aquatic ecosystems.

AB An environmental concern with hydraulic fracturing for shale gas is the risk of groundwater and surface water contamination. Assessing this risk partly involves the identification and understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions because potentially contaminating fluids could move from one water body to the other along hydraulic pathways. In this study, we use water quality data from a prospective shale gas basin to determine: if surface water sampling could identify groundwater compartmentalisation by low-permeability faults; and if surface waters interact with groundwater in underlying bedrock formations, thereby indicating hydraulic pathways. Variance analysis showed that bedrock geology was a significant factor influencing surface water quality, indicating regional-scale groundwater-surface water interactions despite the presence of an overlying region-wide layer of superficial deposits averaging 30-40 m thickness. We propose that surface waters interact with a weathered bedrock layer through the complex distribution of glaciofluvial sands and gravels. Principal component analysis showed that surface water compositions were constrained within groundwater end-member compositions. Surface water quality data showed no relationship with groundwater compartmentalisation known to be caused by a major basin fault. Therefore, there was no chemical evidence to suggest that deeper groundwater in this particular area of the prospective basin was reaching the surface in response to compartmentalisation. Consequently, in this case compartmentalisation does not appear to increase the risk of fracking-related contaminants reaching surface waters, although this may differ under different hydrogeological scenarios.

AB Rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are used in the design of urban infrastructure. Their estimation is based on rainfall frequency analysis, usually performed on rainfall records from a single gauged station. However, available at-site record length is often too short to provide accurate estimates for long return periods. In the present study, a general framework for pooled rainfall frequency analysis based on the index-event model is proposed for IDF estimation at gauged stations. Pooling group formation is defined by the region of influence approach on the basis of the geographical distance similarity measure. Several pooled approaches are defined and evaluated by a procedure through which quantile estimation and uncertainty are assessed. Alternate approaches for the definition of a pooling group are based on different criteria regarding initial pooling group size (and the relationship between size and return period), approaches for assessing pooling group homogeneity, and the use of macroregions in pooling group formation. The proposed framework is applied to identify the preferred approach for pooled rainfall intensity frequency analysis in Canada. Pooled approaches are found to provide more precise estimates than the at-site approach, especially for long return periods. Pooled parent distribution selection supported the use of the generalized extreme value distribution across the country. Recommendations for pooling group formation include increasing the pooling group size with increases in return period and identifying an appropriate trade-off between pooling group homogeneity and size for long return periods.

AB Since the winter season of 2004-2005, annual snow assessments have been conducted for the major watersheds of Afghanistan using multispectral (AVHRR and MODIS) and passive microwave (SSM/I and AMSR-E) remote sensing technologies. Because of limited ground-based observations of precipitation and snow pack conditions, remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to assess these conditions at different scales offering an appraisal of current conditions from a historical context. This paper describes the methodology that has been developed over the past seven winter seasons, wherein bi-weekly snow products and assessments are produced including the following: current snow-covered area (SCA) at regional and watershed scales; estimation of SCA by elevation band; current snowpack volume [snow water equivalent (SWE)] for each watershed with a historical perspective (1987present); snow condition outlook by watershed; general summary of snow conditions based on remote sensing products and limited ground-based observations; and if warranted, a snow melt flooding advisory. Further analysis of these snow products and assessments are presented. Moreover, comparisons between both available passive microwave estimates of SWE (SSM/I and AMSR-E) for all watersheds differ in magnitude yet exhibit similar historical trends. The SSM/I versus AMSR-E historical differences in SWE for each of the major Afghanistan watersheds are quantified and show a strong relationship (R2 =96%) to the mean elevation of the watershed.

AB The effect of forests on annual water yield is an unresolved central issue in forest hydrology despite years of study. There has been a particular shortage of research in the mountains of arid inland river basins. In the present study, we examined the effects of forests on hydrology using data on precipitation, evaporation, canopy interception, transpiration, and runoff from 1994 to 2008 for the Pailugou catchment of northwestern China's Qilian Mountains. We modelled the water balance to assess the contribution of different vegetation types to annual water yield. In our study area, Picea crassifolia forest covered 38.5% of the catchment area, but contributed little to annual water yield. For an annual average precipitation of 407.1 mm (from 2003 to 2008) at an elevation of 2700 m, the runoff depth from the forest was 11.6 mm, accounting for only 3.5% of total annual water yield of the catchment. For an annual average precipitation of 374.1 mm (from 1994 to 2002), the runoff depth from the forest was - 14.3 mm (i.e. 5.9% of total annual water yield of the catchment was consumed to sustain tree growth). This has significant implications, because forests are increasingly being planted in the Qilian Mountains, and this may decrease the downstream water supply. Thus, the relationship between the forest and water yield must be better understood to permit the establishment of an appropriate regional level of forest cover.

AB We used remotely sensed weekly snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow cover extent (SCE) data to investigate streamflow response to seasonal snowcover change over the Yukon watershed. We quantified the seasonal cycles and variations of snowcover (both SWE and SCE) and river streamflow, and identified a clear correspondence of river discharge to seasonal snowcover change. We also examined and compared the weekly mean streamflow with the weekly basin SWE and SCE. The results revealed a strong relation between the streamflow and snowcover change during the spring melt season. This relationship provides a practical procedure of using remotely sensed snowcover information for snowmelt runoff estimation over the large northern watersheds. Analyses of extreme (high/low) streamflow cases (years) and basin snowcover conditions indicate an association of high (low) flood peak with high (low) maximum SWE. Comparative analyses of weekly basin SWE versus SCE, peak snowmelt floods, and climatic variables (temperature and winter precipitation) indicate consistency among basin SWE, SCE, and temperature, but there is some incompatibility between basin SWE and winter precipitation. The inconsistency suggests uncertainties in determination of basin winter snowfall amounts and limitations in applications of the SWE retrieval algorithm over large watersheds/regions with different physical characteristics. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the weekly SWE and SCE data/products derived from remote sensing technology are useful in understanding seasonal streamflow changes in the northern regions.

AB River discharge in mountainous regions of the world is often dominated by snowmelt, but base flows are sustained primarily by groundwater storage and discharge. Although numerous recent studies have focused on base-flow discharge in mountain systems, almost no work has explicitly investigated the role of karst groundwater in these systems across a full range of flow conditions. We directly measured groundwater discharge from 48 karst springs in the Kaweah River and its five forks in the Sierra Nevada mountains, California, United States. Relationships between spring and river discharge showed that karst aquifers and springs provide significant storage and delayed discharge to the river. Regression models showed that, of all potential seasonal groundwater storage compartments in the river basin, the area of karst (0.1-4.4%) present provides the best explanation of base-flow recession in each fork of the Kaweah River (directly measured contributions from karst springs ranged from 3.5 to 16% during high-flow to 20 to 65% during base-flow conditions). These results show that, even in settings where karst represents a small portion of basin area, it may play an over-sized role in seasonal storage and water resources in mountain systems. Karst aquifers are the single most important non-snow storage component in the Kaweah River basin, and likely provide similar water storage capacities and higher base flows in other mountain river systems with karst when compared with systems without karst.

AB The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) are two important climate oscillations that affect hydrological processes at global and regional scales. However, few studies have attempted to identify their single and combined influences on water discharge variability at multiple timescales. In this study, we examine temporal variation in water discharge from the Yangtze River into the sea and explore the influence of the ENSO and the PDO on multiscale variations in water discharge over the last century. The results of the wavelet transform analysis of the water discharge series show significant periodic variations at the interannual timescale of 2 to 8years and the decadal timescale of 15 to 17years. Water discharge tended to be higher during the La Nina-PDO cold phase and lower during the El Nino-PDO warm phase. The results of the cross wavelet spectrum and wavelet coherence analyses confirm the relationship between the interannual (i.e., 2 to 8years) and decadal (i.e., 15 to 17years) periodicities in water discharge with the ENSO and the PDO, respectively. As an important large-scale climate background, the PDO can modulate the influence of the ENSO on water discharge variability. In general, the warm PDO enhances the influence of El Nino events, and the cold PDO enhances the influence of La Nina events. Our study is helpful in understanding the influencing mechanism of climate change on hydrological processes and provides an important scientific guideline for water resource prediction and management.

AB Large wood (LW) plays an important role in river ecosystems, but LW-laden floods may cause serious damage to human lives and property. The relationship between precipitation patterns and variations in LW distribution and export at the watershed scale is poorly understood. To explore these linkages, we examined differences in LW distribution as a function of channel morphologies in six watersheds located in southern and northern Japan and analysed the impacts of different precipitation patterns on the fluvial export of LW from river catchments. In southern Japan, intense rainfalls caused by typhoons or localized torrential downpours initiate landslides and debris flows that introduce massive amounts of LW into channels. Gravel bars formed by frequent flood events are widely prevalent, and the LW temporarily stored on these bars is frequently moved and/or broken into smaller pieces by floods. In these systems fluvial export of LW is supply-limited, with smaller accumulations and shorter residence times than in northern Japan. Conversely, in northern Japan, where typhoons and torrential downpours rarely occur, LW is mostly recruited by bank erosion, tree mortality and windthrow into channels, rather than by landslides and debris flows. Recruited pieces accumulate in log jams on valley floors, particularly on floodplains supporting mature forests, resulting in larger accumulations and longer residence times. In these watersheds fluvial export of LW is transport-limited, and the pieces gradually decompose during long-term storage as log jams. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Under a climate change, the physical factors that influence the rainfall regime are diverse and difficult to predict. The selection of skilful inputs for rainfall forecasting models is, therefore, more challenging. This paper combines wavelet transform and Frank copula function in a mutual information-based input variable selection (IVS) for non-linear rainfall forecasting models. The marginal probability density functions (PDFs) of a set of potential rainfall predictors and the rainfall series (predictand) were computed using a wavelet density estimator. The Frank copula function was applied to compute the joint PDF of the predictors and the predictand from their marginal PDFs. The relationship between the rainfall series and the potential predictors was assessed based on the mutual information computed from their marginal and joint PDFs. Finally, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance was used as an IVS stopping criterion to determine the number of skilful input variables. The proposed approach was applied to four stations of the Nigerien Sahel with rainfall series spanning the period 1950-2016 by considering 24 climate indices as potential predictors. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, artificial neural networks, and random forest-based forecast models were used to assess the skill of the proposed IVS method. The three forecasting models yielded satisfactory results, exhibiting a coefficient of determination between 0.52 and 0.69 and a mean absolute percentage error varying from 13.6% to 21%. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system performed better than the other models at all the stations. A comparison made with KDE-based mutual information showed the advantage of the proposed wavelet-copula approach.

AB The response time (lag time) between rainfall input and run-off output in headwater catchments is a key parameter for flood prediction. Lag times are expected to be controlled by run-off processes, both on hillslopes and in channels. To demonstrate these effects on peak lag times within a 4.5-km(2) catchment, we measured stream water levels at up to 16 channel locations at 1-min intervals and compared the lag times with topographic indices describing the length and gradient of the hillslope and channel flow path. We captured storm events with a total precipitation of 38-198mm and maximum hourly precipitation intensity of 9-90mm/hr. There were positive relationships between lag time and flow path length as well as the ratio of the flow path length and the square root of the gradient of channels for the most intense storms, demonstrating that channel flow paths generally defined the variation in lag times. Topographic analysis showed that hillslope flow path lengths were similar among locations, whereas channel flow path length increased almost one order of magnitude with a 100-fold increase in catchment area. Thus, the relative importance of hillslope flow path decreased with increasing catchment area. Our results indicate that the variation in lag times is small when hillslopes are sufficiently wet; thus, catchment-scale variation in lag times can be explained almost entirely by channel processes. Detailed topographic channel information can improve prediction of flood peak timing, whereas hillslopes can be treated as homogeneous during large flood events.

AB Field-saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, K-fs, is highly variable. Therefore, interpreting and simulating hydrological processes, such as rainfall excess generation, need a large number of K-fs data even at the plot scale. Simple and reasonably rapid experiments should be carried out in the field. In this investigation, a simple infiltration experiment with a ring inserted shortly into the soil and the estimation of the so-called * parameter allowed to obtain an approximate measurement of K-fs. The theoretical approach was tested with reference to 149 sampling points established on Burundian soils. The estimated K-fs with the value of first approximation of * for most agricultural field soils (*=0.012mm(-1)) differed by a practically negligible maximum factor of two from the saturated conductivity obtained by the complete Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters (BEST) procedure for soil hydraulic characterization. The measured infiltration curve contained the necessary information to obtain a site-specific prediction of *. The empirically derived * relationship gave similar results for K-fs (mean=0.085mms(-1); coefficient of variation (CV)=71%) to those obtained with BEST (mean=0.086mms(-1); CV=67%), and it was also successfully tested with reference to a few Sicilian sampling points, since it yielded a mean and a CV of K-fs (0.0094mms(-1) and 102%, respectively) close to the values obtained with BEST (mean=0.0092mms(-1); CV=113%). The developed method appears attractive due to the extreme simplicity of the experiment. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In distributed and coupled surface water-groundwater modelling, the uncertainty from the geological structure is unaccounted for if only one deterministic geological model is used. In the present study, the geological structural uncertainty is represented by multiple, stochastically generated geological models, which are used to develop hydrological model ensembles for the Norsminde catchment in Denmark. The geological models have been constructed using two types of field data, airborne geophysical data and borehole well log data. The use of airborne geophysical data in constructing stochastic geological models and followed by the application of such models to assess hydrological simulation uncertainty for both surface water and groundwater have not been previously studied. The results show that the hydrological ensemble based on geophysical data has a lower level of simulation uncertainty, but the ensemble based on borehole data is able to encapsulate more observation points for stream discharge simulation. The groundwater simulations are in general more sensitive to the changes in the geological structure than the stream discharge simulations, and in the deeper groundwater layers, there are larger variations between simulations within an ensemble than in the upper layers. The relationship between hydrological prediction uncertainties measured as the spread within the hydrological ensembles and the spatial aggregation scale of simulation results has been analysed using a representative elementary scale concept. The results show a clear increase of prediction uncertainty as the spatial scale decreases. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The objective of this work is to demonstrate the potential of using passive microwave data to monitor flood and discharge conditions and to infer watershed hydraulic and hydrologic parameters. The case study is the major flood in Iowa in summer 2008. A new Polarisation Ratio Variation Index (PRVI) was developed based on a multi-temporal analysis of 37 GHz satellite imagery from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) to calculate and detect anomalies in soil moisture and/or inundated areas. The Robust Satellite Technique (RST) which is a change detection approach based on the analysis of historical satellite records was adopted. A rating curve has been developed to assess the relationship between PRVI values and discharge observations downstream. A time-lag term has been introduced and adjusted to account for the changing delay between PRVI and streamflow. Moreover, the Kalman filter has been used to update the rating curve parameters in near real time. The temporal variability of the b exponent in the rating curve formula shows that it converges toward a constant value. A consistent 21-day time lag, very close to an estimate of the time of concentration, was obtained. The agreement between observed discharge downstream and estimated discharge with and without parameters adjustment was 65 and 95%, respectively. This demonstrates the interesting role that passive microwave can play in monitoring flooding and wetness conditions and estimating key hydrologic parameters. Copyright.

AB Previous investigations into factors influencing incubation success of salmonid progeny have largely been limited to the development of empirical relationships between characteristics of the incubation environment and survival to emergence. It is suggested that adopting a process-based approach to assessing incubation success aids identification of the precise causes of embryonic mortalities and provides a robust framework for developing amd implementing managerial responses.
   Identifying oxygen availability within the incubation environment as a limiting factor, a comprehensive review of trends in embryonic respiration, and processes influencing the flux of oxygenated water through gravel riverbeds is provided. The availability of oxygen to incubating salmonid embryos is dependent on the exchange of oxygenated water with the riverbed, and the ability of the riverbed gravel medium to transport this water at a rate and concentration appropriate to support embryonic respiratory requirements. Embryonic respiratory trends indicate that oxygen consumption varies with stage of development, ambient water temperature and oxygen availability. The flux of oxygenated water through the incubation environment is controlled by a complex interaction of intragravel and extragravel processes and factors. The processes driving the exchange of channel water with gravel riverbeds include bed topography, bed permeability, and surface roughness effects. The flux of oxygenated water through riverbed gravels is controlled by gravel permeability, coupling of surface-subsurface flow and oxygen demands imposed by materials infiltrating riverbed gravels. Temporally and spatially variable inputs of groundwater can also influence the oxygen concentration of interstitial water. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI On the relations between the hydrological dynamical systems of water
   budget, travel time, response time and tracer concentrations
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
DE extended petri nets; hydrological dynamical systems; response times;
   tracer concentrations; travel times
AB Using previous results on extended Petri Nets (EPN), we present the relations between various hydrological dynamical systems (HDSys) derived from the water budget. Once the water budget has been implemented, there is a consistent way of getting the equations for backward travel time distributions, for forward response time distributions and for the concentration of a solute or tracer. We show that the water budget has a correspondence of one to many with the backward travel time distributions. In fact, to any one of the water budget equations there correspond as many equations as there are input precipitation events. The backward travel time distributions are related to the response time distributions by Niemi's relationship and, if there are n outputs, by the definition of n - 1 partition functions. These determine what fraction of the water volume injected into the control volume at a specific time t(in) goes asymptotically to a specific output. Given the backward travel time distributions, the output concentration of a solute or tracer also depends on the input concentration. The paper clarifies the complicated relations described above by taking [Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 20, 299-328] as an example from literature. Once the appropriate information is presented, it is shown how these HDSys can be solved simultaneously without duplicating calculations. Then, it is also shown that, under the hypothesis of uniform mixing of water ages within each reservoir, these systems can be solved exactly.

AB The hydroclimatology of the Peruvian Amazon-Andes basin (PAB) which surface corresponding to 7% of the Amazon basin is still poorly documented. We propose here an extended and original analysis of the temporal evolution of monthly rainfall, mean temperature (T-mean), maximum temperature (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) time series over two PABs (Huallaga and Ucayali) over the last 40years. This analysis is based on a new and more complete database that includes 77 weather stations over the 1965-2007 period, and we focus our attention on both annual and seasonal meteorological time series. A positive significant trend in mean temperature of 0.09 degrees C per decade is detected over the region with similar values in the Andes and rainforest when considering average data. However, a high percentage of stations with significant T-mean positive trends are located over the Andes region. Finally, changes in the mean values occurred earlier in T-max (during the 1970s) than in T-min (during the 1980s). In the PAB, there is neither trend nor mean change in rainfall during the 1965-2007 period. However, annual, summer and autumn rainfall in the southern Andes presents an important interannual variability that is associated with the sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic Ocean while there are limited relationships between rainfall and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. On the contrary, the interannual temperature variability is mainly related to ENSO events. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The hydrologic properties of the geomorphologic instantaneous Unit hydrograph (GIUH) are analysed as a function of the topological properties of the channel network and hillslopes, the hydraulic characteristics of flows (such as celerity and diffusivity), and the spatial distribution of effective rainfall. Applications were conducted on seven basins located in southern France. First, we study the effects of the spatial discretization of the catchment as a function of morphometric properties, such as the number of source points N, the total length of the channel network T and the mainstream length function M of the drained area S. Relationships are established between N(S), T(S) and M(S) and new descriptors are proposed and correlated with the hydrological properties of the GIUH. Results show that a subdivision of the basin into subcatchments determined by only two main nodes of the channel network is sufficient to identify the GIUH. Second, the sensitivity analysis shows that the GIUH is more sensitive to the channel topology and to the spatial distribution of rainfall when correlated with altitude than it is to the hydraulic properties of flow on hillslopes and in the channel. Numerical simulations enable one to compare the travel time on hillslopes and the travel time through the channel network as a function of the parameters of the GIUH, and to define constraints for basin segmentation in spatially distributed hydrological modelling.

AB The influence of organic carbon content at various flow rates on the transport of aqueous benzene in a sandy soil was investigated. Column experiments were conducted for a sandy soil with different carbon contents (0%, 0.5%, and 2% by weight) and flow rates (0.25, 0.625, and 1.25 ml min(-1)) to observe breakthrough curves of KCl and benzene using a step application. Three types of convection-dispersion transport model (equilibrium, reversible two-site, and reversible-irreversible sorption) were used to determine the appropriate model that best described the observed benzene transport. The modelling results revealed that the reversible-irreversible transport model was suitable for describing the transport and sorption behaviour of benzene in the sandy soil studied. Retardation and irreversible sorption coefficients increased with increasing carbon content, since the increment of carbon content resulted in the enhancement of sorption capacity for benzene. With increasing flow rate, decreased retardation of aqueous benzene was observed due to less reaction time; however, the model parameter for irreversible sorption increased unrealistically. This was attributed to the interference of velocity change on the irreversible sorption coefficient during parameter estimation. In order to avoid this problem, we introduced a Damkohler number (Da(1)), which took into account the velocity changes in estimating the irreversible sorption coefficient. A reasonable relationship was then found between Da(1) and flow rate, which showed a decrease of Da(1) with the increase in flow rate. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Budyko's framework has been widely used to study basin-scale water balance. In this study, we focus on the extended application of Fu's equation (one formulation of the Budyko-type curves) to 371 large irrigation districts in China over a period of 2010-2017. Water balance method was used to estimate actual evapotranspiration ET in the irrigated areas. Considering the contribution of shallow groundwater to ET, the water availability in the Budyko framework defined as equivalent precipitationPe for irrigation areas is the sum of irrigation waterETgw. Results showed that the relationships between evapotranspiration ET0 can be accurately described by the Budyko's curves. The optimal values of Budyko parameter omega for each irrigation district was obtained with multi-annual data using least square method. The Fu's equation performed better in humid and semi-humid regions than arid and semi-arid regions. The comparison between partial differential ET/ partial differential Pe and partial differential ET/ partial differential ET0 confirmed the relative effect of water availability and energy supply on ET according to the variation of climatic conditions. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil properties (denoted by the proportion of clay and sand) were selected to develop empirical equation for parameter omega using multiple linear regression analysis method. This study shows that the Budyko framework can be extended to irrigation areas and provides useful information on evapotranspiration to assist in water management in irrigation areas.

AB As part of an effort to demonstrate the use of climate predictions for water resources management, the El Nio (n) over tilde /Southem Oscillation (ENSO) influences on stream flow in the Kelani River in Sri Lanka were investigated using correlation analysis, composite analysis and contingency tables. El Ni (n) over tildeo (warm phase of ENSO) was associated with decreased annual stream flow and La Ni (n) over tildea (cold phase of ENSO) with increased annual flows. The annual stream flow had a negative correlation with the simultaneous ENSO index of NINO3.4 that was significant at the 95% level. This negative correlation is enhanced to a 99% level if the aggregate January to September or the April to September stream flow alone were considered. Although, there is little correlation between ENSO indices and stream flow during the October to December period, there is a high correlation between rainfall and NINO3.4 (r = 0.51, significant at the 99% level). Therefore ENSO based rainfall predictions can be used along with a hydrological model to predict the October to December stream flow. This study demonstrates the viability of using ENSO based predictors for January to September or April to September stream flow predictions in the Kelani River. The October to December stream flow may be predicted by exploiting the strong relationship between ENSO and rainfall during that period. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The dissipation method, the method preferred for estimating scalar Surface fluxes over open water has not traditionally been used by agronomists, whereas the surface renewal (SR) theory in conj. unction with the analysis of the scalar time trace offers tremendous advantages for estimating fluxes over agronomic crops. For a steady and horizontally homogeneous flow, it is shown that the dissipation method and SR analysis are closely related. As a consequence, a new dissipation-SR analysis expression for estimating scalar surface fluxes was derived. The new equation requires no calibration, and the scalar time trace measured at a frequency capable of identifying canopy-scale coherent structures (typically 4-10 Hz in agriculture) is the only input required. Sensible and latent heat flux estimates obtained from 10 Hz air temperature and water vapour concentration measurements in the inertial sub-layer (2 m height) over short, homogeneous rangeland grass at a site where similarity does not hold gave similar results to those measured with the eddy covariance (EC) method. For unstable cases, the new equation provided a root mean square error of 57 W m(-2) for the surface energy-balance closure. For stable cases, the performance was difficult to evaluate because the EC fluxes were similar in magnitude to the sensor error. It is concluded that the proposed method can contribute to a better understanding of hydrological processes and water requirements by providing an accurate, less costly, alternative method to indirectly estimate evapotranspiration as the residual of the energy balance equation.

AB Organic compounds are removed from the atmosphere and deposited to the Earth's surface via precipitation. In this study, we quantified variations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in precipitation during storm events at the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, a forested watershed in central Pennsylvania (USA). Precipitation samples were collected consecutively throughout the storm during 13 events, which spanned a range of seasons and synoptic meteorological conditions, including a hurricane. Further, we explored factors that affect the temporal variability by considering relationships of DOC in precipitation with atmospheric and storm characteristics. Concentrations and chemical composition of DOC changed considerably during storms, with the magnitude of change within individual events being comparable or higher than the range of variation in average event composition among events. Although some previous studies observed that concentrations of other elements in precipitation typically decrease over the course of individual storm events, results of this study show that DOC concentrations in precipitation are highly variable. During most storm events, concentrations decreased over time, possibly as a result of washing out of the below- cloud atmosphere. However, increasing concentrations that were observed in the later stages of some storm events highlight that DOC removal with precipitation is not merely a dilution response. Increases in DOC during events could result from advection of air masses, local emissions during breaks in precipitation, or chemical transformations in the atmosphere that enhance solubility of organic carbon compounds. This work advances understanding of processes occurring during storms that are relevant to studies of atmospheric chemistry, carbon cycling, and ecosystem responses.

AB Imperviousness, considered as a critical indicator of the hydrologic impacts of urbanization, has gained increasing attention both in the research field and in practice. However, the effectiveness of imperviousness on rainfall-runoff dynamics has not been fully determined in a fine spatiotemporal scale. In this study, 69 drainage subareas <1ha of a typical residential catchment in Beijing were selected to evaluate the hydrologic impacts of imperviousness, under a typical storm event with a 3-year return period. Two metrics, total impervious area (TIA) and effective impervious area (EIA), were identified to represent the impervious characteristics of the selected subareas. Three runoff variables, total runoff depth (TR), peak runoff depth (PR), and lag time (LT), were simulated by using a validated hydrologic model. Regression analyses were developed to explore the quantitative associations between imperviousness and runoff variables. Then, three scenarios were established to test the applicability of the results in considering the different infiltration conditions. Our results showed that runoff variables are significantly related to imperviousness. However, the hydrologic performances of TIA and EIA were scale dependent. Specifically, with finer spatial scale and the condition heavy rainfall, TIA rather than EIA was found to contribute more to TR and PR. EIA tended to have a greater impact on LT and showed a negative relationship. Moreover, the relative significance of TIA and EIA was maintained under the different infiltration conditions. These findings may provide potential implications for landscape and drainage design in urban areas, which help to mitigate the runoff risk. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We coupled the process-based National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model to an urban canopy model and the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System to simulate the effect of urban geometry and anthropogenic exhaustion on the hydrothermal changes in the atmosphere/land and the interfacial areas of the Japanese megalopolis. The simulation was conducted with multiscale in horizontally regional-urban-point levels and in vertically atmospheresurfaceunsaturatedsaturated layers. The model reasonably reproduced the observed hydrothermal values by using ground-truth data in various types of natural/artificial land covers. The simulated results also suggested that the latent heat flux in the new water-holding pavement (consisting of porous asphalt and water-holding filler made of steel by-products based on silica compound) has a strong effect on hydrologic cycle and cooling temperature in comparison with the observed heat budget by newly incorporating the effect of water amount on the heat conductivity in the pavement. Furthermore, the model predicted the hydrothermal changes under two types of land cover scenarios to promote evaporation and to reduce air temperature against heat island phenomenon. Finally, we evaluated the relationship between the effect of groundwater use to ameliorate the heat island and the effect of infiltration on the water cycle in the catchment. These procedures to integrate the multiscaled model simulation with political scenario based on the effective management of water resources as heat sink/source would be very powerful approaches for recovering a sound hydrologic cycle and for creating thermally pleasing environments in the megalopolis.

ID DEUTERIUM EXCESS; FRACTIONATION; O-18
AB Quantitatively assessing the evaporation-caused stable water isotope fractionation in precipitation below the cloud base is of great significance to understand the modern hydrological circulation especially in a plateau climate. Based on the hourly meteorological data at eight meteorological stations of the Gannan Plateau at the eastern margin of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2020, we examined the spatial and temporal variations of below-cloud evaporation effect on precipitation isotopes, and then discussed the factors influencing the below-cloud evaporation across the Gannan Plateau. The contemporary observation of precipitation isotopes at one site in the Gannan Plateau is also applied to understand the local meteoric water line associated with the below-cloud evaporation. From 9:00 to 21:00 Beijing Time, the impact of below-cloud evaporation is greater than that during the rest periods. Within the study region, the below-cloud evaporation in the central area is usually stronger than that of the surrounding area. The diurnal and monthly variability of relative humidity is highly consistent with that of the remaining raindrop mass fraction after evaporation as well as the isotope variation in raindrop below the cloud base. When the relative humidity is greater than 95%, there is a linear relationship between the remaining raindrop mass fraction and the below-cloud deuterium-excess variation of approximate 1.1 parts per thousand/%. Global warming will increase the below-cloud evaporation effect across the Gannan Plateau. The findings are useful to understand the below-cloud evaporation and isotope fractionation under a plateau climate.

AB Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is increasingly used for field soil water estimation because the measurement is non-destructive and less affected by soil texture, bulk density and temperature. However, with the increase in instrument resolution, the influences of soil bulk density and temperature on TDR soil moisture measurements have been reported. The influence is primarily caused by changes in soil and water dielectric permittivity when soil compaction and temperature varies. The objective of this study is to quantify the influence of soil bulk density and temperature, and to provide the corresponding correction methods. Data collected from sand, sandy loam, loam and clay loam show a linear relationship between the square root of dielectric constant of dry soil and bulk density, and a bulk density correction formula has been developed. The dielectric permittivity of soil solids estimated using this formula is close to that of oxides of aluminium, silicon, magnesium and calcium. Data collection from sandy loam show a noticeable decrease in measured soil moisture with increase in temperature when the volumetric soil water content is above 0-30 m(3) m(-3). A temperature-correction equation has been developed, which could provide the corrected soil moisture based on soil temperature and TDR-measured moisture. The effect of clay content has been detected, but it is not statistically significant. High clay contents cause the underestimation of soil water content in the low moisture range and overestimation of soil water content in the high moisture range.

AB The question of which climate model bias correction methods and spatial scales for correction are optimal for both projecting future hydrological changes as well as removing initial model bias has so far received little attention. For 11 climate models (CMs), or GCM/RCM - Global/Regional Climate Model pairing, this paper analyses the relationship between complexity and robustness of three distribution-based scaling (DBS) bias correction methods applied to daily precipitation at various spatial scales. Hydrological simulations are forced by CM inputs to assess the spatial uncertainty of groundwater head and stream discharge given the various DBS methods. A unique metric is devised, which allows for comparison of spatial variability in climate model bias and projected change in precipitation. It is found that the spatial variability in climate model bias is larger than in the climate change signals. The magnitude of spatial bias seen in precipitation inputs does not necessarily correspond to the magnitude of biases seen in hydrological outputs. Variables that integrate basin responses over time and space are more sensitive to mean spatial biases and less so on extremes. Hydrological simulations forced by the least parameterized DBS approach show the highest error in mean and maximum groundwater heads; however, the most highly parameterised DBS approach shows less robustness in future periods compared with the reference period it was trained in. For hydrological impacts studies, choice of bias correction method should depend on the spatial scale at which hydrological impacts variables are required and whether CM initial bias is spatially uniform or spatially varying.

AB Hydrologic balance in high-altitude, mid-latitude mountain areas is important in terms of the water resources available to associated lowlands. This study examined how current and historical shifts in precipitation (P) patterns and concurrent increases in temperature (T) affected runoff (Q) and other hydrologic components in a mid-latitude mountain catchment of central Japan, using a combination of long-term data and a simplified hydrologic model, along with their stochastic treatment. The availability of intensive meteorological and hydrological data from the period 1997-2001 allowed the derivation of key relationships for the Current climate that tie the forcing term to the parameters or state variables. By using the data recorded in the period 1965-2001, the force for driving the historical simulation was generated. Based on this model and historical shifts in P and T, the probability density functions of Q (pdf(Q)) was computed. A main novelty in this study is that such a stochastic representation, which is useful for considering the influence of projected shifts in environmental factors on the hydrologic budget, was provided. Despite the large increase in the rate of T in winter and spring, pdf(Q) in spring and summer varied appreciably during the time studied mainly because of all increase in snowmelt. An interannual change in whole-year Q was robust to shifts in T because while Q in spring increased, in summer it decreased, implying a crucial effect of global warming on mountain hydrologic regimes is change in the timing of Q.

AB Nonlinear dynamics and spatial variability in hydrological systems make the formulation of scaling theories difficult. Therefore, the development of knowledge related to scale effects, scaling techniques, parameterization and linkages of parameters across scales is highly relevant. The main purpose of this work is to analyse the spatial effect of the static storage capacity parameter Hu and the saturated hydraulic conductivity parameter ks from microscale (sub-grid level) to mesoscale (grid level) and its implication to the definition of an optimum cell size. These two parameters describe the upper soil water characteristics in the infiltration process conceptualization of the TETIS hydrological model. At microscale, the spatial heterogeneity of Hu and ks was obtained generating random parameter fields through probability distribution functions and a spatial dependence model with pre-established correlation lengths. The effective parameters at mesoscale were calculated by solving the inverse problem for each parameter field. Results indicate that the adopted inverse formulation allows transferring the nonlinearity of the system from microscale to the mesoscale via non-stationary effective parameters. Their values at each cell and time step are in the range of zero to the mean value of the parameter at microscale. The stochastic simulations showed that the variance of the estimated effective parameters decreases when the ratio between mesoscale cell size and correlation length at microscale increases. For a ratio greater than 1, we found cell sizes having the characteristics of a representative elementary area (REA); in such case, the microscale variability pattern did not affect the system response at mesoscale.

AB Two variates representing either point or spatially-averaged precipitation amounts are governed by a bivariate probability distribution which has a mixed binary-continuous structure built of six elements: three constants and three functions, two univariate and one bivariate. This bivariate distribution is generic to probabilistic analyzing and forecasting of precipitation in space. This article investigates its structure and properties, constructs models of its continuous elements, and validates the models by testing them statistically on 600 pairs of variates, each representing the 24 h precipitation amount at a rain gauge in the Appalachian Mountains.
   The bivariate conditional (on precipitation occurrence at both points) distribution is suitably represented by the meta Gaussian model. Consequently, the bivariate distribution can be constructed from eight elements: four constants and four univariate functions. The three marginal conditional distributions of each variate obey a dominance law uncovered herein through statistical tests. This law is exploited to establish parametric transformations between the marginal conditional distributions. A potential application is demonstrated in real-time forecasting: Given four elements (two probabilities and two marginal conditional distributions) specified by a probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecast (PQPF), and given five climatic parameters, the bivariate distribution of precipitation amounts can be constructed san arbitrary assumptions. Lastly, comparisons are made between the generic bivariate distribution and the bivariate distributions implied by previously published multivariate models of precipitation fields, revealing approximations and flaws imbedded in these models.

AB Though forecasting of river flow has received a great deal of attention from engineers and researchers throughout the world, this still continues to be a challenging task owing to the complexity of the process. In the last decade or so, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely applied, and their ability to model complex phenomena has been clearly demonstrated. However, the success of ANNs depends very crucially on having representative records of sufficient length. Further, the forecast accuracy decreases rapidly with an increase in the forecast horizon. In this study, the use of the Darwinian theory-based recent evolutionary technique of genetic programming (GP) is suggested to forecast fortnightly flow up to 4-lead. It is demonstrated that short lead predictions can be significantly improved from a short and noisy time series if the stochastic (noise) component is appropriately filtered out. The deterministic component can then be easily modelled. Further, only the immediate antecedent exogenous and/or non-exogenous inputs can be assumed to control the process. With an increase in the forecast horizon, the stochastic components also play an important role in the forecast, besides the inherent difficulty in ascertaining the appropriate input variables which can be assumed to govern the underlying process. GP is found to be an efficient tool to identify the most appropriate input variables to achieve reasonable prediction accuracy for higher lead-period forecasts. A comparison with ANNs suggests that though there is no significant difference in the prediction accuracy, GP does offer some unique advantages. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID Q(R)EI(30) INDEX; EROSION
AB Soil erodibilities (K) associated with the EI30 index vary not only with soil properties but also with soil moisture as it varies in time and space. In Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation Version 2 (RUSLE2), temporal variations in soil erodibility in the USA are calculated using monthly precipitation and temperature as independent variables. K-UM, the soil erodibility factor associated with the Q(R)EI(30) index, varies independently of runoff and the product of K-UM and the runoff ratio for the unit plot (Q(R1)) provides an alternative to the temporally varying Ks currently used in predicting storm soil loss in RUSLE2. Comparisons were made between the product of Q(R1) and K-UM and RUSLE2 Ks for representative storms at four locations representing the north to south variation in climate in the USA. Peak erosion associated with the current approach used in RUSLE2 was slightly higher at two locations and slightly lower at the other two locations. One other location, Morris, MN, provided an exception with the peak loss predicted by using the product of Q(R1) and K-UM being 1.7 times that obtained using RUSLE2 Ks. In theory, average annual K-UM values should be better related to soil properties than the average annual values of K frequently used when the average annual values of EI30 are used to predict soil loss. However, work has yet to be performed to determine how K-UM varies directly with soil properties and in space and time. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to obtain the diurnal and seasonal changes of trunk sap flow in desert-living Caragana korshinskii so as to understand its water requirement and ecological significance. The experiment was carried out with 15-year old Caragana korshinskii grown in north-west China under natural conditions. Heat pulse sensors based on the heat compensation theory were applied to measure the trunk sap flow, and soil moisture content at 0-300 cm layer, using tube-type time domain reflectometry (Tube-TDR). The solar radiation, the maximum and minimum air temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction and precipitation were measured at a standard automatic weather station. The diurnal and seasonal variations of sap flow rate, the sap velocity at different positions in the trunk and the sap flow rate under different weather conditions were analysed. And the correlation between the sap flow rate and the meteorological factors was also analysed. Results showed that the trunk sap flow varied regularly in the diurnal term and the sap flow velocity decreased with the probe-inserted depth into the sapwood. Magnitude of sap flow changed considerably between sunny and rainy days. The order of the main meteorological factors affecting the sap flow rate of Caragana korshinskii shrubs were: vapour pressure deficit > solar radiation > air temperature > wind speed. The close correlation between daily sap flow rate and meteorological factors in the whole growing season can be used to estimate the transpiration of Caragana korshinskii.

TI Rainfall network design using kriging and entropy
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES

DE entropy; geostatistics; kriging; rainfall network; spatial uncertainty
AB The spatial distribution of rainfall is related to meteorological and topographical factors. An understanding of the weather and topography is required to select the locations of the rain gauge stations in the catchment to obtain the optimum information. In theory, a well-designed rainfall network can accurately represent and provide the needed information of rainfall in the catchment. However, the available rainfall data are rarely adequate in the mountainous area of Taiwan. In order to provide enough rainfall data to assure the success of water projects, the rainfall network based on the existing rain gauge stations has to be designed.
   A method composed of kriging and entropy that can determine the optimum number and spatial distribution of rain gauge stations in catchments is proposed. Kriging as an interpolator, which performs linear averaging to reconstruct the rainfall over the catchment on the basis of the observed rainfall, is used to compute the spatial variations of rainfall. Thus, the rainfall data at the locations of the candidate rain gauge stations can be reconstructed. The information entropy reveals the rainfall information of the each rain gauge station in the catchment. By calculating the joint entropy and the transmitted information, the candidate rain gauge stations are prioritized. In addition, the saturation of rainfall information can be used to add or remove the rain gauge stations. Thus, the optimum spatial distribution and the minimum number of rain gauge stations in the network can be determined. The catchment of the Shimen Reservoir in Taiwan is used to illustrate the method. The result shows that only seven rain gauge stations are needed to provide the necessary information.

AB The paired watershed experimental (PWE) approach has long been used as an effective means to assess the impacts of forest change on hydrology in small watersheds (<100 km(2)). Yet, the effects of climate variability on streamflow are not often assessed in PWE design. In this study, two sets of paired watersheds, (1) Camp and Greata Creeks and (2) 240 and 241 Creeks located in the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada, were selected to explore relative roles of forest disturbance and climate variability on streamflow components (i.e., baseflow and surface runoff) at different time scales. Our analyses showed that forest disturbance is positively related to annual streamflow components. However, this relationship is statistically insignificant since forest disturbance can either increase or decrease seasonal streamflow components, which eventually limited the positive effect on streamflow at the annual scale. Interestingly, we found that forest disturbance consistently decreased summer streamflow components in the two PWEs as forest disturbance can augment earlier and quicker snow-melt processes and hence reduce soil moisture to maintain summer streamflow components. More importantly, this study revealed that climate variability played a more significant role than forest disturbance in both annual and seasonal streamflow components, for instance, climate variability can account for as much as 90% of summer streamflow components variation in Camp, suggesting the role of climate variability on streamflow should be highlighted in the traditional PWE approach to truly advance our understanding of the interactions of forest change, climate variability and water for sustainable water resource management.

AB Irrigation activities alter water distribution and storage in arid and semi-arid regions worldwide. The removal of water from streams can drastically impact instream flows. However, irrigation water conveyance and application onto fields can create surface and subsurface hydrologic connections, or lateral inflows, that return some of this diverted water back to streams. Prior research has shown the impact of surface water diversions from streams on downstream warming that increases stress on aquatic species. However, the combined effects of flow depletion and irrigation-enhanced lateral inflows on stream temperature and river ecosystems remains poorly studied. To further understand these relationships, we combined intensive field monitoring over three irrigation seasons and thermal aerial imagery to identify irrigation-enhanced subsurface lateral inflow locations and evaluate their effects on stream flow and temperature patterns over a 2.5-km highly depleted study reach. Considering variable hydrology, weather, flow diversions, channel geometry and lateral inflows, we found irrigation-enhanced lateral inflows were the likely explanation for buffered longitudinal and diel warming patterns that prevented stressful or lethal thermal conditions for brown trout. These localized temperature effects were more pronounced in drier years, under high diversion rates and during high solar radiation intensity. We also found that lateral inflows corresponded with greater spatial variability of stream temperatures and potential thermal refugia. Study results illustrate the potential ecological consequences of reducing irrigation-enhanced lateral inflows and highlight the importance of hydrologic monitoring in irrigated arid river valleys. The role and preservation of these lateral inflows should be considered in water resources management related to irrigation efficiency and environmental flows.

AB Understanding and representing hydrologic fluxes in the urban environment is challenging because of fine scale land cover heterogeneity and lack of coherent scaling relationships. Here, the impact of urban land cover heterogeneity, scale, and configuration on the hydrologic and surface energy budget (SEB) is assessed using an integrated, coupled land surface/hydrologic model at high spatial resolutions. Archetypes of urban land cover are simulated at varying resolutions using both the National Land Cover Database (NLCD; 30m) and an ultra high-resolution land cover dataset (0.6m). The analysis shows that the impact of highly organized, yet heterogeneous, land cover typical of the urban domain can cause large variations in hydrologic and energy fluxes within areas of similar land cover. The lateral flow processes that occur within each simulation create variations in overland flow of up to +/- 200% and +/- 4% in evapotranspiration. The impact on the SEB is smaller and largely restricted to the wet season for our semi-arid forcing scenarios. Finally, we find that this seasonal bias, predominantly caused by lateral flow, is displaced by a systematic diurnal bias at coarser resolutions caused by deficiencies in the method used for scaling of land surface and hydrologic parameters. As a result of this research, we have produced land surface parameters for the widely used NLCD urban land cover types. This work illustrates the impact of processes that remain unrepresented in traditional high-resolutions land surface models and how they may affect results and uncertainty in modeling of local water resources and climate.

AB We measured stream temperature continuously during the 2011 summer run-off season (May through October) in nine watersheds of Southeast Alaska that provide spawning habitat for Pacific salmon. The nine watersheds have glacier coverage ranging from 0% to 63%. Our goal was to determine how air temperature and watershed land cover, particularly glacier coverage, influence stream temperature across the seasonal glacial meltwater hydrograph. Multiple linear regression models identified mean watershed elevation (related to glacier extent) and watershed lake coverage (%) as the strongest landscape controls on mean monthly stream temperature, with the weakest (May) and strongest (July) models explaining 86% and 97% of the temperature variability, respectively. Mean weekly stream temperature was significantly correlated with mean weekly air temperature in seven streams; however, the relationships were weak to non-significant in the streams influenced by glacial run-off. Streams with >30% glacier coverage showed decreasing stream temperatures with rising summer air temperatures, whereas those with <30% glacier coverage exhibited summertime warming. Glaciers also had a cooling effect on monthly mean stream temperature during the summer (July through September) equivalent to a decrease of 1.1 degrees C for each 10% increase in glacier coverage. The maximum weekly average temperature (an index of thermal suitability for salmon) in the six glacial streams was substantially below the lower threshold for optimum salmon growth. This finding suggests that although glaciers are important for moderating summer stream temperatures, future reductions in glacier run-off may actually improve the thermal suitability of some glacially dominated streams in Southeast Alaska for salmon.

AB A model-based method is proposed for improving upon existing threshold relationships which define the rainfall conditions for triggering shallow landslides but do not allow the magnitude of landsliding (i.e. the number of landslides) to be determined. The SHETRAN catchment-scale shallow landslide model is used to quantify the magnitude of landsliding as a function of rainfall return period, for focus sites of 180 and 45 km2 in the Italian Southern Alps and the central Spanish Pyrenees. Rainfall events with intensities of different return period are generated for a range of durations (1-day to 5-day) and applied to the model to give the number of landslides triggered and the resulting sediment yield for each event. For a given event duration, simulated numbers of landslides become progressively less sensitive to return period as return period increases. Similarly, for an event of given return period, landslide magnitude becomes less sensitive to event duration as duration increases. The temporal distribution of rainfall within an event is shown to have a significant impact on the number of landslides and the timing of their occurrence. The contribution of shallow landsliding to catchment sediment yield is similarly quantified as a function of the rainfall characteristics. Rainfall intensityduration curves are presented which define different levels of landsliding magnitude and which advance our predictive capability beyond, but are generally consistent with, published threshold curves. The magnitude curves are relevant to the development of guidelines for landslide hazard assessment and forecasting. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Using meteorological data collected in the summer of 1996 and 1997, three evapotranspiration (ET) models, the Penman-Monteith (PM), the modified Penman for non-saturated surface, and the two-source models were applied to estimate hourly ET from different land-use covers of the Paddle River Basin (area = 265 km(2)). By assuming closed canopy conditions, the PM model could estimate the ET of coniferous forest and agricultural land because the contribution of soil evaporation under these land covers is not significant. For mixed forest and pasturelands that are partially vegetated, however, the amount of soil evaporation is significant and so PM underestimated the total ET. The modified Penman model mainly underestimated hourly ET during daytime when the atmosphere is unstable, but overestimated ET during early morning and late afternoon (stable atmosphere), particularly for pastureland. By re-establishing a relationship for the relative evaporation, the ET simulated by the modified Penman model improved. Both PM and the modified Penman are assessed with respect to the comprehensive, two-source model's simulated ET because the latter agrees favourably with the ET obtained from the basin water balance. The water balance ET is reliable because it is based on the streamflow, surface temperature, net radiation and soil moisture simulated by the semi-distributed hydrological model, Semi-distributed Physically based Hydrologic Model-Remote Sensing, DPHM-RS (host to the two-source model), all of which have been demonstrated to agree well with the observed data.

AB This study investigated the effects of clear-cutting and the meteorological and physiological factors on forest evapotranspiration (ET), by using the water-budget method in the Kamabuchi experimental watershed (KMB; 38 degrees 56 ' 21 '' N, 140 degrees 15 ' 58 '' E) in northern Japan. Meteorological and discharge data collected during no-snow periods (from June to October) from 1939 were used to compare ET in three sub-watersheds: No. 1, where the forest had been left undisturbed, and No. 2 and No. 3, where Cryptomeria japonica was planted after clear-cutting. Paired watershed experiments revealed that clear-cutting caused ET to decrease by approximately 100 mm yr(-1), and this reduction continued for more than 20 years, even after C. japonica was planted. ET fluctuated similarly across all watersheds, regardless of clear-cutting or planting. This fluctuation is mainly caused by solar radiation and temperature. Intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) calculated using delta C-13 of tree-ring cellulose in C. japonica increased due to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. We estimated annual carbon fixation in a single tree as the annual net photosynthesis (A). Subsequently, transpiration (E) was calculated from the relationship between iWUE and A. The results showed that A and E per tree increased as the tree grew older; however, the trees' responses to increasing c(a) suppress the increase in ET. Moreover, the fluctuation of ET from the watershed was small compared to the fluctuation of P during the observation periods because the increase and decrease in E and interception loss complemented each other.

AB The hydrological model WATFLOOD and a separate volume-area scaling relationship are applied to estimate glacier wastage and seasonal Melt contribution to the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers originating in the Canadian Rocky Mountains (1975-1998). Wastage is the ice melt volume that exceeds the volume of snow accumulation into the glacier system in a hydrological year, causing an annual net loss of glacier volume. Melt is the ice melt volume that is equal to, or less than, the volume of snow that accumulates into the glacier system in a hydrological year. By our definition then, glacier Melt is a storage term and does not contribute to increased total annual streamflow. Water is stored as snow on accumulation into the glacier system, and the water equivalent runoff is delayed until ice melts in the late summer months of the otherwise low streamflow. Wastage varied between basins with similar glacierized areas reflecting the individual response of glaciers to climate, contributing over 10% to July-to-September streamflow in some headwater basins, but under 3% annually to the regulated flow at Edmonton and Calgary. Melt was positively correlated with basin glacierized area and contributed over 27% to July-to-September flow from basins with greater than 1% glacierized area, and over double the wastage volume at Edmonton and Calgary. Future glacier decline is therefore expected to result mainly in an advancement of peak flow towards a non-glacierized snowmelt regime hydrogaph, resulting in significantly reduced late summer flows further reduced by decreasing wastage contributions.

AB Hyporheic mixing plays a vital role in physical, biogeochemical, and thermal processes in river networks. While many studies have emphasized the role of streambed heterogeneity in hyporheic mixing processes, this study articulates the scale issues inherent in concentration, mixing, heterogeneity, and modeling approaches. It subsequently conducted simulations of hyporheic mixing in synthetic, heterogeneous, 2-D cross-sectional river beds based on prescribed hydraulic conductivity defined at the local-scale. It then investigated the flux variation distribution and the mixing zone under different degrees of heterogeneity and flow scenarios. Since the characterization of the heterogeneities in detail at the local scale is practically impossible, Monte Carlo simulation based on stochastic theory was used to demonstrate the hyporheic mixing under the large-scale control volume (macromixing). Afterward, a first-order stochastic analysis was undertaken to explore the relationship between local-scale flux variance distribution and the mixing zone under different heterogeneity and flow scenarios. The results of this study show that the flux variance in the streambed is an appropriate metric for assessing the magnitude of hyporheic mixing at all scales. Further, surface water velocity and upwelling groundwater are found to be the dominant controlling factors of the flux variance and in turn, the mixing process, followed by the streambed heterogeneity. In addition, it demonstrates that the hyporheic mixing process is significantly affected by the complex surface and groundwater circulation regimes and the stagnation zone under steady-state flow conditions.

AB The dusty gas model constitutive relationships were incorporated into a numerical model for three-phase, multicomponent flow and transport in porous media. The dusty sas model properly accounts for interactions between all gas-phase species in multicomponent gas mixtures. The model also included Knudsen diffusion, which becomes important in very fine grained soils. The dusty gas model results were compared to predictions based on Fick's law. For the cases studied, Fick's law overpredicted flux rates of organic compounds, the effect becoming more pronounced as the permeability of the soil and the Knudsen coefficient were reduced. Increasing moisture content also appeared to increase the difference between predictions based on the dusty gas model and those based on Fick's law. Hypothetical field-scale simulations were performed to show the impact of multicomponent effects and Knudsen diffusion in a sandy soil and in a clay soil. Results showed that remediation times were significantly underpredicted if Fick's law was used for gas-phase diffusion. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.

AB An analytical solution for one-dimensional steady vertical flux through unsaturated homogeneous soils is presented. The model assumes power law hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity functions. The soil domain is a finite-depth flow medium overlying a water table. A steady constant flux is applied at the top boundary while a constant saturation value is specified at the bottom boundary. The general form of the analytical solution expresses implicitly the depth as function of the liquid water saturation. It can be used to model both infiltration through the soil surface and evaporation from the bottom, depending on the sign of the flux boundary value. The analytical solution takes into account the prediction of a drying front in the case of evaporation from deep water table. Algebraic expressions of practical and theoretical importance are derived in terms of soil water parameters. These expressions include the stored mass in the system at steady state as well as the drying front when it exists. The general form solution can be inverted back to obtain exact explicit solutions when the power law parameters are related. Numerical results show the effects of soil type, surface flux, capillarity, and gravity on the saturation distribution in the soil. The analytical solution is used for comparing between models, validating of numerical solutions, as well as for estimating the hydraulic parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Both the inflow and outflow of supra-permafrost water to lakes play important roles in the hydrologic process of thermokarst lakes. The accompanying thermal effects on the adjacent permafrost are required for assessing their influences on the development of thermokarst lakes. For these purposes, the lake water level, temperature dynamics, and supra-permafrost water flow of a lake were monitored on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In addition, the spatial and temporal variation of the active layer thickness and permafrost distribution around the lake were investigated by combining ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography, and borehole temperature monitoring. The results revealed that the yearly unfrozen supra-permafrost water flow around the lake lasted approximately 5 months. The temperature and water level measurements during this period indicate that the lake water was recharged by relatively colder supra-permafrost water from the north-western lakeshore and was discharged through the eastern lakeshore. This process, accompanied by heat exchange with the underlying permafrost, might cause a directional difference of the active layer thickness and permafrost characteristics around the lake. Specifically, the active layer thickness variation was minimal, and the ice-rich permafrost was found adjacent to the lakeshore along the recharge groundwater pathways, whereas a deeper active layer and ice-poor permafrost were observed close to the lakeshore from which the warm lake water was discharged. This study suggests that the lateral flow of warm lake water can be a major driver for the rapid expansion of thermokarst lakes and provides clues for evaluating the relationships between the thermokarst expansion process and climate warming.

AB Depression storage (DS) is the maximum storage of precipitation and runoff in the soil surface at a given slope. The DS is determined by soil roughness that in agricultural soils is largely affected by tillage. The direct measurement of DS is not straightforward because of the natural permeability of the soil. Therefore, DS has generally been estimated from 2D/3D empirical relationships and numerical algorithms based on roughness indexes and height measurements of the soil surface, respectively. The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of some 2D models for DS, using direct and reliable measurements of DS in an agricultural soil as reference values. The study was carried out in experimental microplots where DS was measured in six situations resulting from the combination of three types of tillage carried out parallel and perpendicular to the main slope. Those data were used as reference to evaluate four empirical models and a numerical method. Longitudinal altitudinal profiles of the relief were obtained by a laser profilometer. Infiltration measurements were carried out before and after tillage. The DS was largely affected by tillage and its direction. Highest values of DS are found on rougher surfaces mainly when macroforms cut off the dominant slope. The empirical models had a limited performance while the numerical method was the most effective, even so, with an important variability. In addition, a correct hydrological management should take into account that each type of soil tillage affects infiltration rate differently. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Determining the impact of urbanisation on baseflow is complex because of the multiplicity of factors that govern subsurface flows. Although many metrics are available to quantify the baseflow regime, the lack of consensus on which metrics need to be used for baseflow characterisation limit their practical application for stormwater management. We performed principal component and correlation analyses on a set of 32 baseflow metrics to identify a subset of non-redundant metrics for baseflow characterisation. We compared the results for streamflow time series from natural and urban catchments. We found that a subset of five metrics, including at least one metric from each of the four ecologically significant flow characteristic groups (i.e. magnitude, duration, frequency, and timing), explained most of the variability in baseflow regime for both natural and urban catchments. In addition, we analysed the relationship between this set of metrics and some low flow percentiles obtained from flow duration curves. Flow percentiles were only highly correlated to the magnitude and duration metrics, confirming that flow duration curves could be satisfactorily used for baseflow characterisation, but in combination with metrics representing frequency and timing. Metrics based on integration of the flow duration curve, however, cannot simply substitute the consideration of a suite of metrics. We discuss the practicality of our results with a regional regression study; the analyses show how the metrics can be used to quantify the alterations to baseflow caused by urbanisation, and to determine baseflow restoration objectives for urbanised catchments based on pre-development baseflow regime.

AB Low-relief and highly engineered prairie landscapes present many challenges for water quality modelling. Limited investigation has been carried out to determine whether drains, canals and diversions (artificial waterways) impact water quality relative to natural or naturalized systems or to assess the value of stable water isotopes as predictor variables for specific water quality metrics. The goal of this paper is to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of water chemistry in a typical prairie watershed by (1) comparing water quality and stable water isotopic ratios between naturalized and artificial waterways; (2) evaluating the relationships between topographic and land use characteristics, water quality and stable water isotopic ratios; and (3) expressing and predicting PO4 concentrations as a function of stable water isotopic ratios. Focus was on the 2509km(2) mostly agricultural Seine River Watershed located in southern Manitoba, Canada. Twenty-four sampling sites located along naturalized river reaches, drains and diversions were visited once a week from May to June 2013. Surface water samples were collected and tested for physical water quality parameters and PO4 concentrations, H-2 and O-18. Kruskal-Wallis tests show no significant differences in water chemistry among waterway types, while strong correlations were found between physical water quality parameters, PO4 concentrations, isotopic ratios and watershed characteristics. PO4 concentrations were successfully predicted from isotopic ratios using linear regression models. These results bear significant importance for the mostly ungauged prairie watersheds, thanks to the relative ease and lower cost of measuring stable water isotopic ratios in comparison to nutrient concentrations.

AB For predicting the evolution of solute concentrations in groundwater and testing the impact of remediation policies, a coupling between the agronomical model STICS and the hydrogeological model MODCOU was implemented. When applied to the Seine River basin, this model accurately represents the temporal evolution of average nitrate concentrations in the aquifer, but with large local errors.
   We propose an improvement to the simple unsaturated zone (UZ) scheme NonsatSW used in STICS-MODCOU. The modifications are based on a comparison with the mechanistic model Metis considered as a reference as it solves Richards' equation. A more realistic saturation profile and a varying percolation rate are integrated in NonsatSW. This new model, named NonsatVG, is assessed by comparing it with NonsatSW and Metis. In an ideal case, NonsatVG generates a solute transfer and a dispersion closer to that of Metis than of NonsatSW. In real cases, without additional calibration, NonsatVG and Metis simulate better the average transfer velocities of the observed nitrate profiles.
   Furthermore, modifications in NonsatVG give a direct relationship between the depth of the water table and the saturation profile. We obtain, therefore, as in Metis, an evolution of the solute transfer velocity depending on the piezometric level. These dynamics are not simulated in NonsatSW.
   Despite a modified water transfer through the UZ, NonsatVG is also as valid as NonsatSW in the modelling of water transfer to the saturated zone.
   Finally, an application to the Seine basin shows that solute transfer velocities are lower with NonsatVG than with NonsatSW, but are in better agreement with literature. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   model
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

AB With spatially distributed hydrologic models the need arises for determining the channel cross section shape for the entire stream network. In the absence of cross section data, assumed or parameterized cross section shapes are often used. The effects of parameterized cross sections are evaluated in this study by developing a modeling framework that externally couples a spatially distributed hydrologic model, HL-RDHM, with a one-dimensional unsteady hydraulic model, HEC-RAS. The evaluation emphasizes the effects of parameterized cross sections on simulated flows by focusing the analysis on the portion of the basin's main stream reach where detailed cross section data and observed streamflows (at both ends of the reach) are available, and by developing and testing three cross section scenarios. The scenarios are designed to increase sequentially, in a stepwise fashion, the complexity of the parameterized cross section, starting with a single roughness parameter and channel power law cross section shape and then including additional power law or roughness parameters. This is done stepwise to help distinguish the effects associated with each parameterization, and decide the required level of cross section detail. The scenario simulations are evaluated using split sampling, changes in measures of performance and hydrograph agreement, hypothesis tests on Nash-Sutcliffe values, and overall predictive uncertainty. The coupling framework is applied to the Blue and Illinois River basins, in Oklahoma, US. Overall, we found that in these basins the coupling tends to improve predictions when dynamic wave routing and floodplain cross section geometry are considered concurrently. For this scenario, we found that on average typical measures of model performance may be improved and, based on a quantitative and qualitative assessment, uncertainty may be reduced. We also found that dynamic wave routing does not tend to perform better than kinematic wave routing for the most basic scenarios with a single power law cross section shape. Further, results indicate that the distributed hydrologic model performance at the main outlet and at the upstream boundary of the hydraulic model, and the relative contribution of lateral inflows, are key factors that need to be considered when deciding the applicability of the coupled framework to other basins. In the future, to effectively use resources, it will be beneficial to automate the coupling and accompany its application with a priori criteria for selecting those basins where benefits are most likely.

AB A previous modeling study of the lake-floodplain system of Poyang Lake (China) revealed complex hysteretic relationships between stage, storage volume and surface area. However, only hypothetical causal factors were presented, and the reasons for the occurrence of both clockwise and counterclockwise hysteretic functions were unclear. The current study aims to address this by exploring further Poyang Lake's hysteretic behavior, including consideration of stage-flow relationships. Remotely sensed imagery is used to validate the water surface areas produced by hydrodynamic modeling. Stage-area relationships obtained using the two methods are in strong agreement. The new results reveal a three-phase hydrological regime in stage-flow relationships, which assists in developing improved physical interpretation of hysteretic stage-area relationships for the lake-floodplain system. For stage-area relationships, clockwise hysteresis is the result of classic floodplain hysteretic processes (e.g., restricted drainage of the floodplain during recession), whereas counterclockwise hysteresis derives from the river hysteresis effect (i.e., caused by backwater effects). The river hysteresis effect is enhanced by the time lag between the peaks of catchment inflow and Yangtze discharge (i.e., the so-called Yangtze River blocking effect). The time lag also leads to clockwise hysteresis in the relationship between Yangtze River discharge and lake stage. Thus, factors leading to hysteresis in other rivers, lakes and floodplains act in combination within Poyang Lake to create spatial variability in hydrological hysteresis. These effects dominate at different times, in different parts of the lake, and during different phases of the lake's water level fluctuations, creating the unique hysteretic hydrological behavior of Poyang Lake.

AB We propose in this paper a regional formulation of Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves of point-rainfall maxima in a scale-invariant Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) framework. The two assumptions we make is that extreme daily rainfall is GEV-distributed - which is justified by Extreme Value Theory (EVT) - and that extremes of aggregated daily rainfall follow simple-scaling relationships. Following these assumptions, we develop in a unified way a GEV simple-scaling model for extremes of aggregated daily rainfall over the range of durations where scaling applies. Then we propose a way of correcting this model for measurement frequency, giving a new GEV-scaling model for extremes of aggregated hourly rainfall. This model deviates from the simple-scaling assumption. This framework is applied to the Mediterranean region of Cevennes-Vivarais, France. A network of about 300 daily raingage stations covering the last 50 years and accumulated to span the range 1 day-1 week is used to fit the scale invariant GEV-model locally. By means of spatial interpolation of the model parameters, and correction for measurement frequency, we are able to build a regional model with good performances down to 1 h duration, even though only one hourly station is used to build the model. Finally we produce mean and return level maps within the region in the range 1 h-1 week and comment on the potential rain storms leading to these maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Non-contact flow measurement method plays an increasingly important role in river discharge measurement. However, most channel cross-section velocity distribution models proposed by researchers have certain limitations in application, underwater velocities are always necessary when applied in narrow channels, which makes it challenging to calculate natural river discharge using water-surface velocities measured by remote sensing instruments. This letter takes water-surface velocities detected by UHF radar as boundary conditions and a new velocity distribution model is derived based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (BANS) equations. UHF radar measures surface velocities of the cross-section, and velocities on the river bed of the cross-section are considered to be 0. The BANS equations are simplified to be a two-dimensional Poisson equation and the cross-section velocity distribution is solved by using the closed boundary conditions. Some field experiments were conducted in the Hanjiang River at Xiantao, Hubei, China in September 2017 and April July 2018, the processing results of which show that the proposed model is superior to the power law and the log law models, especially near the side wall (narrow channel region). River discharges calculated by this method are highly consistent with those provided by Hubei Xiantao hydrologic station, which verifies the reliability of the model and the feasibility of using UHF radar to measure natural river discharge continuously and automatically.

AB Distributions of daily average water levels prior to ice-jams and in jam-free periods during spring breakups in the Lena river were constructed. The results showed that during periods of water rising in jam-free years, water levels were distributed in a random manner, in accordance with an exponential (Poisson-like) function. In contrast, water-level distributions during periods preceding ice-jams followed a power law similar to various multiscale hydrological phenomena, such as flood occurrences, return periods of rainfall, Arctic drifting-ice dynamics, and other nonequilibrium natural processes. However, the complexity of ice-jam floods is of a particular kind. In many cases, the power exponent in a water-level distribution (referred to as the b-value in a Gutenberg-Richter relation) increased sharply a few days before an ice-jam. In other words, a plot of the entire power-law distribution usually consists of two portions, differing in their slope. In terms of thermodynamics, an increase of the b-value leads to a decrease of the system conservation. To explain this effect, one should take into account that ice-jams are frequently preceded by advances of ice, which changes the energy balance in the water-ice system. As a result, the power exponent in water-level distributions appears to be higher in the partially fragmented ice cover.

AB The statistical properties of annual runoff in major rivers of China are studied based on the theory of stochastic process and technology of time series analysis. These properties include the characteristics of intra-annual and inter-annual variations of runoff, trends, abrupt changes and periodicities. The new findings from the intensive calculations and appropriate analysis of data in longer period are as follows: (i) compared with the nonuniformity of intra-annual runoff before 1980, the nonuniformity of intra-annual runoff in China generally decreased after 1980, except for Huaihe River and Songhua River; (ii) compared with the annual runoff before 1980, the annual runoff in China generally decreased after 1980 except for WangJiaba station in Huaihe River and Ha-Erbin station in Songhua River; the frequency of continuous low flow and continuous high flow in Haihe River and the downstream of Yellow River is higher than those in other rivers in China; (iii) annual runoff shows a downward trend in major rivers of China especially in Haihe River, Liao River and the midstream and downstream of Yellow River; (iv) there exist certain abrupt changes of annual runoff in major rivers of China; the abrupt change-points are different among different river basins; and (v) almost periodicities of annual runoff sequences in major rivers of China are generally 20 years below, that is, 3-7 and 12-20 years. The reasons for these changes are mainly caused by climate change and human activities. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI OPTIMAL SOIL VENTING DESIGN USING BAYESIAN DECISION-ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION
AB Remediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated sites can be costly and the design process becomes complex in the presence of parameter uncertainty. Classical decision theory related to remediation design requires the parameter uncertainties to be stipulated in terms of statistical estimates based on site observations. In the absence of detailed data on parameter uncertainty, classical decision theory provides little contribution in designing a risk-based optimal design strategy. Bayesian decision theory, however, allows the use of subjective judgments of the designer together with parameter uncertainty in the decision-making process. In the present work, Bayesian theory is used in developing the theoretical framework for risk-based design analysis for soil gas venting operations. Two utility functions, exponential and quadratic, were used in the analysis, identifying the cost, and risk associated with under- or over-achieving the site stipulated remediation targets. Preposterior analysis provided the information on estimated optimal venting time, optimal effective how rate and sample size for both utility functions, and the applicability of each function. Hypothetical field-scale simulations using normal and weathered gasoline were performed to demonstrate the applicability of Bayesian decision theory based analysis for practical scale problems.

AB Quantification of the relationships between snow and forest cover, including its removal through logging, insects or disease and its regrowth, is a prerequisite to assessing the effects of forestry practices on streamflow from montane and boreal forest watersheds. Over a 3 year period, a juvenile and a juvenile-thinned lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) stand, a mature mixed Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt) and lodgepole pine stand, and a clearcut were intensively surveyed to quantify differences in snow water equivalent (SWE). Daily snowmelt, weather conditions, and the energy balance were measured during the first year of this study. The 1 April SWE was 32% and 14% less under the mature and juvenile forests respectively than in the clearcut. No significant differences in peak SWE were measured between the juvenile and juvenile-thinned stands. Continuous snowmelt lysimeter measurements showed that snowmelt began earlier, accumulated more rapidly, and disappeared 2 to 4 days earlier in the juvenile-thinned stand than in either the unthinned juvenile stand or the clearcut. When the snowpack had disappeared from the clearcut and juvenile stands, 30% of the SWE on I April remained in the mature forest. The results not only show that snow accumulation and melt differ significantly between clearcut, juvenile, and mature stands, but also that snowmelt patterns vary among juvenile stands with distinct structural differences. This is due to the difference in the energy balances, dominated by radiant heat fluxes, of the four sites. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Cold areas commonly experienced freeze-thaw cycles and covered with rock fragment. Exploring sediment transport capacity of frozen-stony soil scoured by concentrated meltwater flow is meaningful for soil erosion prediction and modelling in cold regions. This laboratory experiment is conducted to evaluate the contribution of frozen layer and rock fragment to soil erosion, which involves three slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees, three flow rates of 1, 2, and 4 L min(-1), four thawed soil depths of 1, 2, 5, and 10 cm, and four rock fragment contents of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 50% on mass basis with rill length of 12 m. Sediment concentration was determined by the soil in runoff at the outlet. An equation is proposed to estimate sediment transport capacity affected by thawed soil depth and rock fragment content by combining exponential and quadratic functions. Model-fitting results show that sediment transport capacity is negatively correlated with thawed soil depth and exhibits quadratic relationship with rock fragment which peaks at 20% and significantly decreases at rock fragment of 50% on partially thawed slope. Rock fragment takes the leading role of soil erosion on frozen-stony slope instead of thawed soil depth. Results also indicate that embedded rock fragment on totally thawed soil presents more apparently positive impact at low content, but offers more protection at high content on partially frozen layer. This research reveals the soil erosion mechanisms on frozen-stony slope and gives guidance for soil conservation in similar hydrologic conditions and soil type.

AB An extensive dataset (230 precipitation gauges and 79 stream gauges) was used to analyse rainfall-runoff relationships in 10 subregions of a 482000 km(2) area in the south-eastern USA (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia). The average annual rainfall and runoff for this study area between 1938 and 2005 were 1201 and 439 mm, respectively. Average runoff/rainfall ratios during this period varied between 0.24 in the southern most Coastal Plain subregion to 0.64 in the Blue Rid-e Province. Watershed elevation and relief are the principal determinants governing the conversion of rainfall to runoff. Temporal rainfall variation throughout the south-eastern USA ranges from similar to 40% above and below normal while the variation for runoff is higher, from -75% to +100%. In any given year there can exist a +/- 25-50% error in predicted runoff deviation using the annual rainfall-runoff regression. Fast Fourier Transform and autoregressive spectral analysis revealed dominant cyclicities for rainfall and runoff between 14 and 17 years. Secondary periodicities were typically between 6-7 and 10-12 years. The inferred cyclicity may be related to ENSO and/or Central North Pacific atmospheric phenomena. Mann-Kendall analyses indicate that there were no consistent statistically significant temporal trends with respect to Southeastern US rainfall and runoff during the Study period. The results of U-tests similarly indicated that rainfall between 1996 and 2005 was not statistically higher or lower than during earlier in the Study period.

AB The confounding effects of step change invalidate the stationarity assumption of commonly used trend analysis methods such as the Mann-Kendall test technique, so previous studies have failed to explain inconsistencies between detected trends and observed large precipitation anomalies. The objectives of this study were to (1) formulate a trend analysis approach that considers nonstationarity due to step changes, (2) use this approach to detect trends and extreme occurrences of precipitation in a mid-latitude Eurasian steppe watershed in North China, and (3) examine how runoff responds to precipitation trends in the study watershed. Our results indicate that annual precipitation underwent a marginal step jump around 1995. The significant annual downward trend after 1994 was primarily due to a decrease in summer rainfall; other seasons exhibited no significant precipitation trends. At a monthly scale, July rainfall after 1994 exhibited a significant downward trend, whereas precipitation in other months had no trend. The percentage of wet days also underwent a step jump around 1994 following a significant decreasing trend, although the precipitation intensity exhibited neither a step change nor any significant trend. However, both low-frequency and high-frequency precipitation events in the study watershed occurred more often after than before 1994; probably as either a result or an indicator of climate change. In response to these precipitation changes, the study watershed had distinctly different precipitation-runoff relationships for observed annual precipitations of less than 300 mm, between 300 and 400 mm, and greater than 400 mm.

AB Analogue models of reservoirs were developed based on the analysis of measured discharge from two karstic springs. The first spring is characterized by linearity between the flow and time; the second by a power law between flow and time. In the two studied cases, the reservoirs are nonlinear, according to the view point of linearity between stored volume and the flow at the same moment. The analogue models developed consist of a vertical relationship in a series of reservoirs. For the first spring, the reservoirs are entirely vertical wall reservoirs. The second spring consists of a vertical wall reservoir and a reservoir for which the geometry of the walls follows a non integer power law. The plausibility and the reproducibility of the analogue models were validated according to the available data. It was shown that the case of linear reservoirs in a karstic medium is a very particular one, corresponding to a hyperbolic reservoir or to a vertical wall reservoir with porous filter.

AB Flood generation is triggered by the interaction of the hydrological pre-conditions and the meteorological conditions at different space-time scales. This interaction results in floods of diverse characteristics, e.g. spatial flood extent and temporal flood progression. While previous studies have either linked flood occurrence to weather patterns neglecting the hydrological pre-conditions or categorised floods according to their generating mechanisms into flood types, this study combines both approaches. Exemplary for the Elbe River basin, the influence of pre-event soil moisture as an indicator of hydrological pre-conditions, on the link between weather patterns and flood occurrence is investigated. Flood favouring soil moisture and weather patterns as well as their combined influence on flood occurrence are examined. Flood types are identified and linked to soil moisture and weather patterns. The results show that the flood favouring hydro-meteorological patterns vary between seasons and can be linked to flood types. The highest flood potential for long-rain floods is associated with a weather pattern that is often identified in the presence of so called 'Vb' cyclones. Rain-on-snow and snowmelt floods are associated with westerly and north-westerly wind directions. In the analysis period, 18% of weather patterns only caused flooding in case of preceding soil saturation. The presented concept is part of a paradigm shift from pure flood frequency analysis to a frequency analysis that bases itself on process understanding by describing flood occurrence and characteristics in dependence of hydro-meteorological patterns.

AB Floodplains are vital components of river ecosystems and play an important role in carbon cycling and storage at catchment and global scales. For efficient river management and conservation, it is critical to understand the functional role of spatiotemporally complex and dynamic habitat mosaics of river floodplains. Unfortunately, the fundamental understanding of mineralization and carbon flux patterns across complex floodplains is still fragmentary. In this study, respiratory potential (i.e., electron transport system activity [ETSA]) was quantified seasonally across different aquatic and terrestrial habitats (wetted channels, gravel bars, islands, riparian forests, and grasslands) of 2 Alpine floodplains differing in climate, altitude, discharge, flow alteration intensity, and land use (Soca [natural flow regime, 12% grassland area] and Urbach [mean annual discharge reduction by 30% due to water abstraction, 69% grassland area]). In situ respiration (R) was measured, and ETSA-R ratios were calculated to examine differences in exploitation intensity of the overall respiratory capacity among floodplain habitats and seasons. ETSA and R provided potential and actual estimates, respectively, of organic matter mineralization in the different floodplain habitats. Hierarchical linear regression across habitat types showed that organic matter, grain sizes <0.063 mm, and water content were the most important predictors of ETSA in both floodplains, and grain sizes 2-0.063 and >8mm were also highly important for the Soca floodplain. The combination of ETSA and R measurements conducted in contrasting floodplains increased our understanding of the relationships between floodplain habitat heterogeneity, organic matter mineralization and human impacts, that is, structural-functional linkages in floodplains. These data are integral towards predicting changes in floodplain function in response to environmental alterations from increasing human pressures and environmental change.

AB Timber harvest temporarily increases water yield; however, relationships between hydrologic and nutrient chemistry changes have not been consistent. This study quantified the effects of forest harvesting and site preparation without fertilization and with modern best management practices on nutrient concentrations and yields in small headwater streams of the Southeastern Coastal Plain. We monitored two watershed pairs for 2years prior to and 1year following timber harvest and for 2 more years following site preparation and planting. Treatment watersheds were clearcut, and downstream portions of streamside management zones were thinned in Fall 2003. Site preparation (herbicide application and burning) and planting followed a year later. All operations followed 1999 Georgia forestry best management practices. Previously published research revealed a large increase in water yield following harvest. Nutrient concentrations varied significantly within and between monitoring periods, even in reference watersheds. Silvicultural activities had no discernible effect on phosphorus and ammonium concentrations; however, statistically significant increases in nitrate/nitrite (67-340 mu gL(-1)) and total nitrogen concentrations (100-400 mu gL(-1)) in treatment watersheds followed stand re-establishment. Nutrient yields increased after timber harvest largely as a result of increased water yields, although increased nutrient yields were small relative to inter-annual and inter-watershed variability and variability. Annual water yield largely explained the variability in annual nitrogen and phosphorus export from reference and treatment streams (r(2) values from 0.65 to 0.98). High NOx concentrations coming from an upstream agricultural area decreased 1600-1800 mu gL(-1) over several hundred metres in the treatment streams by dilution, uptake or denitrification.

AB Relationships between stream chemistry and elevation, area, Anakeesta geology, soil properties, and dominant vegetation were evaluated to identify the influence of basin characteristics on baseflow and stormflow chemistry in eight streams of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Statistical analyses were employed to determine differences between baseflow and stormflow chemistry, and relate basin-scale factors governing local chemical processes to stream chemistry. Following precipitation events, stream pH was reduced and aluminium concentrations increased, while the response of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), nitrate, sulfate, and base cations varied. Several basin characteristics were highly correlated with each other, demonstrating the interrelatedness of topographical, geological, soil, and vegetative parameters. These interrelated basin factors uniquely influenced acidification response in these streams. Streams in higher-elevation basins (>975m) had significantly lower pH, ANC, sodium, and silicon and higher nitrate concentrations (p<0.05). Streams in smaller basins (<10km(2)) had significantly lower nitrate, sodium, magnesium, silicon, and base cation concentrations. In stormflow, streams in basins with Anakeesta geology (>10%) had significantly lower pH and sodium concentrations, and higher aluminium concentrations. Chemical and physical soil characteristics and dominant overstory vegetation in basins were more strongly correlated with baseflow and stormflow chemical constituents than topographical and geological basin factors. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, of all the soil parameters, was most related to concentrations of stormflow constituents. Basins with higher average hydraulic conductivities were associated with lower stream pH, ANC, and base cation concentrations, and higher nitrate and sulfate concentrations. These results emphasize the importance of soil and geological properties influencing stream chemistry and promote the prioritization of management strategies for aquatic resources.

AB Many civil infrastructures are located near the confluence of two streams, where they may be Subject to inundation by high flows from either stream or both. These infrastructures, Such as highway bridges, are designed to meet specified performance objectives for flood, of a specified return period (e.g. the 100 year flood). Because the flooding of structures on one stream can be affected by high flows on the other stream, it is important to know the relationship between the coincident exceedence probabilities on the confluent stream pair in many hydrological engineering practices. Currently, the National Flood Frequency Program (NFF), which was developed by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and based on regional analysis, is probably the most popular model for ungauged site flood estimation and could be employed to estimate flood probabilities at the confluence points. The need for improved infrastructure design at such sites has motivated a renewed interest in the development of more rigorous joint probability distributions of the coincident flows. To accomplish this, a practical procedure is needed to determine the crucial bivariate distributions of design flows at stream confluences. In the past, the Copula method provided a way to construct multivariate distribution functions. This paper aims to develop the Copula-based Flood Frequency (COFF) method at the confluence points with any type of marginal distributions via the use of Archimedean copulas and dependent parameters. The practical implementation was assessed and tested against the standard NFF approach by a case study in Iowa's Des Moines River. Monte Carlo simulations proved the success of the generalized copula-based joint distribution algorithm. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this study, a new approach is developed to simulate groundwater flow through both an overlying unconfined aquifer and an underlying discrete fracture network. The groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network, including magnitude and direction, is explicitly simulated based on the mass conservation, which depends on a variety of parameters related to flow and network characteristics. In the overlying unconfined aquifer, we approximate the flow using the Dupuit assumptions. In the underlying fracture network, we use the cubic law and Forchheimer's law to iteratively simulate laminar or turbulent flow in individual fractures depending on the Reynolds number. Explicitly separating laminar and turbulent flows in the fractures results in a system of nonlinear equations, which is iteratively solved. While the flow from the overlying unconfined aquifer is a small portion of the overall flow in the underlying fracture network, incorrect use of the laminar or turbulent flow equation in the fractures can lead to significant errors in simulating the flow exchange. As apertures increase, both the portion of the total flowrate in the aquifer and the portion of the flow in the fractures coming from the aquifer decrease. As the overall hydraulic gradient increases, both the portion of the total flow in the aquifer and the portion of the fracture flow that comes from the aquifer increase. The portion of the total flow in the aquifer increases with the aquifer thickness, while the portion of fracture flow coming from the overlying aquifer decreases.

AB Non-Darcian flow towards a well which fully penetrates a confined single vertical fracture is presented in this paper on the basis of the Izbash equation. We have obtained semi-analytical solutions for non-Darcian flow by using the Boltzmann transform and developed the non-Darcian flow welt functions for cases with and without the effect of wellbore storage. The results show that the non-Darcian flow type curves are more or less deviated from the Darcian flow type curve. The non-linear effect is mainly attributable to the turbulent factor, v, a dimensionless parameter related to the pumping rate, the fracture aperture, the fracture thickness, and two constants k' and n used in the Izbash power-law. The non-Linear effect appears to be less sensitive to the power-law index, n. When excluding wellbore storage, the well function at early times is proportional to v(-1/(n-1))u(-n/(n-1)), where u is a dimensionless term inversely proportional to time; whereas the well function at late times is approximated as v/root(n-1)uv [2 + A(0)(n)], where A(0)(n) is a finite term depending on n. When considering wellbore as storage, drawdowns inside the well with different v values approach the same asymptotic value at small times, and the effect of wellbore storage is only found at the early stage of pumping.

AB Provision of reliable scientific support to socio-economic development and eco-environmental conservation is challenged by complexities of irregular nonlinearities, data uncertainties, and multivariate dependencies of hydrological systems in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region, China. Among them, the irregular nonlinearities mainly represent unreliability of regular functions for robust simulation of highly complicated relationships between variables. Based on the proposed discrete principal-monotonicity inference (DPMI) approach, streamflow generation in the Xingshan Watershed, a representative watershed in this region, is examined. Based on system characterization, predictor identification, and streamflow distribution transformation, DPMI parameters are calibrated through a two-stage strategy. Results indicate that the modelling efficiency of DPMI is satisfactory for streamflow simulation under these complexities. The distribution transformation method and the two-stage calibration strategy can deal with non-normality of streamflow and temporally unstable accuracy of hydrological models, respectively. The DPMI process and results reveal that both streamflow uncertainty and its rising tendency increase with flow levels. The dominant driving forces of streamflow generation are daily lowest temperature and daily cumulative precipitation in consideration of performances in global and local scales. The temporal heterogeneity of local significances to streamflow is insignificant for meteorological conditions. There is significant nonlinearity between meteorological conditions and streamflow and dependencies among meteorological conditions. The generation mechanism of low flows is more complicated than medium flows and high flows. The DPMI approach can facilitate improving robustness of hydro-system analysis studies in the Xingshan Watershed or the TGR region. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The Ischia hydrothermal system was analysed through hydrogeological and microbial community investigations. Mesophilic communities were detected in two cold springs, suggesting a negligible influence of thermal circuits in freshwater sub-systems which are mainly or only fed by local precipitations. Thermophilic and extremely thermophilic bacteria were detected in two wells, according to higher water temperatures (61 and 85 degrees C), even if the two communities show significant differences. In one well, thermophilic and extremely thermophilic bacteria are associated with strains belonging to epsilon-Proteobacteria isolated in different sulphur-rich carbonate environments. This association suggests a greater influence on ascending hot fluids that interact with the carbonate basement of volcanic rocks. In the other well, thermophilic and extremely thermophilic bacteria are associated with strains isolated in cold hypersaline environments or in aquatic habitats where terrestrial and marine components are coupled. This association supports the fact that seawater intrusion can affect this part of Ischia, according to results of hydrogeological and geochemical surveys. Differences in groundwater temperature and bacterial communities are probably mainly due to differences in permeability between volcanic rocks and differences in hydrogeologic behaviour between faults in the upper carbonate basement, above the deep magma chamber, that influence relationships between ascending hot fluids and local recharge. This study contributes to discussion of the reliability of the actual behaviour models of the Ischia system, based on the results of geochemical and isotopic investigations, and, in a wider context, it shows that microbial community investigations may be a valuable supplementary tool for analysing hydrothermal system behaviour.

AB Flow pathways were examined using both hydrometric observations and geochemical tracers in a 4.9 ha nested Japanese cypress watershed. Hydrometric observations on hillslopes showed measurably significant amounts of overland flow for all types of hillslopes, regardless of the condition of the understorey vegetation. The relationships between small and large plots suggested that all overland flows generated on hillslopes were not transferred to the channels. Storm water chemistry was sampled for storm events with total precipitation >80 mm. On the basis of the final mixing analysis, K+ was used to separate overland flow from other components. The sizes of storm events did not affect the patterns of the flow components separated by delta O-18 (new water) and K+ (reacted water). On the basis of the hydrograph separation by delta O-18, small catchments tended to have smaller old water components regardless of vegetation type, which agreed with the ephemeral nature of flow conditions in these small catchments. Hence, old and new water ratios between small and large catchments were found to vary greatly among storm events. Overland flow contributed up to 30% of storm runoff in specific small catchments with sparse understorey vegetation, whereas overland flow contribution attributed to 1-2% in catchments with fern and shrub vegetation cover. The contributions of overland flow on catchment runoff decreased with increases in the drainage area. The combination of both hydrometric observations and geochemical tracers can facilitate the understanding of the links between hillslopes and streams related to overland flow and material dynamics.

AB The efficacy of in-stream nephelometric turbidometry as a surrogate for total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations was evaluated for use in low turbidity (< 50 NTU) subalpine watersheds at Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada, USA. Continuous turbidity records for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 snowmelt seasons and data from water quality samples (1982-2000) were examined to determine watershed sediment delivery dynamics. Strong correlations were found between turbidity and both TSS and TP concentration. The strong con-elation indicates that turbidity can serve as a good surrogate for direct measurement in these watersheds. The watersheds displayed clockwise hysteresis: sediment flushing and depletion, on daily, seasonal and decadal time-scales. The hysteresis curves had strong concave shapes, indicating a sensitive response to peak flow. A pronounced seasonal trend was observed for the ratio of suspended sediment concentration (SSC)/discharge over time, indicating early season flushing of available sediment. Significant linear relationships (p < 0.05) were found for 12 of 17 years. Comparison of annual sediment rating curve coefficients indicated smaller coefficients during high sediment loading years and in the years following. The smaller coefficients are evidence of sediment depletion during high flow years. The effect of hysteresis on monitoring methods was illustrated by comparing turbidity estimates of TSS load with sediment rating curve estimates of SSC. After accounting for differences in SSC/TSS methods of analysis, daily loads calculated with turbidity methods were 58-98% of rating curve estimates for the spring snowmelt seasons of 1999-2001.

AB Understanding recharge mechanisms and controls in karst regions is extremely important for managing water resources because of the dynamic nature of the system. The objective of this study was to evaluate water percolation through epikarst by monitoring water flow into a cave and conducting artificial irrigation and tracer experiments, at Sif Cave in Wadi Sussi, Israel from 2005 through 2007.
   The research is based on continuous high-resolution direct measurements of both rainfall and water percolation in the cave chamber collected by three large PVC sheets which integrate drips from three different areas (17, 46, and 52 m(2)). Barrels equipped with pressure transducers record drip rate and volume for each of the three areas. The combined measured rainfall and cave data enables estimation of recharge into the epikarst and to better understand the relationship of rainfall-recharge. Three distinct types of flow regimes were identified: (1) 'Quick flow' through preferential flow paths (large fractures and conduits); (2) 'Intermediate flow' through a secondary crack system; and (3) 'Slow flow' through the matrix. A threshold of similar to 100 mm of rain at the beginning of the rainy season is required to increase soil water content allowing later rainfall events to percolate deeper through the soil and to initiate dripping in the cave. During winter, as the soil water content rises, the lag time between a rain event and cave drip response decreases. Annual recharge (140-160 mm in different areas in the cave) measured represents 30-35% of annual rainfall (460 mm). Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Rivers in the Mediterranean region often exhibit an intermittent character. An understanding and classification of the flow regimes of these rivers is needed, as flow patterns control both physicochemical and biological processes. This paper reports an attempt to classify flow regimes in Mediterranean rivers based on hydrological variables extracted from discharge time series. Long-term discharge records from 60 rivers within the Mediterranean region were analysed in order to classify the streams into different flow regime groups. Hydrological indices (HIs) were derived for each stream and principal component analysis (PCA) and then applied to these indices to identify subsets of HIs describing the major sources of variations, while simultaneously minimizing redundancy. PCA was performed for two groups of streams (perennial and temporary) and for all streams combined. The results show that whereas perennial streams are mainly described by high-flow indices, temporary streams are described by duration, variability and predictability indices. Agglomerative cluster analysis based on HIs identified six groups of rivers classified according to differences in intermittency and variability. A methodology allowing such a classification for ungauged catchments was also tested. Broad-scale catchment characteristics based on digital elevation, climate, soil and land use data were derived for each long-term station where these data were available. By using stepwise multiple regression analysis, statistically significant relationships were fitted, linking the three selected hydrological variables (mean annual number of zero-flow days, predictability and flashiness) to the catchment characteristics. The method provides a means of simplifying the complexity of river systems and is thus useful for river basin management. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Water erosion on hillslopes is a worldwide environmental problem, which is a rainfall-induced process, especially extreme rainfall. The great intensity of extreme rainfall strongly enhances the power of overland flow to detach soil and transport sediment. Plant litter is one of the most important constituents of ecosystems that often covers the soil surface and can be incorporated into topsoil. However, little attention has been paid to its effect on flow hydraulics owing to the veiled nature. This study aimed to examine the effects of incorporated litter on the hydraulic properties under extreme rainfall condition. To reach this goal, six litter rates of 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.35, and 0.50 kg m(-2) and four litter types collected from deciduous trees, coniferous trees, shrubs, and herbs were incorporated into topsoil. Then, simulated rainfall experiments were performed on five slope gradients (5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, and 25 degrees) with an extreme rainfall intensity of 80 mm h(-1). The results showed that Froude number and flow velocity of the overland flow decreased, whereas flow resistance increased exponentially with litter incorporation rate. Litter type had an influence on flow hydraulics, which can mainly be attributed to the variations in surface coverage of the exposed litter and the litter morphology. Flow velocity and Darcy-Weisbach coefficient increased markedly with slope gradient. However, the variation of slope gradient did not modify the relationships between flow hydraulics and incorporated litter rate. The random roughness, resulting from heterogeneous erosion due to the uneven protection of surface exposed litter, increased linearly with litter incorporated rate. As rainfall proceeded, flow hydraulics varied with incorporated litter rate and slope gradient complicatedly due to the increases in flow rate and coverage of the exposed litter and the modification of soil surface roughness.

AB Global peatlands store an unparalleled proportion of total global organic carbon but it is vulnerable to erosion into fluvial systems. Fluvial networks are being recognized as areas of carbon transformation, with eroded particulate organic carbon processed to dissolved organic carbon and CO2. Existing studies indicate biodegradation and photodegradation as key processes controlling the transformation of organic carbon in fluvial systems, with initial concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) identified as a control on the rate of carbon mineralization. This study manipulates temperature and incident light intensity to investigate carbon mineralization rates in laboratory simulations of peatland sediment transport into fluvial systems. By directly measuring gaseous CO2 emissions from sampled stream water, the relationship of temperature and light intensity with carbon efflux is identified. In simulations where sediment (as particulate organic matter, POM) is absent, temperature is consistently the dominant factor influencing carbon efflux rates. This influence is independent of the initial DOC concentration of the water sample. In simulations where POM was added, representing a peatland river receiving eroded terrestrial sediment, initial DOC concentration predicts 79% of the variation in total gaseous carbon efflux whereas temperature and light intensity predict 12% and 3%, respectively. When sampled stream water's mineralization rates in the presence of added POM are analysed independently, removing DOC as a model variable, the dominant variable affecting CO2 efflux is opposite for each sample. This study presents novel data suggesting peatland erosion introduces further complexity to dynamic stream systems where rates of carbon transformation processes and the influence of specific environmental variables are interdependent. Anthropogenic climate change is identified as a leading risk factor perpetuating peatland erosion; therefore, understanding the fate of terrestrial sediment in rivers and further quantifying the benefits of protecting peatland soils will be of increasing importance to carbon budgeting and ecosystem function studies.

AB Critical zone influences on hydrologic partitioning, subsurface flow paths and reactions along these flow paths dictate the timing and magnitude of groundwater and solute flux to streams. To isolate first-order controls on seasonal streamflow generation within highly heterogeneous, snow-dominated basins of the Colorado River, we employ a multivariate statistical approach of end-member mixing analysis using a suite of daily chemical and isotopic observations. Mixing models are developed across 11 nested basins (0.4 to 85km(2)) spanning a gradient of climatological, physical, and geological characteristics. Hydrograph separation using rain, snow, and groundwater as end-members indicates that seasonal contributions of groundwater to streams is significant. Mean annual groundwater flux ranges from 12% to 33% whereas maximum groundwater contributions of 17% to 50% occur during baseflow. The direct relationship between snow water equivalent and groundwater flux to streams is scale dependent with a trend toward self-similarity when basins exceed 5.5km(2). We find groundwater recharge increases in basins of high relief and within the upper subalpine where maximum snow accumulation is coincident with reduced conifer cover and lower canopy densities. The mixing model developed for the furthest downstream site did not transfer to upstream basins. The resulting error in predicted stream concentrations points toward weathering reactions as a function of source rock and seasonal shifts in flow path. Additionally, the potential for microbial sulfate reduction in floodplain sediments along a low-gradient, meandering portion of the river is sufficient to modify hillslope contributions and alter mixing ratios in the analysis. Soil flushing in response to snowmelt is not included as an end-member but is identified as an important mechanism for release of solutes from these mountainous watersheds. End-member mixing analysis used in combination with high-frequency observations reveals important aspects of catchment hydrodynamics across scale.

AB Estimates of groundwater volumes available in semiarid regions that rely on water balance calculations require the determination of both surface to groundwater lag times and volumes from irrigation or rainfall initiated recharge. Subsurface geologic material hydraulic properties (e. g. hydraulic conductivities, water retention functions) necessary for unsaturated flow modelling are rarely available as are the instrumented field tests that might determine such lag times. Here we develop a simple two-parameter (specific yield, S-y, and pore-size distribution index, lambda), one-dimensional unsaturated flow model from simplifications of the Richards equation (using the Brooks-Corey relationships) to determine lag times from agricultural deep drainage associated with the irrigation of alfalfa hay and various row crops in the Antelope Valley of California, USA. Model-predicted lag times to depths of 85m bgs (below ground surface) were similar to that measured in a 2-year ponded recharge field trial, slightly overestimating that measured by approximately 15% (0.51 vs 0.44 years). Lag time estimates were most sensitive to estimated deep percolation rates and roughly equally sensitive to the model hydraulic parameters. Generally, as subsurface material textures coarsen towards larger S-y and lambda values for all S-y > 10%, lag times progressively increase; however, at S-y < 10%, lag times decrease substantially suggesting that particular combinations of S-y and lambda values that may be associated with similarly textured materials can result in the prediction of different lag times for S-y approximately 10%. Overall, lag times of 1-3 years to a depth of 69 m bgs were estimated from deep drainage of agricultural irrigation across a variety of irrigation schedules and subsurface materials.

AB Snow availability in Alpine catchments plays an important role in water resources management. In this paper, we propose a method for an optimal estimation of snow depth (areal extension and thickness) in Alpine systems from point data and satellite observations by using significant explanatory variables deduced from a digital terrain model. It is intended to be a parsimonious approach that may complement physical-based methodologies. Different techniques (multiple regression, multicriteria analysis, and kriging) are integrated to address the following issues: We identify the explanatory variables that could be helpful on the basis of a critical review of the scientific literature. We study the relationship between ground observations and explanatory variables using a systematic procedure for a complete multiple regression analysis. Multiple regression models are calibrated combining all suggested model structures and explanatory variables. We also propose an evaluation of the models (using indices to analyze the goodness of fit) and select the best approaches (models and variables) on the basis of multicriteria analysis. Estimation of the snow depth is performed with the selected regression models. The residual estimation is improved by applying kriging in cases with spatial correlation. The final estimate is obtained by combining regression and kriging results, and constraining the snow domain in accordance with satellite data. The method is illustrated using the case study of the Sierra Nevada mountain range (Southern Spain). A cross-validation experiment has confirmed the efficiency of the proposed procedure. Finally, although it is not the scope of this work, the snow depth is used to asses a first estimation of snow water equivalent resources.

AB The level of model complexity that can be effectively supported by available information has long been a subject of many studies in hydrologic modelling. In particular, distributed parameter models tend to be regarded as overparameterized because of numerous parameters used to describe spatially heterogeneous hydrologic processes. However, it is not clear how parameters and observations influence the degree of overparameterization, equifinality of parameter values, and uncertainty. This study investigated the impact of the numbers of observations and parameters on calibration quality including equifinality among calibrated parameter values, model performance, and output/parameter uncertainty using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. In the experiments, the number of observations was increased by expanding the calibration period or by including measurements made at inner points of a watershed. Similarly, additional calibration parameters were included in the order of their sensitivity. Then, unique sets of parameters were calibrated with the same objective function, optimization algorithm, and stopping criteria but different numbers of observations. The calibration quality was quantified with statistics calculated based on the behavioural' parameter sets, identified using 1% and 5% cut-off thresholds in a generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation framework. The study demonstrated that equifinality, model performance, and output/parameter uncertainty were responsive to the numbers of observations and calibration parameters; however, the relationship between the numbers, equifinality, and uncertainty was not always conclusive. Model performance improved with increased numbers of calibration parameters and observations, and substantial equifinality did neither necessarily mean bad model performance nor large uncertainty in the model outputs and parameters.

AB Previous work has shown that streamflow response during baseflow conditions is a function of storage, but also that this functional relationship varies among seasons and catchments. Traditionally, hydrological models incorporate conceptual groundwater models consisting of linear or non-linear storage-outflow functions. Identification of the right model structure and model parameterization however is challenging. The aim of this paper is to systematically test different model structures in a set of catchments where different aquifer types govern baseflow generation processes. Nine different two-parameter conceptual groundwater models are applied with multi-objective calibration to transform two different groundwater recharge series derived from a soil-atmosphere-vegetation transfer model into baseflow separated from streamflow data. The relative performance differences of the model structures allow to systematically improve the understanding of baseflow generation processes and to identify most appropriate model structures for different aquifer types. We found more versatile and more aquifer-specific optimal model structures and elucidate the role of interflow, flow paths, recharge regimes and partially contributing storages. Aquifer-specific recommendations of storage models were found for fractured and karstic aquifers, whereas large storage capacities blur the identification of superior model structures for complex and porous aquifers. A model performance matrix is presented, which highlights the joint effects of different recharge inputs, calibration criteria, model structures and aquifer types. The matrix is a guidance to improve groundwater model structures towards their representation of the dominant baseflow generation processes of specific aquifer types.

AB Increased erosion associated with land use change often alters the flux of sediments and nutrients, but few studies have looked at the interaction between these disrupted cycles. We studied the effects of gully erosion on carbon and nitrogen storage in surface soil/sediment and herbaceous vegetation and on C and N mineralization in a headwater catchment used for cattle grazing. We found significantly lower C and N stored in an incising gully compared with an intact valley. This storage was significantly higher in an adjacent stabilizing gully, although not to the levels found in the intact valley. The intact valley had two to four times higher soil/sediment concentrations of total organic C, total N and Colwell extractable P than the incising gully. Lower storage was not explained by differences in vegetation biomass density or silt and clay content. Vegetation accounted for only 8% of C and 2% of N storage. Although not a significant store in itself, vegetation has an important indirect role in restoring and maintaining soil/sediment C and N stocks in eroding areas. We found significant linear relationships between C and N mineralization rates and soil/sediment C and N content, with lower rates occurring in the eroded sediment. These findings support our initial hypothesis that gully erosion reduces C and N storage and mineralization rates in eroding catchments. The implications of this study include a change to the quality of eroded sediments in headwater catchments, causing C-poorer and N-poorer sediments to be exported but overall loads to increase.

SSCs were calculated from turbidity recordings (1-h time step). converted into SSC values. The rating curve was calculated by means of simultaneous SSC measurement taken by water sampling and turbidity recording, Violent storms during springtime and autumn were responsible for suspended sediment transport oil the Asse and the Bleone rivers. Oil the Ferrand and the Romanche. a large share of suspended sediment transport was also caused by local storms. but 30% of annual fluxes results front snowmelt or icemelt Which Occurred from April to October. Oil each Watershed. SSC Up to 50 g l(-1) were observed. Annual Specific fluxes ranged from 450 to 800 t km(-2) year(-1) and 40-80% of annual suspended sediment fluxes Occurred within 2% of the time. These general indicators clearly demonstrate the intensity Of Suspended sediment transport oil these types of watersheds. Suspended sediment fluxes proved to be highly variable at the annual scale (inter-annual variability of specific fluxes) as well as at the event scale (through a hysteresis loop in the SSC/Q relationship) on these watersheds. In both cases, water discharge and precipitations were the Main processes involved in Suspended sediment production and transport. The temporal and spatial variability of hydro-meteorological processes on the watershed provides a better understanding of suspended sediment dynamics. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

AB The water balance equation dictates that streamflow may be reduced by transpiration. Yet temporal disequilibrium weakens the relationship between transpiration and streamflow in many cases where inputs and outputs are unbalanced. We address two critical knowledge barriers in ecohydrology with respect to time, scale dependence and lags. Study objectives were to correlate components of the water balance equation at hourly to annual scales, quantify time lags, and simplify critical components of the water budget during wet and dry conditions. We tested interrelationships among precipitation, vapour pressure deficit, transpiration, soil moisture, and streamflow within the confines of a 60-hectare forested watershed in the western Cascades of Oregon. The Pacific Northwest is an ideal location to compare wet and dry seasons because of its Mediterranean climate. Soil moisture explained more than 80% of the variation in streamflow at all temporal scales investigated. Streamflow was most strongly coupled to soil moisture in the wet season because of gravitational drainage patterns; strong coupling of transpiration to vapour pressure deficit was dominant in the dry season and driven by low humidity. We observed progressively longer hourly time lags between soil moisture and streamflow in the dry season, which relates to an increasing soil moisture deficit that took an average of 48 days to refill after the onset of winter rains. We propose that transpiration drives seasonal patterns in soil moisture that relate to patterns in streamflow only after long time lags. In other words, soil moisture mediates the influence of transpiration on streamflow. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We used hydrochemistry and environmental isotope data (delta O-18, delta D, tritium, and C-14) to investigate the characteristics of river water, groundwater, and groundwater recharge in China's Heihe River basin. The river water and groundwater could be characterized as Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3--SO42- and Na+-Mg2+-SO42--Cl- types, respectively. Hydrogeochemical modelling using PHREEQC software revealed that the main hydrogeochemical processes are dissolution (except for gypsum and anhydrite) along groundwater flow paths from the upper to middle Heihe reaches. Towards the lower reaches, dolomite and calcite tend to precipitate. The isotopic data for most of the river water and groundwater lie on the global meteoric water line (GMWL) or between the GMWL and the meteoric water line in northwestern China, indicating weak evaporation. No direct relationship existed between recharge and discharge of groundwater in the middle and lower reaches based on the isotope ratios, d-excess, and C-14 values. On the basis of tritium in precipitation and by adopting an exponential piston-flow model, we evaluated the mean residence time of shallow groundwater with high tritium activities, which was around 50 years (a). Furthermore, based on the several popular models, it is calculated that the deep groundwaters in piedmont alluvial fan zone of the middle reaches and in southern part of the lower reaches are modern water, whereas the deep groundwaters in the edge of the middle reaches and around Juyan Lake in the lower reaches of Heihe river basin are old water.

AB The spatial and temporal characteristics of annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWEmax) and fall and spring snow cover duration (SCD) were analysed over Quebec and adjacent area for snow seasons 1948/1949-2004/2005 using reconstructed daily snow depth and SWE. Snow cover variability in Quebec was found to be significantly correlated with most of the major atmospheric circulation patterns affecting the climate of eastern North America but the influence was characterized by strong multidecadal-scale variability. The strongest and most consistent relationship was observed between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and fall SCD variability over western Quebec. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was found to have a limited impact on Quebec snow cover. Evidence was found for a shift in circulation over the study region around 1980 associated with an abrupt increase in sea level pressure (SLP) and decreases in winter precipitation, snow depth and SWE over much of southern Quebec, as well as changes in the atmospheric patterns with significant links to snow cover variability. Trend analysis of the reconstructed snow cover over 1948-2005 provided evidence of a clear north-south gradient in SWEmax and spring SCD with significant local decreases over southern Quebec and significant local increases over north-central Quebec. The increase in SWEmax over northern Quebec is consistent with proxy data (lake levels, tree growth forms, permafrost temperatures), with hemispheric-wide trends of increasing precipitation over higher latitudes, and with projections of global climate models (GCMs).

AB From May to October 2010, throughfall associated with 38 rainfall events in three below-canopy zones (inner canopy, mid-canopy and canopy periphery) of nine juvenile lodgepole pine trees and in open areas between canopies was measured along north, south, east and west transects radiating from each tree bole. Median cumulative throughfall (%) significantly differed among the canopy zones under differing rain depth classes and was negatively correlated with tree size metrics, but only for certain combinations of canopy zones and rain depth classes. Although median cumulative throughfall (%) was negatively correlated with canopy cover fraction when all below-canopy gauges were considered, this relationship only held true for the inner-canopy and mid-canopy zones under relatively small rain depth classes. Additionally, cumulative throughfall (%) was often dependent on transect direction, with event throughfall showing a dependence on the direction of storm origin. Throughfall coefficient of variation (%) also varied by zone and was a function of not only rainfall depth but also other storm variables such as the maximum 30-min rainfall intensity and the number and duration of intra-storm breaks. Temporal persistence of throughfall was assessed using time stability plots and Spearman rank coefficients of rain event and depth class pairings for all gauges and by canopy zone, and the influence of temporal lag and meteorological variables on persistence was assessed. The implications of our findings on throughfall sampling and for future ecohydrological studies in juvenile lodgepole pine and similar stands are discussed. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil-tree water relationships were studied using time domain reflectometry (TDR) in two small forested basins in Spain. The stem water content of two Mediterranean Quercus species (Quercus pyrenaica and Quercus rotundifolia) was measured using previously constructed species- specific equations. To monitor soil moisture, a TDR station network was used in both cases. Sixteen Q. pyrenaica and six Q. rotundifolia individuals were selected to install two TDR probes in their trunks (at 20 and 120 cm above the ground) to monitor stem water content. Stem and soil water contents were measured fortnightly. The stem water content of both species showed a similar temporal trend for the period studied. A spring maximum (0-654 cm(3) cm(-3) for Q. pyrenaica and 0.568 cm(3) cm(-3) for Q. rotundifolia) was found to be associated with high transpiration and no soil moisture deficit, and a late-summer minimum (0.520 cm(3) cm(-3) for Q. pyrenaica and 0.426 cm(3) cm(-3) for Q. rotundifolia) was associated with the end of the dry season. This drop in stem water content occurs when the available water in the soil decreases. This seasonal difference presumably reflects water withdrawn from stem storage to support the transpirational demands of the tree. Since plant water stress results in reduced stem water content and since this drop can be measured by TDR, it may be concluded that this technology offers a suitable tool for detecting plant water stress.

AB To predict the long-term sustainability of water resources on the Boreal Plain region of northern Alberta, it is critical to understand when hillslopes generate runoff and connect with surface waters. The sub-humid climate (P <= ET) and deep glacial sediments of this region result in large available soil storage capacity relative to moisture surpluses or deficits, leading to thershold-dependent rainfall-runoff relationships. Rainfall simulation experiments were conducted using large magnitude and high intensity applications to examine the thresholds in precipitation and soil moisture that are necessary to generate lateral flow from hillslope runoff plots representative of Luvisolic soils and an aspen canopy. Two adjacent plots (areas of 2.95) and 3.4 m(2)) of constrasting antecedent moisture conditions were examined; one had tree root uptake excluded for two months to increase soil moisture content, while the second plot allowed tree uptake over the growing season resulting in drier soils. Vertical flow as drainage and soil moisture storage dominated the water balances of both plots. Greater lateral flow occured from the plot with higher antecedent moisture content. Results indicate that a minimum of 15-20 mm of rainfall is required to generate lateral flow, and only after the soils have been wetted to a depth of 0.75 m (C-horizon). The depth and intensity of rainfall events that generated runoff > 1 mm have return period of 25 years or greater and when combined with the need for wet antecendent conditions, indicate that lateral flow generation on these hillslopes will occur infrequently.

AB Most often drought analysis methodologies are based on point-wise time series record assessments with very specific local conclusions, but their areal, regional and in general spatial properties are examined to a lesser extent. This paper will provide general description of droughts in addition to the regional methodological approaches with rather simple but innovative manner. The study area is thought as composed of a set of sub-areas each with different dry (wet) period probabilities. In general, heterogeneous region has different probability of dry(wet) spell occurrence at each sub-area. In fact, whenever the probability at each sub-area is not equal to any other sub-area, it corresponds to heterogeneous region. The areal cover probability (ACP) of the region is derived by considering the point-wise probabilities on the assumptions that the occurrences of dry (wet) spells are mutually exclusive, independent with heterogeneous probability patterns. Additionally extreme value probabilities of areal drought coverage are derived for heterogeneous sub-area probabilities. All of the heterogeneous drought probability expressions reduce down to homogeneous case provided that sub-areal probabilities are equal to each other. The methodology presented in this paper paves ways for more realistic drought phenomenon spatial probability of occurrences when the sub-areal dry spell probabilities are dependent on each other but heterogeneous.

AB This research demonstrates the spatiotemporal variations of albedo on nine glaciers in western China during 2000-2011, by the albedo derived from two types of datasets: Landsat TM/ETM + images and MOD10A1 product. Then, the influence factors of glacier albedo and its relationship with glacier mass balance are also analyzed by the correlation approach, which is frequently used in geostatistics. The paper finds that there are different spatiotemporal variations over the glaciers in western China: (1) For a single glacier, the albedo varies gently with altitude on its tongue and increases fast in the middle part, while in the accumulation zones, the albedo value appears in the form of fluctuation. This could provide a quantitative method to retrieve the snowline by determining the threshold albedo value of snowpack and bare ice. (2) For the glaciers in western China, the albedo decreases with distance to the center of Tibetan Plateau (TP). This may relate to the elevation of glacier, for the speed of glacier retreat highly depends on air temperature. (3) In the summer period, albedo on most glaciers declines over the last 12 years, and it decreases much faster in southeastern TP than other regions, for which air temperature overwhelms the black carbon concentration. In addition, the trend of glacier albedo in summer is greatly correlated with that of measured glacier mass balance, which implies that the long-term albedo datasets by remote sensing technology could be used to monitor and predict the change of glacier mass balance in the future.

AB Streamflow in the upper Colorado River in the western USA is always snowmelt dominated. whereas the lower river's perennial streamflows are snowmelt dominated only 50% of the it me. The magnitude and timing of peak flows is important for water resources management. In the upper basin the annual maximum daily discharge usually occurs in May or June, and in the lower basin this peak is observed to occur in any month except May or June. The timing of one-half of the specific runoff is used as a second measure of the variability in timing and magnitude of streamflows. For the upper basin, nine watersheds are used to illustrate streamflow trends, with the Yampa River used as a sample sub-basin. For the lower basin, five watersheds are used. of which Salt River is used as sample sub-basin. The differences in monthly flow variation over 20-year time periods (1920-1939, 1940-1959, 1960-1979, and 1980-1999) are substantial for the Salt River but not for the Yampa River.
   Three model types were used to estimate streamflow characteristics. An autocorrelation model was used to generate winter specific runoffs, which were more reasonable for the Yampa River than the Salt River. A regression between snow water equivalent (SWE) and winter specific runoff showed a good correlation for the two sub-basins. A weaker relationship exists between SWE and non-winter flows for the sample lower basin watershed. Streamflow was simulated relatively well using the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System hydrological model. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Wildfires can impact streamflow by modifying net precipitation, infiltration, evapotranspiration, snowmelt, and hillslope run-off pathways. Regional differences in fire trends and postwildfire streamflow responses across the conterminous United States have spurred concerns about the impact on streamflow in forests that serve as water resource areas. This is notably the case for the Western United States, where fire activity and burn severity have increased in conjunction with climate change and increased forest density due to human fire suppression. In this review, we discuss the effects of wildfire on hydrological processes with a special focus on regional differences in postwildfire streamflow responses in forests. Postwildfire peak flows and annual water yields are generally higher in regions with a Mediterranean or semi-arid climate (Southern California and the Southwest) compared to the highlands (Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Northwest), where fire-induced changes in hydraulic connectivity along the hillslope results in the delivery of more water, more rapidly to streams. No clear streamflow response patterns have been identified in the humid subtropical Southeastern United States, where most fires are prescribed fires with a low burn severity, and more research is needed in that region. Improved assessment of postwildfire streamflow relies on quantitative spatial knowledge of landscape variables such as prestorm soil moisture, burn severity and correlations with soil surface sealing, water repellency, and ash deposition. The latest studies furthermore emphasize that understanding the effects of hydrological processes on postwildfire dynamic hydraulic connectivity, notably at the hillslope and watershed scales, and the relationship between overlapping disturbances including those other than wildfire is necessary for the development of risk assessment tools.

AB Experimental work has clearly shown that the effective hydraulic conductivity (K-e) or effective infiltration rate (f(e)) on the local scale of a plot cannot be considered as constant but are dependent on water depth and rainfall intensity because non-random microtopography-related variations in hydraulic conductivity occur. Rainfall-runoff models generally do not account for this: models assume that excess water is uniformly spread over the soil surface and within-plot variations are neglected. In the present study, we propose a model that is based on the concepts of microtopography-related water depth-dependent infiltration and partial contributing area. Expressions for the plot scale K-e and f(e) were developed that depend on rainfall intensity and runon from upslope (and thus on water depth). To calibrate and validate the model, steady state infiltration experiments were conducted on maize fields on silt loam soils in Belgium, with different stages and combinations of rainfall intensity and inflow, simulating rainfall and runon. Water depth-discharge and depth-inundation relationships were established and used to estimate the effect of inundation on K-e. Although inflow-only experiments were found to be unsuitable for calibration, the model was successfully calibrated and validated with the rainfall simulation data and combined rainfall-runon data (R-2: 0.43-0.91). Calibrated and validated with steady state infiltration experiments, the model was combined with the Green-Ampt infiltration equation and can be applied within a two-dimensional distributed rainfall-runoff model. The effect of water depth-dependency and rainfall intensity on infiltration was illustrated for a hillslope. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE radiation; diurnal distribution of rainfall; ground-based
   hydrometeorological observation; evaporation; tropical monsoon climate
AB Solar radiation is an important input to many empirical equations for estimating evaporation, which in turn plays all important role in the hydrologic cycle in the Lower Mekong River Basin due to the high evaporation potential of the tropical monsoon climate. Few proper meteorological data exist for the Lower Mekong River Basin, however, and the region's meteorological conditions, including seasonal variation in radiation and evaporation, have not been clarified. In this study, ground-based hourly hydrometeorological data were collected at three observation stations located in different land-Use types (urban district, paddy area, and lake) in the Lower Mekong River Basin. These data were analysed to investigate the seasonal variation ill radiation and evaporation related to the diurnal distribution of rainfall. Contrary to common expectations, our results showed that rainy and dry seasons had nearly the same amount of solar radiation in the Lower Mekong River Basin because (1) rainy seasons had a relatively larger amount of extraterrestrial radiation; (2) no rain fell oil nearly half of the days during rainy seasons; and (3) the amount of solar radiation on rainy days reached 88% of that on non-rainy days. The third factor was attributed to the high frequency of evening rainfall. Furthermore, this rainfall-radiation relationship meant that rainy seasons had a large amount of net radiation due to the low reduction ratio of solar radiation and an increase in long-wave incoming radiation. Accordingly, rainy seasons had a high evaporation potential. Moreover, for the rain-fed rice paddies that prevail in this region, sufficient radiation during the rainy season Would be a great advantage for rice growing.

AB The aim of this paper is to quantify peakflow attenuation and/or amplification in a river, investigating lateral flow from the intermediate catchment during floods. This is a challenge for the study of the hydrological response of permeable/intermittent streams, and our contribution refers to a modelling framework based on the inverse problem for the diffusive wave model applied in a karst catchment. Knowing the upstream and downstream hydrographs on a reach between two stations, we can model the lateral one, given information on the hydrological processes involved in the intermediate catchment. The model is applied to 33 flood events in the karst reach of the Iton River in French Normandy where peakflow attenuation is observed. The monitored zone consists of a succession of losing and gaining reaches controlled by strong surface-water/groundwater (SW/GW) interactions. Our results show that despite a high baseflow increase in the reach, peakflow is attenuated. Model application shows that the intensity of lateral outflow for the flood component is linked to upstream discharge. A combination of river loss and overbank flow for highest floods is proposed for explaining the relationships. Our approach differentiates the role of outflow (river loss and overbank flow) and that of wave diffusion on peakflow attenuation. Based on several sets of model parameterization, diffusion is the main attenuation process for most cases, despite high river losses of up to several m(3)/s (half of peakflow for some parameterization strategies). Finally, this framework gives new insight into the SW/GW interactions during floods in karst basins, and more globally in basins characterized by disconnected river-aquifer systems.

AB Leaf litter interception of water is an integral component of the water budget for some vegetated ecosystems. However, loss of rainfall to litter receives considerably less attention than canopy interception due to lack of suitable sensors to measure changes in litter water content. In this study. a commercially available leaf wetness sensor was calibrated to the gravimetric water content of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) litter and used to estimate litter interception in a subhumid eastern redcedar woodland in north-central Oklahoma. Under controlled laboratory conditions, a strong positive correlation between the leaf wetness sensor output voltage (mV) and measured gravimetric litter water content (theta(g))( )was determined: theta(g) = (.0009 x mV(2)) (0.14 x mV) - 11.41 (R-2 = .94, p < .0001). This relationship was validated with field sampling and the output voltage (mV) accounted for 48% of the observed variance in the measured water content. The maximum and minimum interception storage capacity ranged between 1.16 and 12.04 and 1.12 and 9.62 mm, respectively. The maximum and minimum amount of intercepted rain was positively correlated to rainfall amount and intensity. The continuous field measurements demonstrated that eastern redcedar litter intercepted approximately 8% of the gross rainfall that fell between December 16, 2014 and May 31, 2015. Therefore, rainfall loss to litter can constitute a substantial component of the annual water budget. Long-term in situ measurement of litter interception loss is necessary to gain a better estimate of water availability for streamflow and recharge. This is critical to manage water resources in the south-central Great Plains, USA where grasslands are rapidly being transformed to woodland or woody dominated savanna.

AB Owing to the crucial environmental and hydrological functions of river systems and intensive human disturbance, further investigations of their change patterns and flood control functions are urgently needed. The Rapidly Urbanized Taihu Basin (RUTB) was selected as the study region to investigate changes in the river networks, the relationship between changes in river systems and urbanization, and the changes in the static drainage storage capacity (SC) and regulation capacity (RC) from the 1980s to the 2010s. The results indicated that the total drainage density in RUTB decreased by 10.17%. For the first-, second-, and third-order rivers, the changes are +7.61%, -14.35%, and -17.84%, respectively. Spatially, the change pattern of the third-order river drainage density displayed significant spatial clustering. The ratio of main to tributary river length (Rmt) was increased from 0.31 in the 1980s to 0.39 in the 2010s. Spatially, the drastic increases were found in the south-east of Wu-Cheng-Xi-Yu, the east of Yang-Cheng-Dian-Mao, and the central southern part of Hang-Jia-Hu. Results moreover show that urbanization has the greatest influence on the third-order drainage density, especially around the secondary and rapidly developing cities. The demand for flood control has led to a slight increase in the density of main rivers. The values of SC and RC decreased by 0.69% and 40.61% in RUTB, respectively. These changes were mainly concentrated around the major cities and urban corridors. The decrease in SC was caused by the decay of the river system, and the reduction in RC was caused by a combination of river system degradation and increase in ordinary water levels.

AB Assessment of potential climate change impacts on stream water temperature (T-s) across large scales remains challenging for resource managers because energy exchange processes between the atmosphere and the stream environment are complex and uncertain, and few long-term datasets are available to evaluate changes over time. In this study, we demonstrate how simple monthly linear regression models based on short-term historical T-s observations and readily available interpolated air temperature (T-a) estimates can be used for rapid assessment of historical and future changes in T-s. Models were developed for 61 sites in the southeastern USA using 18months of observations and were validated at sites with longer periods of record. The T-s models were then used to estimate temporal changes in T-s at each site using both historical estimates and future T-a projections. Results suggested that the linear regression models adequately explained the variability in T-s across sites, and the relationships between T-s and T-a remained consistent over 37years. We estimated that most sites had increases in historical annual mean T-s between 1961 and 2010 (mean of +0.11 degrees C decade(-1)). All 61 sites were projected to experience increases in T-s from 2011 to 2060 under the three climate projections evaluated (mean of +0.41 degrees C decade(-1)). Several of the sites with the largest historical and future T-s changes were located in ecoregions home to temperature-sensitive fish species. This methodology can be used by resource managers for rapid assessment of potential climate change impacts on stream water temperature. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper presents a field investigation on river channel storage of fine sediments in an unglaciated braided river, the Bes River, located in a mountainous region in the southern French Prealps. Braided rivers transport a very large quantity of bedload and suspended sediment load because they are generally located in the vicinity of highly erosive hillslopes. Consequently, these rivers play an important role because they supply and control the sediment load of the entire downstream fluvial network. Field measurements and aerial photograph analyses were considered together to evaluate the variability of fine sediment quantity stored in a 2.5-km-long river reach. This study found very large quantities of fine sediment stored in this reach: 1100 t per unit depth (1 dm). Given that this reach accounts for 17% of the braided channel surface area of the river basin, the quantities of fine sediment stored in the river network were found to be approximately 80% of the mean annual suspended sediment yields (SSYs) (66 200 t year(-1)), comparable to the SSYs at the flood event scale: from 1000 t to 12 000 t depending on the flood event magnitude. These results could explain the clockwise hysteretic relationships between suspended sediment concentrations and discharges for 80% of floods. This pattern is associated with the rapid availability of the fine sediments stored in the river channel. This study shows the need to focus on not only the mechanisms of fine sediment production from hillslope erosion but also the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine sediment transfer in braided rivers.

AB The main Patagonian rivers (Colorado, Negro, Chubut, Deseado, Coyle, Chico, Santa Cruz and Gallegos) were sampled between September 1995 and November 1998 to determine their chemical and isotopic compositions, the origins of the suspended and dissolved river loads and their inputs to the South Atlantic Ocean. This paper focuses on the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transport and its delta C-13 isotopic signature. The delta(13) C-DIC values vary between -12.8 and -1.8% and allow one to distinguish two river groups: (i) the Colorado, Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, which display the highest values and the lowest seasonal variations; (ii) the Deseado, Coyle, Chico and Gallegos, which show the lowest values and the highest seasonal variations. For the first group, delta C-13(DIC) is mainly controlled by important exchanges between the river waters and atmospheric CO2, due to the presence of lakes and dams. For the second group, delta(13) C-DIC also appears to be controlled by the oxidation of organic carbon, showing a negative relationship between delta 13 C-DIC and the dissolved organic carbon. These biogeochemical processes interfere with the contribution of carbonate and silicate weathering to the riverine DIC and do not allow use of delta(13) C-DIC alone to distinguish these contributions.
   The annual DIC flux exported by Patagonian Rivers to the South Atlantic Ocean averages 621 x 10(9) g. of C, i.e. a specific yield of 2-7 g m(-2) year(-1). The mean delta C-13(DIC) can be estimated to -4.9%, which is high compared with other rivers of the world. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Negative trends of measured pan evaporation are widely reported. Studies of the factors that underlie this reduction in pan evaporation have not reached a consensus about the controlling factors. Most studies employ statistical analysis (correlation analysis or stepwise regression) to identify the controlling climatic variables; in contrast, few studies have employed physical-based theories. In addition, observations of pan evaporation and related climatic variables are reported to be influenced by anthropogenic activities. Consequently, the observed trends of climatic variables in a nature reserve would be useful for understanding regional climate change. The present study site is located in Ailaoshan National Nature Reserve, SW China, which is free of anthropogenic activity. In this study, we firstly applied the adjusted PenPan model to estimate the pan evaporation. Then, using this physical-based model, we identified a positive trend in pan evaporation, with a much larger increase in the dry season than in the wet season. The model results indicate that the change in the aerodynamic component is larger than that in the radiative component. In contrast to the reduction in wind speed and sunshine hours that has been reported in previous studies at various sites, we found that wind speed and sunshine hours have increased in recent decades, thereby explaining the increase of the pan evaporation rate. Wind speed made the greatest contribution to the change in pan evaporation, followed by sunshine duration. This study indicates that the potential evaporation has increased at this site despite the widely reported reduction in measured pan evaporation. During the dry season, the availability of water for agriculture and agroforestry could be threatened. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper presents a correlation between evapotranspiration calculated by the heat budget method using eddy correlation and visible plus near-infrared information from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of a grass-covered site at the Terrestrial Environment Research Center, University of Tsukuba. Eighty Landsat TM images from its 1984 launch until 1998 were collected, and the digital numbers at the site were extracted. The spectral brightness and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are compared with measured evapotranspiration. These data suggest that the vegetation index is a good index of transpiration; however, the relationship differs between the growing season and the mature period. The reflected brightness in the near-infrared band increased during the spring-summer growing season, whereas red brightness decreased during the same period. Since the red wavelength plays an important role in photosynthetic activity, the data in the red band seems to contain information on the physiological activity of the grass. In the mature season after summer, the red brightness value becomes almost constant and evapotranspiration is best correlated with the near-infrared brightness, which is related to incident solar radiation. The relationship between NDVI and evapotranspiration should be considered separately for the growing and mature seasons because the inherent physics in the relationship differs according to phenological stages. Understanding the relationship between satellite-derived vegetation phenology and surface flux is useful for delineating basin-wide hydrological characteristics, since satellite data covers an extensive area and the time changes in spectral brightness were found to provide information about surface flux.

AB Analytical models have been exhaustively used to study simple seawater intrusion problems and the sustainable management of groundwater resources in coastal aquifers because of its simplicity, easy implementation, and low computational cost. Most of these models are based on the sharp-interface approximation and the Ghyben-Herzberg relation, and their governing equations are expressed in terms of a single potential theory to calculate critical pumping rates in a coastal pumping scenario. The Ghyben-Herzberg approach neglects mixing of fresh water and seawater and implicitly assumes that salt water remains static. Therefore, the results of the analytical solutions may be inaccurate and unacceptable for some real-complex case studies. This paper provides insight into the validity of sharp-interface models to deal with seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers, i.e. when they can be applied to obtain accurate enough results. For that purpose, this work compares sharp-interface solutions, based on the Ghyben-Herzberg approach, with numerical three-dimensional variable-density flow simulations for a set of heterogeneous groundwater flow and mass transport parameters, and different scenarios of spatially distributed recharge values and spatial wells placement. The numerical experiment has been carried out in a 3D unconfined synthetic aquifer using the finite difference numerical code SEAWAT for solving the coupled partial differential equations of flow and density-dependent transport. This paper finds under which situations the sharp-interface solution gives good predictions in terms of seawater penetration, transition zone width and critical pumping rates. Additionally, the simulation runs indicate to which parameters and scenarios the results are more sensitive. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Rainfall simulators can enhance our understanding of the hydrologic processes affecting the total runoff to urban drainage systems. This knowledge can be used to improve urban drainage designs. In this study, a rainfall simulator is developed to simulate rainfall on urban green surfaces. The rainfall simulator is controlled by a microcomputer programmed to replicate the temporal variations in rainfall intensity of both historical and synthetic rainfall events with constant rainfall intensity on an area of 1 m(2). The performance of the rainfall simulator is tested under laboratory conditions with regard to spatial uniformity of the rainfall, the kinetic energy of the raindrops, and the ability to replicate historical and synthetic rainfall events with temporally varying intensity. The rainfall simulator is applied in the field to evaluate its functionality under field conditions and the influence of wind on simulated rainfall. Finally, a field study is carried out on the relationship between runoff, soil volumetric water content, and surface slope. Performance and field tests show that the simulated rainfall has a uniform spatial distribution, whereas the kinetic energy of the raindrops is slightly higher than that of other comparable rainfall simulators. The rainfall simulator performs best in low wind speed conditions. The simulator performs well in replicating historical and synthetic rainfall events by matching both intensity variations and accumulated rainfall depth.

AB Literature has long documented how streamflow response in boreal hillslopes and catchments is influenced by storage capacities, thresholds, and landscape and runoff pathway heterogeneity. More recently, the influence these traits have on streamflow has been interpreted through the concept of hydrological connectivity. However, the nature of hydrological connectivity in boreal catchments has only begun to be described. The focus of hydrological connectivity studies at the catchment scale has been on discerning from which areas does runoff originate and when, but not necessarily discovering the source waters of this streamflow. This has been the realm of studies investigating residence time and runoff pathways. This article summarizes an investigation in a 155-km(2) catchment in Canada's Northwest Territories that applied both hydrometric and geochemical methods to measure streamflow response, storage state, connectivity and source waters. The goal of this research was to determine if a catchment scale metric of connectivity could be sensitive to changes in source waters and runoff pathways in a boreal landscape, so as to improve the predictive role of connectivity metrics. Nine runoff events from three water years were evaluated. There were distinct patterns of hydrological connectivity, which included, among others, a non-linear relationship with the runoff ratio and hysteresis with streamflow. The results indicate that one metric of connectivity alone could not encapsulate connectivity extent and quality, identify water sources and be used successfully to predict runoff response. Multiple metrics were needed that further encapsulated the role of precipitation and hydrological processes on both structural and dynamic connectivity.

AB Urbanization is characterized by increased impervious cover, artificial drainage via sewers, soil compaction, and vegetation removal, which fundamentally alters how water moves across landscapes. Less rainwater and snowmelt infiltrate the subsurface and stream responses to precipitation are faster and larger compared to natural environments. While the impacts of catchment imperviousness on hydrologic processes have been widely investigated, the relationship between stream hydrologic response and infrastructure-mediated hydrologic connectivity across a wide range of urban watersheds has not. This study examines the relative magnitude of control that catchment characteristics, total impervious area (TIA), and sewer-corrected TIA have on broad-scale spatial variability in hydrologic response. Sewer-corrected TIA accounts for inter-catchment water transfer via storm and/or combined sewer pipes and is feasible to estimate at the watershed-scale using urban drainage asset data. Daily stream discharge data were used to calculate the Richards-Baker Flashiness Index for 96 watersheds located across southern Ontario, Canada. For a subset of watersheds (n = 39) with suitable stream discharge and rainfall data, watershed average event runoff ratio (RR) was calculated, and watersheds with spatial sewer network data (n = 24), were used to assess if sewer-corrected TIA is a better predictor of hydrologic response than TIA. As expected, stream flashiness and RR increased linearly as a function of TIA and sewer-corrected TIA, however, sewer-corrected TIA did not explain any additional variability in the response variables. Likewise, the relative control of catchment characteristics on the spatial variability in streamflow generation were negligible. Despite sewer-corrected TIA not improving our understanding of broad scale variation in runoff response, it could be a useful metric to consider when assessing inter-event variability in runoff response of, heavily urbanized sub-catchments for improved understanding of flooding and water quality.

AB The stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen (delta H-2 and delta O-18, respectively) have been widely used to investigate tree water source partitioning. These tracers have shed new light on patterns of tree water use in time and space. However, there are several limiting factors to this methodology (e.g., the difficult assessment of isotope fractionation in trees, and the labor-intensity associated with the collection of significant sample sizes) and the use of isotopes alone has not been enough to provide a mechanistic understanding of source water partitioning. Here, we combine isotope data in xylem and soil water with measurements of tree's physiological information including tree water deficit (TWD), fine root distribution, and soil matric potential, to investigate the mechanism driving tree water source partitioning. We used a 2 m(3) lysimeter with willow trees (Salix viminalis) planted within, to conduct a high spatial-temporal resolution experiment. TWD provided an integrated response of plant water status to water supply and demand. The combined isotopic and TWD measurement showed that short-term variation (within days) in source water partitioning is determined mainly by plant hydraulic response to changes in soil matric potential. We observed changes in the relationship between soil matric potential and TWD that are matched by shifts in source water partitioning. Our results show that tree water use is a dynamic process on the time scale of days. These findings demonstrate tree's plasticity to water supply over days can be identified with high-resolution measurements of plant water status. Our results further support that root distribution alone is not an indicator of water uptake dynamics. Overall, we show that combining physiological measurements with traditional isotope tracing can reveal mechanistic insights into plant responses to changing environmental conditions.

AB The translation of rainfall to runoff is significantly affected by canopy interception. Therefore, a realistic representation of the role played by vegetation cover when modelling the rainfall-runoff system is essential for predicting water, sediment, and nutrient transport on hillslopes. Here, we developed a new mathematical model to describe the dynamics of interception, infiltration, and overland flow on canopy-covered sloping land. Based on the relationship between rainfall intensity and the maximum interception rate, the interception process was modelled under two simplified scenarios (i.e., r(e) <= Int(m) and r(e) > Int(m)). Parameterization of the model was based on consideration of both vegetation condition and soil properties. By analysing the given examples, we found that Int(m) reflects the capacity of the canopy to store the precipitation, k reveals the ability of the canopy to retain the intercepted water, and the processes of infiltration and runoff generation are impacted dramatically by Int(m) and k. To evaluate the model, simulated rainfall experiments were conducted in 2 years (2016 and 2017) across six cultivation plots at Changwu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The parameters were obtained by fitting the unit discharge (simulated rainfall experiments in 2016) using the least squares method, and estimation formulas for parameters pertaining to vegetation/soil factors (measured in 2016) were constructed via multiple nonlinear regressions. By matching the simulated results and unit discharge (simulated rainfall experiments in 2017), the validity of the model was verified, and a reasonable precision (average R-2 = .86 and average root mean square error = 6.45) was obtained. The model developed in this research creatively incorporates the canopy interception process to complement the modelling of rainfall infiltration and runoff generation during vegetation growth and offers an improved hydrological basis to analyse matter transport during rainfall events.

TI Exploring the effect of different time resolutions to calculate the
   rainfall erosivity factor R in Calabria, southern Italy
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
DE rainfall erosivity; USLE; soil erosion
ID MEASUREMENT INTERVAL; SOIL LOSS; EROSION
AB The rainfall erosivity factor R of the Universal Soil Loss Equation is a good indicator of the potential of a storm to erode soil, as it quantifies the raindrop impact effect on the soil based on storm intensity. The R-factor is defined as the average annual value of rainfall erosion index, EI, calculated by cumulating the EI values obtained for individual storms for at least 22 years. By definition, calculation of EI is based on rainfall measurements at short time intervals over which the intensity is essentially constant, i.e. using so-called breakpoint data. Because of the scarcity of breakpoint rainfall data, many authors have used different time resolutions (Delta t = 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min) to deduce EI in different areas of the world. This procedure affects the real value of EI because it is strongly dependent on Delta t. In this contribution, after a general overview of similar studies carried out in different countries, the relationship between EI and Delta t is explored in Calabria, southern Italy. The use of 17 139 storm events collected from 65 rainfall stations allowed the calculation of EI for different time intervals ranging from 5 to 60 min. The overall results confirm that calculation of EI is dependent on time resolution and a conversion factor able to provide its value for the required Delta t is necessary. Based on these results, a parametric equation that gives EI as a function of Delta t is proposed, and a regional map of the scale parameter a that represents the conversion factor for converting fixed-interval values of (EI30)(Delta t) to values of (EI30)(15) is provided in order to calculate R anywhere in the region using rainfall data of 60 min.

AB Runoff generation and soil loss from slopes have been studied for decades, but the relationships among runoff, soil loss and rill development are still not well understood. In this paper, rainfall simulation experiments were conducted in two neighbouring plots (scale: 1m by 5m) with four varying slopes (17.6%, 26.8%, 36.4% and 46.6%) and two rainfall intensities (90 and 120mmh(-1)) using two loess soils. Data on rill development were extracted from the digital elevation models by means of photogrammetry. The effects of rainfall intensity and slope gradient on runoff, soil loss and rill development were different for the two soils. The runoff and soil loss from the Anthrosol surface were generally higher than those from the Calcaric Cambisol surface. Higher rainfall intensity produced less runoff and more sediment for almost each treatment. With increasing slope gradient, the values of cumulative runoff and soil loss peaked, except for the treatments with 90mmh(-1) rainfall on the slopes with Anthrosol. With rainfall duration, runoff discharge decreased for Anthrosol and increased for Calcaric Cambisol for almost all the treatments. For both soils, sediment concentration was very high at the onset of rainfall and decreased quickly. Almost all the sediment concentrations increased on the 17.6% and 26.8% slopes and peaked on the 36.4% and 46.6% slopes. Sediment concentrations were higher on the Anthrosol slopes than on the Calcaric Cambisol slopes. At 90mmh(-1) rainfall intensity, increasingly denser rills appeared on the Anthrosol slope as the slope gradient increased, while only steep slopes (36.4% and 46.6%) developed rills for the Calcaric Cambisol soil. The contributions of rill erosion ranged from 36% to 62% of the cumulative soil losses for Anthrosol, while the maximum contribution of rill erosion to the cumulative soil loss was only 37.9% for Calcaric Cambisol.

AB The hydrological role of a headwater swamp in a tropical rainforest is studied using chloride mass balance (CMB) and end-member mixing analysis. There are three main contributions to streamflow: (1) the hillside bedrock aquifer, (2) overland flow from the swamp during storm events and (3) groundwater flow from the swamp aquifer. Before rainfall events of the wet season, the pre-event water comprises a mix of 80% of bedrock aquifer and 20% of swamp aquifer. During storms, the relative contribution of overland flow increases according to the rainfall intensity and the initial saturation rate of the pre-event water reservoirs. The yearly contribution of overland flow from the swamp to the stream is about 31%. The relationship between the swamp and the stream fluctuates with space and time. Generally, the swamp is drained by the stream; however, at the end of long dry seasons, after the first rains, indirect recharge occurs from the stream to the swamp with a hydraulic gradient inversion in the swamp aquifer. The net contribution of the swamp aquifer to the stream is only 4%, which is much lower than the hillside aquifer contribution of about 65%. Recharge on the swamp being very low, these results suggest that, except for a few storms at the end of the dry season, the Nsimi swamp does not contribute to flood attenuation. Evapotranspiration is higher on the hillside than in the swamp. Nevertheless, depletion of water stored within the swamp is dominated by evaporation rather than by its contribution to streamflow. The export of solutes through swamp groundwater flow below the weir is low (< 7%). Nevertheless, the swamp is the most active area of weathering in the watershed. Copyright.

FX Apart from the specific extensive support from the French Institute of
   Research for Development (IRD), our project benefited from the funds
   provided by the national programmes PROSE/PEGI (Programme Sol
   Erosion/Programme Environnement Geosphere Intertropicale) and PNSE
   (Programme National Sol-Erosion) dedicated to a better understanding of
   the humid tropical ecosystems. These programmes were funded both by IRD
   and INSU/CNRS (Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers/Centre
   National de la Recherche Scientifique). The Nsimi watershed was also
   chosen as a reference site for the IGAC-DEBIT programme (International
   Global Atmospheric Chemistry/Deposition of Biogeochemically Important
   Trace Species). The multidisciplinary research carried out on the Nsimi
   watershed began in 1994 under the control of IRD and IRGM-CRH (Institut

AB This study presents the data collected within the framework of an Observatory of Research in Environment on the Amazonian Basin-the ORE HYBAM. It relates to the dissolved and solid loads of the two main rivers of French Guiana, the Maroni and Oyapock rivers, running on the Guiana Shield and draining respectively 64 230 and 24 630 km(2). The low coefficient of variation of the average annual flows of the two rivers indicates an inter-annual hydrological stability probably related to the immediate vicinity of the Atlantic Ocean. The sedimentary load is mainly composed of quartz and kaolinite. The total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations are among the world's lowest values; they range from 1 to 130 mg l(-1) during the hydrological cycle, with averages of 22 and 12 mg l(-1), for the Maroni and Oyapock rivers, respectively. The seasonal variability of these values is significantly higher than that of hydrologic flows, but without simple relationship with the discharge. Water chemical composition of the two rivers indicates a very weak mineralization, very similar to that found in the Amazonian rivers running on the Brazilian and Guianese shields, and in the Congo River and its tributaries in the Central African Shield. Seasonal variations are observed in both basins; they correspond to higher concentrations during low water stage (from October to February) and to more diluted water during the flood, from April to July. A signature enriched in Cl- is present at the Saut Maripa station on the Oyapock River indicating a more marked influence of the trade winds in this basin. The computation of atmospheric contributions to ions budget indicated a weak contribution for Ca2+ and Mg2+, which originates mainly from water-rock interactions in both stations, while more than half of Na+ is derived from atmospheric inputs.

AB The hyporheic zone influences the thermal regime of rivers, buffering temperature by storing and releasing heat over a range of timescales. We examined the relationship between hyporheic exchange and temperature along a 24-km reach of the lower Clackamas River, a large gravel-bed river in northwestern Oregon (median discharge = 75.7 m(3)/s; minimum mean monthly discharge = 22-7 m(3)/s in August 2006). With a simple mixing model, we estimated how much hyporheic exchange cools the river during hot Summer months. Hyporheic exchange was primarily identified by temperature anomalies, which are patches of water that demonstrate at least a 1 degrees C temperature difference from the main channel. Forty hyporheic temperature anomalies were identified through field investigations and thermal-infrared-raiometry (TIR) in summer 2006. The location of anomalies was associated with specific geomorphic features, primarily bar channels and bar heads that act as preferential pathways for hyporheic flow. Detailed field characterization and groundwater modelling on three Clackamas gravel bars indicate residence times of hyporheic water can vary from hours to weeks and months. This was largely determined by hydraulic conductivity, which is affected by how recently the gravel bar formed or was reworked. Upscaling of modelled discharges and hydrologic parameters from these bars to other anomalies on the Clackamas network shows that hyporheic discharge from anomalies comprises a small fraction (<< 1%) of mainstem discharge, resulting in small river-cooling effects (0-012 degrees C). However, the presence of cooler patches of water within rivers can act as thermal refugia for fish and other aquatic organisms, making the creation or enhancement of hyporheic exchange an attractive method in restoring the thermal regime of rivers.

AB In a previous study a spatially distributed hydrological model, based on the MIKE SHE code, was constructed and validated for the 375 000 km(2) Senegal River basin in West Africa. The model was constructed using spatial data on topography, soil types and vegetation characteristics together with time-series of precipitation from 112 stations in the basin. The model was calibrated and validated based on river discharge data from nine stations in the basin for 11 years. Calibration and validation results suggested that the spatial resolution of the input data in parts of the area was not sufficient for a satisfactory evaluation of the modelling performance. The study further examined the spatial patterns in the model input and output, and it was found that particularly the spatial resolution of the precipitation input had a major impact on the model response.
   In an attempt to improve the model performance, this study examines a remotely sensed dryness index for its relationship to simulated soil moisture and evaporation for six days in the wet season 1990. The index is derived from observations of surface temperature and vegetation index as measured by the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor. The correlation results between the index and the simulation results are of mixed quality. A sensitivity analysis, conducted on both estimates, reveals significant uncertainties in both. The study suggests that the remotely sensed dryness index with its current use of NOAA AVHRR data does not offer information that leads to a better calibration or validation of the simulation model in a spatial sense. The method potentially may become more suitable with the use of the upcoming high-resolution temporal Meteosat Second Generation data. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The Kiryu Experimental Catchment (KEW) is a small (5.99 ha) forest catchment located in Shiga Prefecture, central Japan (34 degrees 58 ' N, 136 degrees 00 ' E; ). Around this area, forest devastation occurred from ca. 1250 to ca. 150 years ago because of overuse of forest and timbers. Then, hillside forestation was carried out for more than 100 years to prevent soil erosion and support the timber industry, and consequently, most of this area is now covered with plantation forests mainly by Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. et Zucc. (Japanese cypress) planted around 1960's. This plantation forest is not actively managed. The KEW is one of the leading experimental forests with long-term monitoring data in Japan. Research in the KEW began in 1967 to elucidate the hydrological and biogeochemical processes in the forested catchment in relation to climate, geology, soil, and vegetation growth. Since then, the long-term hydrological data of precipitation, runoff and sediment transport are continuously monitoring. In this study, we provide the data and preliminarily discuss the rainfall-runoff patterns and sediment transport through 50 years in the KEW. The annual precipitation and the maximum daily rainfall have been greater than the average over the last decade. In response to the rainfall patterns, the ratio of annual direct runoff to precipitation was also larger in the last decade. The sediment transport in this decade was consequently larger than the preceding decades. Our data presented here suggest that a close relationship exists between the climate condition, rainfall-runoff response, sediment dynamics, as well as a slowly progressing change of forest condition.

AB This study evaluates seven evapotranspiration models and their performance in water balance studies by using lysimeter measurement data at the Monchengladbach hydrological and meteorological station in Germany. Of the seven evapotranspiration models evaluated, three models calculate actual evapotranspiration directly using the complementary relationship approach, i.e. the CRAE model of Morton, the advection-aridity (AA) model of Brutsaert and Stricker, and the GG model of Granger and Gray, and four models calculate first potential evapotranspiration and then actual evapotranspiration by considering the soil moisture condition. Two of the four potential evapotranspiration models belong to the temperature-based category, i.e. the Thornthwaite model and the Hargreaves model, and the other two belong to the radiation-based category, i.e. the Makkink model and the Priestley-Taylor model. The evapotranspiration calculated by the above seven models, together with precipitation, is used in the water balance model to calculate other water balance components. The results show that, for the calculation of actual evapotranspiration, the GG model and the Makkink model performed better than the other models; for the calculation of groundwater recharge using the water balance approach, the GG model and the AA models performed better; for the simulation of soil moisture content using the water balance approach, four models (GG, Thornthwaite, Makkink and Priestley-Taylor) out of the seven give equally good results. It can be concluded that the lysimeter-measured water balance components, i.e. actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, soil moisture, etc., can be predicted by the GG model and the Makkink model with good accuracy.

AB Excessive groundwater pumping from deep wells in the Bangkok metropolitan area (BMA) since the 1950s has induced piezometric drawdown, land subsidence, and probably remarkable disturbance in confined groundwater flow. To trace the large-scale groundwater flow system in the Lower Central Plain (LCP) of Thailand and to detect its disturbance, we carried out isotopic and hydro-chemical investigations of surface/subsurface waters as well as hydrometric measurements at 98 observation wells. Isotopic compositions of the water (delta D and delta O-18) reflected significant seawater mixing and evaporative enrichment. The Cl/Br mass ratio suggested that halite dissolution is negligible, and spatial distributions of delta and Cl- concentration implied that saline water is mainly remnant seawater. In addition, the delta-Cl relationship indicated that the remnant seawater may have been concentrated in part by transpiration from mangrove forests during delta formation after a period of maximum transgression. The original delta D of the source water was estimated by correcting for the effects of seawater mixing and evaporative enrichment using the Cl- concentration and delta O-18, respectively, and its three-dimensional distribution revealed that the water originating from precipitation over the LCP during the post-glacial age was drawn down to a maximum depth of 240 m by groundwater pumping. At two large depressions in the east and west of the BMA, water recharged during the last glacial age and/or originating at higher elevations outside the LCP is drawn from suburban areas laterally or through underlying aquifers. In contrast, in the central BMA, groundwater within major productive aquifers is mainly replenished by downward leakage across confining layers. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The groundwater flow contribution into Lake Tana was simulated using Gumera River sub-basin as a case study. Draining into Lake Tana, the Gumera sub-basin boundary was delineated from a 90-m Shuttle Radar Terrain Mapping (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) using ArcHydro tools. The sub-basin boundary served as the divide line of the groundwater flow while stream networks were used as internal drainage lines. Input parameters such as transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity were obtained from past studies and experts' knowledge. Based on the geological information of the sub-basin, unconfined subsurface flow condition was considered and simulated using MODular 3D finite difference around-water FLOW model (MODFLOW). Analytical solutions were also used for comparison purposes. The result indicates that head contours are aligned to the streams showing their relationship as a subdued form of the surface water flow, which are dictated by the morphology of the basin. This suggested the need to account groundwater contribution of the sub-basins to Lake Tana as baseflow, and to estimate groundwater inflow from the floodplain separately. The contribution from the floodplain was estimated using a finite differences method which showed an inflow of 0.15 billion cubic meter (BCM) from rivers into the floodplain out of which 0.09 BCM is flowing out to the Lake Tana and 0.06 BCM stored in the aquifers of the floodplain. The stored quantity could meet irrigation demands as well as contribute to the preservation of the ecological structure and function of the area. The study suggests further research on validation of parameters through inverse modeling approaches and optimization of water allocations. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In a water-stressed region, such as the western United States, it is essential to have long lead times for streamflow forecasts used in reservoir operations and water resources management. Current water supply forecasts provide a 3-month to 6-month lead time, depending on the time of year. However, there is a growing demand from stakeholders to have forecasts that run lead times of 1year or more. In this study, a data-driven model, the support vector machine (SVM) based on the statistical learning theory, was used to predict annual streamflow volume with a 1-year lead time. Annual average oceanicatmospheric indices consisting of the Pacific decadal oscillation, North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO), and a new sea surface temperature (SST) data set for the Hondo' region for the period of 19062006 were used to generate annual streamflow volumes for multiple sites in the Gunnison River Basin and San Juan River Basin, both located in the Upper Colorado River Basin. Based on the performance measures, the model showed very good forecasts, and the forecasts were in good agreement with measured streamflow volumes. Inclusion of SST information from the Hondo region improved the model's forecasting ability; in addition, the combination of NAO and Hondo region SST data resulted in the best streamflow forecasts for a 1-year lead time. The results of the SVM model were found to be better than the feed-forward, back propagation artificial neural network and multiple linear regression. The results from this study have the potential of providing useful information for the planning and management of water resources within these basins. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Long-term experimental watershed studies have significantly influenced our global understanding of hydrological processes. The discovery and characterization of how stream water quantity and quality respond to a changing environment (e.g. land-use change, acidic deposition) has only been possible due to the establishment of catchments devoted to long-term study. One such catchment is the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF) located in the headwaters of the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia, a region that provides essential freshwater ecosystem services to eastern and mid-western United States communities. Established in 1934, the FEF is among the earliest experimental watershed studies in the Eastern United States that continues to address emergent challenges to forest ecosystems, including climate change and other threats to forest health. This data note describes available data and presents some findings from more than 50 years of hydrologic research at the FEF. During the first few decades, research at the FEF focused on the relationship between forest management and hydrological processes-especially those related to the overall water balance. Later, research included the examination of interactions between hydrology and soil erosion, biogeochemistry, N-saturation, and acid deposition. Hydro-climatologic and water quality datasets from long-term measurements and data from short-duration studies are publicly available to provide new insights and foster collaborations that will continue to advance our understanding of hydrology in forested headwater catchments. As a result of its rich history of research and abundance of long-term data, the FEF is positioned to continue to advance understanding of forest ecosystems in a time of unprecedented change.

AB Sediments produced from eroding cultivated land can cause on-site and off-site effects that cause considerable economic and social impacts. Despite the importance of soil conservation practices (SCP) for the control of soil erosion and improvements in soil hydrological functions, limited information is available regarding the effects of SCP on sediment yield (SY) at the catchment scale. This study aimed to investigate the long-term relationships between SY and land use, soil management, and rainfall in a small catchment. To determine the effects of anthropogenic and climatic factors on SY, rainfall, streamflow, and suspended sediment concentration were monitored at 10-min intervals for 14years (2002-2016), and the land use and soil management changes were surveyed annually. Using a statistical procedure to separate the SY effects of climate, land use, and soil management, we observed pronounced temporal effects of land use and soil management changes on SY. During the first 2years (2002-2004), the land was predominantly cultivated with tobacco under a traditional tillage system (no cover crops and ploughed soil) using animal traction. In that period, the SY reached approximately 400tkm(-2)year(-1). From 2005 to 2009, a soil conservation programme introduced conservation tillage and winter cover crops in the catchment area, which lowered the SY to 50tkm(-2)year(-1). In the final period (2010-2016), the SCP were partially abandoned by farmers, and reforested areas increased, resulting in an SY of 150tkm(-2)year(-1). This study also discusses the factors associated with the failure to continue using SCP, including structural support and farmer attitudes.

AB The relationship between air (Ta) and water temperature (Tw) is very important because it shows how the temperature of a water body might respond to future changes in surface Ta. Mean monthly Tw records of three gauging stations (Bezdan, Bogojevo i Veliko Gradite) were analysed alongside mean monthly discharge (Q) for the same stations. Additionally, Ta series from two meteorological stations (Sombor and Veliko Gradite) were correlated with Tw variations over the period 1950-2012. Locally weighted scatter point smoothing (LOWESS) was used to investigate long-term trends in the raw data, alongside the Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test. Trend significance was established using Yue-Pilon's pre-whitening approaches to determine trends in climate data. Also, the rescaled adjusted partial sums (RAPS) method was used to detect dates of possible changes in the time series. Statistically significant warming trends were observed for annual and seasonal minimum and maximum Tw at all investigated sites. The strongest warming was observed at Bogojevo gauging station for seasonal maximum Tw, with +0.05 degrees C per year on average. RAPS established that the trend began in the 1980s. This behaviour is linked to climate patterns in the North and East Atlantic which determine the amount of heat advected onto mainland Europe. Statistically significant correlations were found for all Tw on an annual basis. Overall, the strongest correlations (p<0.01) between Tw residuals and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) were recorded for the winter period. These findings suggest possible predictability of Tw over seasonal time-scales. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE Amazon basin; Brazil; hydrology; suspended sediment yield
ID CONTINENTAL-SHELF; RIVER
AB In this paper, we make use of a Brazilian national data set comprising Suspended sediment data for the Amazon region. This contains more than 2500 samples from 60 sites that have been running since the 1970s and are still operated on,in almost quarterly basis. These data provide a valuable basis for assessing Suspended sediment yields in the largest river basin oil earth. We also discuss the sampling procedures and the methods for total suspended sediment (TSS) flux calculation employed in the Amazon region. An analysis of the contribution of the largest Amazon River tributaries to the total sediment load of the Amazon and the relationship between TSS and water discharge has been undertaken. The Brazilian data provide representative information on sediment transport within the basin, particularly for the central flood plain and in the Brazilian and Guiana shields. A basic assessment of the suspended sediment load data highlights the major Andean TSS contribution (more than 1000 10(6) t year(-1)) and the lower contribution from the shield areas (less than 100 10(6) t year(-1)). On the basis of the data from the network of TSS stations, the shield areas are estimated to contribute 7% of the TSS yield from the Amazon River basin. A region of deposition has been identified in the middle of the basin; and the sedimentation rate in the 'varzeas' in the Amazon River basin lowlands has been estimated to be between 3 and 6 mm year(-1).

AB Stream-water temperature is a key variable controlling chemical, biological, and ecological processes in freshwater environments. Most models focus on a single river cross-section; however, temperature gradients along stretches and tributaries of a river network are crucial to assess ecohydrological features such as aquatic species suitability, growth and feeding rates, or disease transmission. We propose SESTET, a deterministic, spatially explicit stream temperature model for a whole river network, based on water and energy budgets at a reach scale and requiring only commonly available spatially distributed datasets, such as morphology and air temperature, as input. Heat exchange processes at the air-water interface are modelled via the widely used equilibrium temperature concept, whereas the effects of network structure are accounted for through advective heat fluxes. A case study was conducted on the prealpine Wigger river (Switzerland), where water temperatures have been measured in the period 2014-2018 at 11 spatially distributed locations. The results show the advantages of accounting for water and energy budgets at the reach scale for the entire river network, compared with simpler, lumped formulations. Because our approach fundamentally relies on spatially distributed air temperature fields, adequate spatial interpolation techniques that account for the effects of both elevation and thermal inversion in air temperature are key to a successful application of the model. SESTET allows the assessment of the magnitude of the various components of the heat budget at the reach scale and the derivation of reliable estimates of spatial gradients of mean daily stream temperatures for the whole catchment based on a limited number of conveniently located (viz., spanning the largest possible elevation range) measuring stations. Moreover, accounting for mixing processes and advective fluxes through the river network allows one to trust regionalized values of the parameters controlling the relationship between equilibrium and air temperature, a key feature to generalize the model to data-scarce catchments.

AB The critical zone features that control run-off generation, specifically at the regional watershed scale, are not well understood. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by quantitatively and conceptually linking regional watershed-scale run-off regimes with critical zone structure and climate gradients across two physiographic provinces in the Southeastern United States. We characterized long-term (20years) discharge and precipitation regimes for 73 watersheds with United States Geological Survey in-stream gaging stations across the Appalachian Mountain and Piedmont physiographic provinces of North Carolina. Watersheds included in this analysis had <10% developed land and ranged in size from 14.1-4,390km(2). Thirty-four watersheds were located in the Piedmont physiographic province, which is typically classified as a low relief landscape with deep, highly weathered soils and regolith. Thirty-nine watersheds were located in the Appalachian Mountain physiographic province, which is typically classified as a steeper landscape with highly weathered, but shallower soils and regolith. From the United States Geological Survey daily mean run-off time series, we calculated annual and seasonal baseflow indices (BFI), minimum, mean, and maximum daily run-off, and Pearson's correlation coefficients between precipitation and baseflow. Our results showed that Appalachian Mountain watersheds systematically had higher minimum daily flows and BFI values. Piedmont watersheds displayed much larger deviations from mean annual BFI in response to year-to-year variability in precipitation. A series of linear regression models between 21 landscape metrics and annual BFIs showed non-linear and complex terrestrial-hydrological relationships across the two provinces. From these results, we discuss how distinct features of critical zone architecture, with specific focus on soil depth and stratigraphy, may be dominating the regulation of hydrological processes and run-off regimes across these provinces.

AB In climate models, the land-atmosphere interactions are described numerically by land surface parameterization (LSP) schemes. The continuing improvement in realism in these schemes comes at the expense of the need to specify a large number of parameters that are either directly measured or estimated. Also, an emerging problem is whether the relationships used in LSPs are universal and globally applicable. One plausible approach to evaluate this is to first minimize uncertainty in model parameters by calibration. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of some model diagnostics using a slightly modified version of the Simple Biosphere 3 model for a variety of biomes located mainly in the Amazon. First, the degree of influence of each individual parameter in simulating surface fluxes is identified. Next, we estimate parameters using a multi-operator genetic algorithm applied in a multi-objective context and evaluate simulations of energy and carbon fluxes against observations. Compared with the default parameter sets, these parameter estimates improve the partitioning of energy fluxes in forest and cropland sites and provide better simulations of daytime increases in assimilation of net carbon during the dry season at forest sites. Finally, a detailed assessment of the parameter estimation problem was performed by accounting for the decomposition of the mean squared error to the total model uncertainty. Analysis of the total prediction uncertainty reveals that the parameter adjustments significantly improve reproduction of the mean and variability of the flux time series at all sites and generally remove seasonality of the errors but do not improve dynamical properties. Our results demonstrate that error decomposition provides a meaningful and intuitive way to understand differences in model performance. To make further advancements in the knowledge of these models, we encourage the LSP community to adopt similar approaches in the future. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Australian and zone ephemeral rivers are typically unregulated and maintain a high level of biodiversity and ecological health. Understanding the ecosystem functions of these rivers requires an understanding of their hydrology. These rivers are typified by highly variable hydrological regimes and a paucity, often a complete absence, of hydrological data to describe these flow regimes. A daily time-step, grid-based, conceptual rainfall-runoff model was developed for the previously uninstrumented Neales River in the and zone of northern South Australia. Hourly, logged stage data provided a record of stream-flow events in the river system. In conjunction with opportunistic gaugings of stream-flow events, these data were used in the calibration of the model. The poorly constrained spatial variability of rainfall distribution and catchment characteristics (e.g. storage depths) limited the accuracy of the model in replicating the absolute magnitudes and volumes of stream-flow events. In particular, small but ecologically important flow events were poorly modelled. Model performance was improved by the application of catchment-wide processes replicating quick runoff from high intensity rainfall and improving the area inundated versus discharge relationship in the channel sections of the model. Representing areas of high and low soil moisture storage depths in the hillslope areas of the catchment also improved the model performance. The need for some explicit representation of the spatial variability of catchment characteristics (e.g. channel/floodplain, low storage hillslope and high storage hillslope) to effectively model the range of stream-flow events makes the development of relatively complex rainfall-runoff models necessary for multisite ecological studies in large, ungauged and zone catchments. Grid-based conceptual models provide a good balance between providing the capacity to easily define land types with differing rainfall-runoff responses, flexibility in defining data output points and a parsimonious water-balance-routing model.

AB Assessing how the infiltration process depends on the water impact energy improves interpretation of hydrological processes. Impact energies vary with the height of water pouring; that is, the distance between the water delivery point and the soil surface. The effects of the height of water pouring on infiltration in an initially near saturated soil can be tested in the field by two repeated Beerkan infiltration runs separated by a short pause (30 min) and using both low (non-perturbing) and high (perturbing) heights of water application. The double two-stage Beerkan run methodology was applied in two soils. The infiltration rate at the end of the perturbing stage of the experiment was 0.2-0.3 (sandy-loam soil) and 0.15 (loam soil) times that obtained with the initial, nonperturbing stage whereas, without any perturbing effect, infiltration rates at the end of the second run were 0.5 times those at the end of the first run. Therefore, the methodology distinguished between a decrease in infiltration rate due to water redistribution during the pause and that attributable to soil surface perturbation. Maintaining a small depth of water (10 mm) on the infiltration surface was not an alternative to the classical Beerkan run for the non-perturbing stage of the experiment since two times higher infiltration rates were measured with a greater hydrostatic pressure. In conclusion, the relationship between infiltration into an initially near saturated soil and the energy of the applied water can be determined directly in the field at any time with a simple and parsimonious experiment. This circumstance could improve soil hydraulic characterization for interpreting and simulating hydrological processes.

AB To investigate the source, flow paths, and chemistry of rich resources of high-quality, shallow groundwater in the alluvial fan between the Tedori and Sai rivers in central Japan, we analysed stable isotope ratios of H, O, and Sr and concentrations of major dissolved ions and trace elements in groundwater, river water, and paddy water. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of the groundwater are related to near-surface geology: groundwater in sediment from the Tedori River has high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (>0.711), whereas that from the Sai River in the north of the fan has low Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (<0.711). H-2 and O-18 values and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios indicate that groundwater in the central and southern fans is recharged by the Tedori River, whereas recharge in the north is from the Sai River. Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, HCO3-, and SO42- concentrations and H-2 and O-18 values in the groundwater are high in the central fan and, except for the northern area, tend to increase with distance from the Tedori River. There are linear relationships between Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio and the reciprocal concentrations of Sr2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. These geochemical characteristics suggest that as groundwater recharged from the Tedori River flows towards the central fan, it mixes with waters derived from precipitation and paddy water that have become enriched in these components during downward infiltration. These results are consistent with our hydrological analysis and numerical simulation of groundwater flow, thus verifying the validity of the model we used in our simulation of groundwater flow.

AB Tamarix elongata Ledeb is a desert shrub found in the desert region of Northwest China and is commonly cultivated as a sand-holding plant in this region. To understand its water requirement and the effects of climate conditions on its growth, trunk xylem sap flows of irrigated 8-year-old Tamarix elongata Ledeb plants were monitored continuously with heat-pulse sap flow meters for the entire season. Soil moisture contents at 0-300 em layer depth were also measured with a tube type time domain reflectometry (Tube-TDR). Meteorological factors, i.e. solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were simultaneously monitored by an automatic weather station at the site. Daily and seasonal variations of the trunk sap fluxes and their correlations with the meteorological factors, reference evapotranspiration and soil moisture contents in the root-zone were analysed. The results indicated that frost influenced the trunk sap flux greatly under irrigated conditions, although the flux generally fluctuated with the variation of environmental factors and showed a mean trunk sap flux of 4.18 1 d(-1). There was a significantly exponential relationship between sap flux and the reference value of crop evapotranspiration, with a correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.7172. The sap flux also had a significant correlation with the soil water contents at a depth of 150-300 cm from soil surface (R-2 = 0.5014). The order of the main meteorological factors affecting the sap flux of Tamarix elongata Ledeb trees was solar radiation > air temperature > vapour pressure deficit > relative humidity > wind speed.

AB Principal components analysis (PCA) is applied to a time series of European Remote Sensing (ERS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes of the Alzette River floodplain (Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg). These images cover markedly different hydrological conditions during several winter seasons in order to enable the examination of the decrease of the radar backscattering signal during drying-up phases following important flood events. At the floodplain scale, with homogeneous land use and constant topography, the first principal components (PCs) are mainly dominated by the variance related to the changing areas. The PCs are thus mainly controlled by subsurface and surface water dynamics. The field observations of a densely equipped piezometric network in the floodplain are used to calculate a mean soil saturation index (SSI) continuously. A classification scheme, based on the PCs and k-means algorithm, leads to the segmentation of the floodplain into several hydrological behaviour classes with distinctive responses versus changing moisture conditions. To validate this classification method with ground-based estimations, the relation between the mean backscattering values of microplots within each PCA-derived hydrological class and the water table measurements, expressed by means of the SSI, is evaluated. Results show that each class of microplots is characterized by the slope of the 'backscattering-SSI' function and by the SSI threshold value at which groundwater resurgence appears. The water ponding implies very low signal return due to the specular backscattering effect on the water surface. Based on established relationships between measured initial water table depths, runoff coefficients and rainfall-induced water table rises, these results are used to discuss the potential of SAR-derived information in flood management applications.

AB A high groundwater level is highly relevant to the slope instability. Drainage tunnel is an effective method for groundwater level control, but its effect on landslide hydrogeological characteristics is rarely discussed. This study analysed the changes of the landslide hydrogeological characteristics under the effect of a drainage tunnel by real-time monitoring of rainfall, groundwater level, and surface displacement. The trend and mutation of groundwater level are analysed by the Mann-Kendall test and the Mann-Kendall mutation test. The memory effect of groundwater in the landslide area was analysed using autocorrelation analysis. The response characteristics of groundwater level to rainfall were evaluated using cross-correlation analysis and mutual information theory. Variations of groundwater levels were further investigated based on hydrograph analysis. Results showed that the groundwater level had a downward trend from 2016 to 2017. The significant downward trend of groundwater levels began in August 2016. The memory effect of groundwater levels was longer under the effect of the drainage tunnel. Before the construction of the drainage tunnel, the response time of groundwater to rainfall was less than 3 hr and rainfall can generate dramatic groundwater level variations. After the drainage tunnel was completed, time lags can be observed in the groundwater response, and the variation of groundwater levels was smaller than before. A strong correlation was found between groundwater levels and the landslide movement. This study demonstrated that the drainage tunnel had effectively controlled the groundwater level in the landslide and ensured the stability of the landslide.

AB A key challenge for resource and land managers is predicting the consequences of climate warming on streamflow and water resources. During the last century in the western United States, significant reductions in snowpack and earlier snowmelt have led to an increase in the fraction of annual streamflow during winter and a decline in the summer. Previous work has identified elevation as it relates to snowpack dynamics as the primary control on streamflow sensitivity to warming. But along with changes in the timing of snowpack accumulation and melt, summer streamflows are also sensitive to intrinsic, geologically mediated differences in the efficiency of landscapes in transforming recharge (either as rain or snow) into discharge; we term this latter factor drainage efficiency. Here we explore the conjunction of drainage efficiency and snowpack dynamics in interpreting retrospective trends in summer streamflow during 19502010 using daily streamflow from 81 watersheds across the western United States. The recession constant (k) and fraction of precipitation falling as snow (Sf) were used as metrics of deep groundwater and overall precipitation regime (rain and/or snow), respectively. This conjunctive analysis indicates that summer streamflows in watersheds that drain slowly from deep groundwater and receive precipitation as snow are most sensitive to climate warming. During the spring, however, watersheds that drain rapidly and receive precipitation as snow are most sensitive to climate warming. Our results indicate that not all trends in western United States are associated with changes in snowpack dynamics; we observe declining streamflow in late fall and winter in rain-dominated watersheds as well. These empirical findings support both theory and hydrologic modelling and have implications for how streamflow sensitivity to warming is interpreted across broad regions.

TI Modeling flash floods in ungauged mountain catchments of China: A

AB Flash floods in small mountain catchments are one of the most frequent causes of loss of life and property from natural hazards in China. Hydrological models can be a useful tool for the anticipation of these events and the issuing of timely warnings. One of the main challenges of setting up such a system is finding appropriate model parameter values for ungauged catchments. Previous studies have shown that the transfer of parameter sets from hydrologically similar gauged catchments is one of the best performing regionalization methods. However, a remaining key issue is the identification of suitable descriptors of similarity. In this study, we use decision tree learning to explore parameter set transferability in the full space of catchment descriptors. For this purpose, a semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model is set up for 35 catchments in ten Chinese provinces. Hourly runoff data from in total 858 storm events are used to calibrate the model and to evaluate the performance of parameter set transfers between catchments. We then present a novel technique that uses the splitting rules of classification and regression trees (CART) for finding suitable donor catchments for ungauged target catchments. The ability of the model to detect flood events in assumed ungauged catchments is evaluated in series of leave-one-out tests. We show that CART analysis increases the probability of detection of 10-year flood events in comparison to a conventional measure of physiographic-climatic similarity by up to 20%. Decision tree learning can outperform other regionalization approaches because it generates rules that optimally consider spatial proximity and physical similarity. Spatial proximity can be used as a selection criteria but is skipped in the case where no similar gauged catchments are in the vicinity. We conclude that the CART regionalization concept is particularly suitable for implementation in sparsely gauged and topographically complex environments where a proximity-based regionalization concept is not applicable.

AB Knowledge about flood generating processes can be beneficial for numerous applications. Especially in the context of climate change impact assessment, daily patterns of meteorological and catchment state conditions leading to flood events (i.e., storylines) may be of value. Here, we propose an approach to identify storylines of flood generation using daily weather and snow cover observations. The approach is tested for and applied to a typical pre-Alpine catchment in the period between 1961 and 2014. Five precipitation parameters were determined that describe temporal and spatial characteristics of the flood associated precipitation events. The catchment's snow coverage was derived using statistical relationships between a satellite-derived snow cover climatology and station snow measurements. Moreover, (pre-) event snow melt sums were estimated using a temperature-index model. Based on the precipitation and catchment state parameters, 5 storylines were identified with a cluster analysis: These are (a) long duration, low intensity precipitation events with high precipitation depths, (b) long duration precipitation events with high precipitation depths and episodes of high intensities, (c) shorter duration events with high or (d) low precipitation intensity, respectively, and (e) rain-on-snow events. The event groups have distinct hydrological characteristics that can largely be explained by the storylines' respective properties. The long duration, high intensity storyline leads to the most adverse hydrological response, namely, a combination of high peak magnitudes, high volumes, and long durations of threshold exceedance. The results show that flood generating processes in mesoscale catchments can be distinguished on the basis of daily meteorological and catchment state parameters and that these process types can explain the hydrological flood properties in a qualitative way. Hydrological simulations of daily resolution can thus be analysed with respect to flood generating processes.

AB This study explored the hydrological impacts of urbanization, rainfall pattern and magnitude in a developing catchment. The Stormwater Management Model was parameterized, calibrated and validated in three development phases, which had the same catchment area (12.3ha) but different land use intensities. The model calibration and validation by using sub-hourly hydro-meteorological data demonstrated a good performance of the model in predicting stormwater runoff in the different development phases. Based on the results, a threshold between minor and major rainfall events was identified and conservatively determined to be about 17.5mm in depth. Direct runoff for minor storm events has a linear relationship with rainfall; however, events with a rainfall depth greater than the threshold yield a rainfall-runoff regression line with a clearly steeper slope. The difference in urban runoff generation between minor and major rainfall events diminishes with the increase of imperviousness. Urbanization leads to an increase in the production of stormwater runoff, but during infrequent major storms, the runoff contribution from pervious surfaces reduces the runoff changes owing to urbanization. Rainfall pattern exerts an important effect on urban runoff, which is reflected in pervious runoff. With the same magnitude, prolonged rainfall events with unvarying low intensity yield the smallest peak flow and the smallest total runoff, yet rainfall events with high peak intensity produce the largest runoff volume. These results demonstrate the different roles of impervious and pervious surfaces in runoff generation, and how runoff responds to rainstorms in urban catchments depends on hyetograph and event magnitude. Furthermore, the study provides a scientific basis of the design guideline sustainable urban drainage systems, which are still arbitrary in many countries. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB More than 40 years of revegetation using mainly Caragana korshinskii at Shapotou Desert Experimental Research Station in China has established a dwarf-shrub and herbaceous cover on the stabilized sand dunes. The evapotranspiration (ET) of the dwarf-shrub C. korshinskii community and the evaporation (E) of the bare soil were measured by the auto-weighing lysimeter method during the growing seasons from 1990 to 1995. The average ET rate was 0.83 mm d(-1) which varied from 0.71 to 1.06 mm d(-1) during the 6-year period. Monthly ET ranged from 0.14 to 2.35 mm d(-1), with a monthly precipitation (P) range of 0 to 3.12 mm d(.)(-1) Monthly ET/P ratios varied from 0.94 to 1.28 and averaged 97.4% overall. Most of the precipitation in this area usually falls between June and September. The lowest precipitation was recorded in 1991, with most of it falling during April and May. This temporal anomaly in the precipitation resulted in the highest ET/P ratio (by 0.33) and soil moisture depletion (DeltaS = -31.5 mm) for the 6-year period. ET from the revegetated sand dunes around Shapotou under natural precipitation may account for 12.2% of the potential evaporation. Cumulative P and cumulative ET and E were highly correlated, with a well-defined linear relationship of ET = 0.80P + 10.0 and E = 0.55P + 5.89, with regression R 2 ranging from 0.953 to 0.985. In 1991, however, the regression equations for both ET and E were considerably different than the other years, with a steeper slope and a negative intercept resulting from the anomaly in the precipitation pattern.

AB Although changes in rainfall characteristics have been noted across the world, few studies have reported those in mountainous areas. This study was undertaken to clarify spatial and temporal variations in rainfall characteristics such as annual rainfall amount (Pr), mean daily rainfall intensity (eta), and ratio of rain days (lambda) in mountainous and lowland areas in Taiwan. To this aim, we examined spatial and year-to-year variations and marginal long-term trends in Pr, eta, and lambda, based on rainfall data from 120 stations during the period 1978-2008. The period mean rainfall ((Pr) over bar) at the lowland stations had strong relationships with the period mean daily rainfall intensity ((eta) over bar) and the period mean ratio of rain days ((lambda) over bar) during those 31 years. Meanwhile, (Pr) over bar was only strongly related to (eta) over bar at mountainous stations, indicating that influences on spatial variations in (Pr) over bar were different between lowland and mountainous stations. Year-to-year variations in Pr at each station were primarily determined from the variation in eta at most stations for both lowland and mountainous stations. Long-term trend analysis showed that Pr and eta increased significantly at 10% and 31% of the total 120 stations, respectively, and lambda decreased significantly at 6% of the total. The increases in Pr were mostly accompanied by increases in eta. Although stations with significant eta increases were slightly biased toward the western lowland area, increases or decreases in Pr and lambda were not common. These results contribute to understanding the impacts of possible climate changes on terrestrial hydrological cycles. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Droughts tend to evolve slowly and affect large areas simultaneously, which suggests that improved understanding of spatial coherence of drought would enable better mitigation of drought impacts through enhanced monitoring and forecasting strategies. This study employs an up-to-date dataset of over 500 river flow time series from 11 European countries, along with a gridded precipitation dataset, to examine the spatial coherence of drought in Europe using regional indicators of precipitation and streamflow deficit. The drought indicators were generated for 24 homogeneous regions and, for selected regions, historical drought characteristics were corroborated with previous work. The spatial coherence of drought characteristics was then examined at a European scale. Historical droughts generally have distinctive signatures in their spatio-temporal development, so there was limited scope for using the evolution of historical events to inform forecasting. Rather, relationships were explored in time series of drought indicators between regions. Correlations were generally low, but multivariate analyses revealed broad continental-scale patterns, which appear to be related to large-scale atmospheric circulation indices (in particular, the North Atlantic Oscillation and the East Atlantic-West Russia pattern). A novel methodology for forecasting was developed (and demonstrated with reference to the United Kingdom), which predicts 'drought from drought'-i.e. uses spatial coherence of drought to facilitate early warning of drought in a target region, from drought which is developing elsewhere in Europe. Whilst the skill of the methodology is relatively modest at present, this approach presents a potential new avenue for forecasting, which offers significant advantages in that it allows prediction for all seasons, and also shows some potential for forecasting the termination of drought conditions.

AB Ground level vapour (GLV) samples were collected at Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India using two methods: liquid condensation (LC) at 0 degrees C and cryogenic trap (CT) at -78 degrees C for the period 2009-2011. The study reveals that there is a considerable fluctuation in stable isotopic composition of GLV throughout the year. The study area receives complex moisture source during different seasons, which is evident from the moisture flux received during different seasons. The isotopic composition of the GLV in both methods shows depleted nature during rainout process. CT method shows exact isotopic signature of GLV because of maximum trapping of air moisture and its condensation, whereas LC method shows depleted or enriched character because of the prevalence of kinetic and diffusive fractionation. The d value shows that LC method acts as magnifier of the CT method and clearly shows seasonal effect than the clustered CT method. Hence, to decipher the original isotopic signature of GLV, isotopic composition of GLV(LC) can be converted to GLV(CT) by deriving an empirical relationship with changing season and locations. Meteorological parameters show varied behaviour with GLV(CT and LC) because of moisture sources in all seasons. The GLV(CT and LC) method shows significant correlation with meteorological parameters when the region is dominated by single moisture source. The GLV(LC) method magnifies the correlation with meteorological parameters when the region is influenced by more than one source. The study shows that the GLV(LC) methods can be used in place of GLV(CT) when the objective is to understand the influence of different moisture sources on GLV.

AB Streambed horizontal hydraulic conductivity (Kh) has a substantial role in controlling exchanges between stream water and groundwater. We propose a new approach for determining Kh of the shallow streambed sediments. Undisturbed sediment samples were collected using tubes that were horizontally driven into streambeds. The sediment columns were analysed using a permeameter test (PT) on site. This new test approach minimizes uncertainties due to vertical flow in the vicinity of test tube and stream stage fluctuations in the computation of the Kh values. Ninety-eight PTs using the new approach were conducted at eight sites in four tributaries of the Platte River, east-central Nebraska, USA. The Kh values were compared with the nondirectional hydraulic conductivity values (Kg) determined from 12 empirical grain-size analysis methods. The grain-size analysis methods used the same sediment samples as Kh tests. Only two methods, the Terzaghi and Shepherd methods, yielded Kg values close to the Kh values. Although the Sauerbrei method produced a value relatively closer to Kh than other nine grain-size analysis methods, the values from this method were not as reliable as the methods of Terzaghi and Shepherd due to the inconsistent fluctuation of the average estimates at each of the test sites. The Zunker, Zamarin, Hazen, Beyer, and Kozeny methods overestimated Kh, while the Slichter, US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), Harleman, and Alyamani and Sen methods underestimated Kh. Any of these specific grain-size methods might yield good estimates of streambed Kh at some sites, but give poor estimates at other sites, indicating that the relationship between Kg and Kh is significantly site dependent in our study.

AB We used a paired-basin approach to examine the impacts of forest harvesting on event-pre-event water partitioning in streamflow and on shallow groundwater residence times during snowmelt in a northern hardwood landscape. The ability of topographic properties to explain spatial variations in groundwater residence times within forested and harvested basins was also explored. Reasonable agreement between isotopic (delta O-18 as tracer) and geochemical (Cl(-)as tracer) hydrograph separation results and good agreement between residence times obtained using the two tracers suggested that Cl- behaves as a conservative tracer in these basins. Geochemical hydrograph separations showed a greater total event-water flux and event-water contribution to peak streamflow from the harvested basin relative to the control 4 years after harvesting. This is consistent with hydrometric and hydrochemical results (Monteith et al., 2006, Hydrological Processes 20: this issue) that indicate surface and near-surface pathways contributed a greater proportion of runoff reaching the stream in the harvested basin, which may reflect increased daily melt rates following harvesting. However, there was no significant difference in mean groundwater residence times between the harvested (18 +/- 16 days) and forested (16 +/- 15 days) basins, and residence times did not exhibit significant differences with depth in either basin. Topographic metrics (topographic index, distance to stream) had a limited relationship with spatial pattems in groundwater residence times, as well as other groundwater properties (Monteith et al., 2006) in both basins. Spatial variations in factors such as near-surface hydraulic conductivity and till thickness should also be considered when explaining observed groundwater behaviour in a basin and its response to forest harvesting during snowmelt.

AB Deciphering the mechanisms through which the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects hydrometeorological parameters in the tropics and extratropics is of great interest. We investigate climatic teleconnections between warm or cold phases of ENSO and streamflow patterns over South Korea using an empirical methodology designed to detect regions showing a strong and consistent hydroclimatic signal associated with ENSO. We calculate not only spatial coherence values by monthly streamflow composite formed over 2-year ENSO cycle and the first harmonic fit to detect candidate regions but also temporal consistency rates by aggregate composite and index time series to determine core regions. As a result, the core regions, namely, the Han river basin and the Nakdong river basin, are detected with a high level of response of ENSO phenomena to streamflow patterns. The ENSO composites for both core regions indicate drier (wetter) conditions in early autumn of the warm (cold) episode years and wetter (drier) conditions from winter to spring of the following year. For both regions, the spatial coherences are over 92% (82%) and the temporal consistencies are 71% (75%) during the El Nino (La Nina) events. In addition, for the core regions identified by composite-harmonic analysis for both extreme episodes, the results of comparative analyses by using correlation, annual cycle, and Wilcoxon rank sum test indicate that 2 opposite phases-streamflow relationships have a tendency of sign reversal of the streamflow anomaly. Also, the positive departures during the El Nino years show more coherent and strong responses than the negative anomalies in the La Nina events. In conclusion, South Korea experiences climatic teleconnection between ENSO forcing and midlatitude streamflow patterns.

AB After several years of decreased annual rainfall and water shortages, the Chilean society is demanding that forest plantations take accountability of their role in consuming scarce water resources. Evidence has shown that interception losses are considerable when determining water production in watersheds. The aim of this study was to determine if site and stand variables explain interception losses by Chilean forests for the development of an empirical model that could predict the potential impacts of forest management practices and land-use change. A total of 127 data from annual water balance plot studies in Chile were compiled to derive relationships between interception and precipitation, species composition, plantation age and other stand and site variables. The reviewed data indicated that annual interception losses are mainly explained by annual rainfall and basal area of the forest stands, with a clear difference between the northern (dryer) and southern (wetter) regions of Chile. For a wide latitudinal gradient, forest composition and age, annual interception accounted for approximately 21% of incoming precipitations. Broadleaved forest stands (including native broadleaved and eucalypt forests) generally presented higher interception losses than conifers. Interception was higher in northern zones, indicating that forests have greater impacts on water resources in dryer regions. Our results were compiled in empirical models, which can be used to estimate forest interception in a latitudinal gradient in Chile and to support policy making. These results are also proposed as an approximate analogue of the changes in forest interception losses, which may occur as vegetation belts shift latitudinally as a result of the impact of climate change.

AB Estimating precipitation frequency is important in engineering, agriculture, land use planning, and many other disciplines. The index flood method alleviates small sample size issues due to short record length by calculating normalized quantile estimates for averaged data from a "region" of gauges. For a perfectly homogeneous region this adds no error; heterogeneity statistics seek to quantify a real-world region's deviation from this assumption. Hosking and Wallis (1997) introduced a Monte Carlo heterogeneity statistic called here H-1 and used a simulation study to assess its utility while rejecting two similar statistics called here H-2 and H-3. A nearly linear relationship was found between Ill and the percentage root mean square error (RMSE) increase due to heterogeneity, establishing H-1 as a "reasonable proxy" of quantile error. The H-1-percent RMSE added relationship found in the simulation experiment was used to find equivalent RMSEs for heterogeneity thresholds against which all three H statistics were tested. In this study the "reasonable proxy" relationship is evaluated across a highly skewed daily precipitation dataset in Minnesota for H-1, H-2 and H-3. Simulated regions used in quantile error estimation are generated using at-site L-moment ratios scaled toward the regional mean with a shrinkage multiplier. A linear relationship is found between Monte Carlo estimates of quantile RMSE and both Ill and Hy across all possible regionalizations of twelve gauges. H-2's relationship is less linear than H-1's as quantified by Pearson's r. A synthetic study is also undertaken using the same sample sizes, regional L-moment averages, and between-site variations as the Hosking and Wallis (1997) simulation. The H-2-percent RMSE added relationship is found to be nearly as linear as for H-1, complementing the enumeration study's findings. Because H-2's linear relationship with percent RMSE added has approximately one-fourth the slope of theH(1) -RMSE relationship, heterogeneity thresholds calculated with reference to H3 should not be applied to H-2. Hy thresholds can be derived from the H2-percent RMSE added relationship in analogous fashion to the method used in Hosking and Wallis (1997) for H-1. The resulting thresholds are one-fourth the magnitude of the H-1 thresholds. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI The probability of breaching water quality standards - A probabilistic
   model of river water nitrate concentrations
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Nitrate; Water quality standards; Bayesian analysis; Binomial regression
ID UNCERTAINTY
AB In this study we propose an approach to predicting the probability that river waters will exceed a water quality standard. The study used a two-part generalised linear modelling approach within a Bayesian framework. Binomial regression was used to model the probability that a water quality standard would be exceeded and included two factors - the difference between sampling sites and difference between years of sampling. Using a Bayesian approach meant that information could be drawn from all observations from all sites, across all years, and that all results would come with a measure of uncertainty. Furthermore, although some known factors could not be included in the binomial regression, they could be included using Bayes' rule to enhance and inform the results. This approach was applied to assessing the probability of nitrate concentrations in English river waters exceeding the current nitrate water quality standard of 11.3 mg N/l. The study showed that the Bayesian approach decreased the measures of uncertainty in the predicted outcomes was reduced by an average of 60% and increased the effective sample size by 64%.The best-fit model had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.9% which equated to an error of +/- 1 sample above the water quality standard for the median site. When interaction of factors could be included, then RMSE decreased to 3.8%. It was not possible to include a diurnal cycle, owing to a paucity of sub-daily sampling, but there was a significant seasonal cycle and so outputs could be adjusted by means of Bayes' rule to predict water quality standard exceedance each month. Comparison with the current method of classification shows no significant difference between five out of the six lowest classifications with only the highest classification being correlated with the estimated exceedence rate. With respect to nitrate in English river waters, the average exceedance rate was 8.3% but was declining at a statistically-significant rate of 0.09%/yr(2).

AB The vegetation growth of the Loess Plateau is often restricted by water, which seriously threatens the water sustainability of regional ecosystem. In order to clarify the relationship between supply and demand of vegetation water use after Grain for Green Project, this study selected Malian River Basin as the research area and calculated the vegetation water use and water demand using the eco-hydrological model. The results showed that the annual water demand of the basin was 570 mm, while the average annual water supply was only 294 mm, accounting only for 52.0% of the demand. From 2000 to 2018, the temporal and spatial matching degree of water supply and demand in the Malian River Basin were 0.63 and 0.65, respectively. On the whole, the water resources in Malian River Basin can basically support the growth of vegetation, but in some areas are not sustainable. Water resources in the southern region can only barely maintain the normal growth of vegetation under the current conditions, so it is not recommended to carry out new plantation in this area. The evaluation of matching degree in the northern from January to April is poor, so it is necessary to appropriately reduce the planting area of economic crops and replace it with planting herbaceous plants with small water consumption in Spring. Compared with the current conditions, under the future climate scenarios of ssp126 and ssp585, the Malian River Basin will show a trend of warming and humidification. The temporal matching degree of water supply and demand also significantly improved to 0.83 and 0.92, indicating that even if the planting structure did not change significantly, water supply would gradually meet the needs of vegetation. The study results can provide the basis for formulating more scientific and reasonable vegetation restoration policies.

AB Stable isotope variability and fractionation associated with transformation of precipitation/accumulation to firn to glacial river water is critical in a variety of climatic, hydrological and paleoenvironmental studies. This paper documents the modification of stable isotopes in water from precipitation to glacier runoff in an alpine catchment located in the central Tibetan Plateau. Isotopic changes are observed by sampling firnpack profiles, glacier surface snow/ice, meltwater on the glacier surface and catchment river water at different times during a melt season. Results show the isotopic fractionation effects associated with glacier melt processes. The slope of the D-O-18 regression line and the deuterium excess values decreased from the initial precipitation to the melt-impacted firnpack (slope from 9.3 to 8.5 and average d-excess from 13.4 parts per thousand to 7.4 parts per thousand). The slope of the D-O-18 line further decreased to 7.6 for the glacier runoff water. The glacier surface snow/ice from different locations, which produces the main runoff, had the same D-O-18 line slope but lower deuterium excess (by 3.9 parts per thousand) compared to values observed in the firnpack profile during the melt season. The D-O-18 regression line for the river water exhibited a lower slope compared to the surface snow/ice samples, although they were closely located on the D-O-18 plot. Isotope values for the river and glacier surface meltwater showed little scatter around the D-O-18 regression line, although the samples were from different glaciers and were collected on different days. Results indicate a high consistency of isotopic fractionation in the D-O-18 relationships, as well as a general consistency and temporal covariation of meltwater isotope values at the catchment scale.

AB This paper focuses mainly on the investigation of water reserve changes in Salt Lake, Turkey, using remote-sensing data. The study is performed in two stages: (1) correlation analysis for real-time ground and satellite data and (2) assessment of water reserve changes using multi-temporal Landsat imagery. First, correlation analysis is conducted to investigate the relationship between digital data from Landsat-5 TM and spectral (in situ) measurements collected using a field spectroradiometer on the same day and time. A radiometric correction procedure, including conversions from digital numbers to radiance and from radiance to at-satellite reflectance, is executed to make satellite data comparable to in situ measurements. This procedure show that simultaneous ground and satellite remote-sensing data are highly correlated (0.84 > R-2 > 97) and the near-infrared region (for this study TM4-Landsat-5 TM, band 4) is the best spectral range to distinguish salt and water on the satellite data for the multi-temporal analysis of the water reserve m Salt Lake. It also shows that the use of shortwave infrared band(s) will result in confusion for the determination of the water reserve in this water-covered study area. In a second and last phase, the water reserve change in the lake is examined using multi-temporal Landsat imagery collected in 1990, 2001 and 2005. The remotely sensed, sampled and treated data show that the water reserve in the lake has decreased markedly between 1990 and 2005 due to drought and uncontrolled water usage. It is Suggested that the use of water supplies around Salt Lake should be controlled and that the lake should regularly be monitored by up-to-date remote-sensing data (at least annually) for better management of water resources.

AB This work provides a comprehensive physically based framework for the interpretation of the north Australian rainfall stable isotope record (O-18 and H-2). Until now, interpretations mainly relied on statistical relationships between rainfall amount and isotopic values on monthly timescales. Here, we use multiseason daily rainfall stable isotope and high resolution (10min) ground-based C-band polarimetric radar data and show that the five weather types (monsoon regimes) that constitute the Australian wet season each have a characteristic isotope ratio. The data suggest that this is not only due to changes in regional rainfall amount during these regimes but, more importantly, is due to different rain and cloud types that are associated with the large scale circulation regimes. Negative (positive) isotope anomalies occurred when stratiform rainfall fractions were large (small) and the horizontal extent of raining areas were largest (smallest). Intense, yet isolated, convective conditions were associated with enriched isotope values whereas more depleted isotope values were observed when convection was widespread but less intense. This means that isotopic proxy records may record the frequency of which these typical wet season regimes occur. Positive anomalies in paleoclimatic records are most likely associated with periods where continental convection dominates and convection is sea-breeze forced. Negative anomalies may be interpreted as periods when the monsoon trough is active, convection is of the oceanic type, less electric, and stratiform areas are wide spread. This connection between variability of rainfall isotope anomalies and the intrinsic properties of convection and its large-scale environment has important implications for all fields of research that use rainfall stable isotopes.

AB There is a need for more isotopic tracer studies at the mesoscale to extend our understanding of catchment transit times and their associated controls beyond smaller experimental sites (typically < 10 km(2)). This paper, therefore, examines the isotope hydrology of six mesoscale (10(1)-10(2) km(2)) sub-catchments of the 2000 km(2) basin of the River Dee in northern Scotland. All the catchments were upland in character (mean altitude > 400 m) with similar suites of soil coverage (predominantly regosols, gleys, peats and podzols), although the relative distribution varied, as did the presence of other landscape features such as aquifers in Quaternary drifts and lakes. Input-output relationships of delta O-18 in precipitation and runoff revealed contrasting responses and differential damping which were broadly consistent with catchment characteristics. The mean transit times (MTTs) were estimated using a convolution integral with a Gamma distribution as the transfer function. These varied from 528 days in the most responsive catchments to > 800 days in catchments where the tracer signature was most damped. Shorter MTTs were found in sub-catchments with a higher percentage cover of responsive soils (i.e. regosols, gleys and peats), whilst sub-catchments with longest MTTs had a higher coverage of free-draining podzolic and alluvial soils, as well as significant amount of stored water either in fluvio-glacial aquifers or large lakes. The MTT of all six catchments had the same order of magnitude; this contrasts with studies in the Scottish Highlands with smaller (< 10 km(2)) catchments where MTT has been shown to vary between 60 and 1200 days.

AB Interception loss has an important influence oil the water yield of forested areas. Nevertheless, in Most Studies stemflow is not measured. therefore the question of how to determine the feasibility of optimizing interception and stemflow parameters simultaneously by matching daily simulated throughfall to fortnightly measurements of cumulative throughfall is an important one. By applying a daily empirical interception model, a goodness fit of 2.2 mm/day is obtained between observed and Simulated cumulative throughfall. However, by applying the simple but robust Linking Test, it was shown that the parameters are non-unique and falsely linked, i.e. inter-relationships between different vegetation parameter sets give similar throughfall but non-unique net precipitation.
   The Linking Test investigates the causes of obtaining falsely linked parameters and shows that objective equifinality is not the Source of the problem. Objective equifinality occurs when all inappropriate objective function is used. The Linking Test also shows that falsely linked parameters are not caused by measuring throughfall on a non-daily basis (termed frequency, sampling equifinality). By expanding the interception model to the second degree, it was found that the non-uniqueness is due to the inherent nature of interception and stemflow functions that behave similarly and therefore can easily compensate each other (termed similarity equifinality).
   It is also shown that a simple daily empirical exponential interception model developed for conifers in the uplands of the United Kingdom is suitable to model interception in Pinus radiata plantations in the Mediterranean climate of Southern Australia by using only daily gross precipitation data and two parameters.

AB This study proposed a spatial information estimation model for the analysis of precipitation gauge networks, to improve on previous methods based on information theory. The proposed model employs a two-dimensional transinformation-distance (T-D) relationship in conjunction with multivariate information approximation to estimate transinformation to ungauged locations from existing stations, while taking into consideration the influence of multiple stations and anisotropy. The proposed model is used to evaluate the spatial distribution of precipitation data and the characteristics of information transfer, which are then applied in a spatial optimization algorithm for the selection of additional station locations. This framework was implemented to investigate temporal and spatial patterns in information content in the Shihmen Reservoir watershed. The results demonstrate obvious anisotropy associated with the delivery of information. By comparing different cases, it was determined that the efficiency of information delivery dominates the spatial distribution of the information content, such that eccentricity is merely supplemental. Efficiency in information delivery is also heavily influenced by temporal scale. For data covering long intervals (monthly and annual), efficiency in the delivery of information is relatively high, while the uncertainty or heterogeneity of hourly or daily time series produces low spatial correlations due to the inefficient delivery of information. The proposed spatial optimization algorithm confirmed that the optimal location for new stations lies close to the center of low information zones. Additional stations could improve information content considerably; however, the margin of improvement decreases with the number of stations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Open-water perennial pools are common natural features of peatlands globally, and peatland restoration often results in new pool creation, yet the concentrations of different forms of aquatic carbon (C) in natural and artificial restoration pools are not well studied. We compared carbon concentrations in both natural pools and restoration pools (4-15 years old) on three blanket peatlands in northern Scotland. At all sites, restoration pools were more acidic and had mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in restoration pools of 23, 22, and 31 mg L-1 compared with natural pool means of 11, 11 and 15 mg L-1 respectively across the three sites. Restoration pools had a greater fulvic acid prevalence than the natural pools and their DOC was more aromatic. Restoration pools were supersaturated with dissolved CO2 at around 10 times atmospheric levels, whereas for natural pools, CO2 concentrations were just above atmospheric levels. Dissolved CH4 concentrations were not different between pool types, but were similar to 200 times higher than atmospheric levels. Regular sampling at one of the peatland sites over 2.5 years showed that particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations were generally below 7 mg L-1 except during the warm, dry summer of 2013. At this regularly-sampled site, natural pools were found to process DOC so that mean pool outflow concentrations in overland flow were significantly lower than mean inflow DOC concentrations. Such an effect was not found for the restoration pools. Soil solution and pool water chemistry, and relationships between DOC and CO2 concentrations suggest that different processes are controlling the transformation of C, and therefore the form and amount of C, in natural pools compared to restoration pools.

AB The 20 km(2) Galabre catchment belongs to the French network of critical zone observatories (OZCAR; Gaillardet et al., Vadose Zone Journal, 2018, 17(1), 1-24). It is representative of the sedimentary lithology and meteorological forcing found in Mediterranean and mountainous areas. Due to the presence of highly erodible and sloping badlands on various lithologies, the site was instrumented in 2007 to understand the dynamics of suspended sediments (SS) in such areas. Two meteorological stations including measurements of air temperature, wind speed and direction, air moisture, rainfall intensity, raindrop size and velocity distribution were installed both in the upper and lower part of the catchment. At the catchment outlet, a gauging station records the water level, temperature and turbidity (10 min time-step). Stream water samples are collected automatically to estimate SS concentration-turbidity relationships, allowing quantification of SS fluxes with known uncertainty. The sediment samples are further characterized by measuring their particle size distributions and by applying a low-cost sediment fingerprinting approach using spectrocolorimetric tracers. Thus, the contributions of badlands located on different lithologies to total SS flux are quantified at a high temporal resolution, providing the opportunity to better analyse the links between meteorological forcing variability and watershed hydrosedimentary response. The set of measurements was extended to the dissolved phase in 2017. Both stream water electrical conductivity and major ion concentrations are measured each week and every 3 h during storm events. This extension of measurements to the dissolved phase will allow progress in understanding both the origin of the water during the events and the partitioning between particulate and dissolved fluxes of solutes in the critical zone. All data sets are available at .

AB Diffuse sources of sediment and sediment-associated nutrients are of increasing environmental concern because of their impacts on receiving water courses. The aim of the research reported here was to monitor the outflow from four field (land) drains at two farms in the English Midlands in order to estimate the quantity of sediment delivered to the local rivers and the most likely sources and processes involved. A multiparameter sediment unmixing model was employed, using environmental magnetic, geochemical and radionuclide tracers in order to determine the most likely origin of sediments transported through the drains. Results demonstrated that there was a generally linear relationship between drainflow sediment loss and drainflow volume and that the majority (>70%) of the sediment exported from the drains was derived from topsoil. Macropore flow through heavily cracked soils is supported by the data to be the most likely means of sediment delivery to the drains. In one catchment, drains contributed over 50% of the annual sediment budget. Spatial and temporal variations in the sources of sediment reaching one drain outlet were investigated in detail. A link between soil moisture deficit (SMD) and the frequency of high-intensity rainfall events was used to explain the appearance and persistence of a new sediment source in this drain after October 1998. It is concluded that field drains have the potential to be significant conduits of sediment and agrochemicals in a wide variety of environments in the UK. It is also suggested that this potential may increase if projected climate change leads to more intense rainfall events and increases in SMD across a greater area of the UK.

AB Computing the monthly and winter water balance for cold regions can be difficult due to data scarcity. Historically, the spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and the number of variables measured have been limited. Currently, these data are once again becoming limited. To estimate the net snowpack accumulation, measured precipitation must be adjusted to consider precipitation underestimation due to gauge undercatch, the snow lost to sublimation, and blowing snow transport. Using existing formulations, hourly meteorological data were used to estimate snowpack sublimation and blowing snow transport losses for three winters at six National Weather Service (NWS) automated surface observation stations across the coterminous USA. Wind-induced undercatch was estimated from daily data for the collocated NWS Alter-shielded gauges. For the average wind speed sites (the average wind speed was from 2.4 to 4.3 m s(-1)), 70% of the snow that fell was caught, whereas at the low wind site (1.3 m s(-1)), 90% was caught and only 46% was caught at the high wind site (5.6 m s(-1)). Average snowpack sublimation ranged from 7 mm per month at either low wind or low precipitation sites to over 20 mm per month at average wind sites with either average precipitation and low humidity or high precipitation and moderate humidity. Blowing snow transport was only important at higher wind sites (>4 m s(-1)). A distinct relationship was not obvious for average monthly meteorology for undercatch versus snowpack sublimation plus blowing snow losses. Seasonally, they are approximately equal for more snowy and wet environments. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper presents a steady-state analytical hillslope, stability model to study the role of topography on rain-induced shallow landslides. We combine a bivariate continuous function of the topographic surface, a steady-state hydrological model of hillslope saturated storage. and the infinite slope stability assumption to investigate the interplay between terrain characteristics, saturated storage within hillslopes and soil mechanics. We demonstrate the model by examining the stability of nine characteristic hillslope types (landform, elements) with three different profile curvatures (concave, straight and convex) and three different plan shapes (convergent, parallel and divergent). For each hillslope type, the steady-state saturated storage corresponding to given recharge rates is computed for three different average bedrock slope angles. On the basis of the infinite slope stability method, the factor of safety (FS) along the hillslopes is determined. Our results demonstrate that in the steep slopes, the least stable situation occurs in hillslopes with convergent plan shapes and concave length profiles, while the convex ones are more stable. In addition to testing our method for nine characteristic hillslope types, a general relationship between plan shape and profile curvature of landform elements and the factor of safety is derived for a pre-defined hillslope length scale. Our results show that slope stability increases when profile curvature changes from concave to convex. In terms of plan shapes, changing from convergent to divergent, slope stability increases for all length profiles. However, we find that the effect of plan shape is more pronounced for convex length profiles. Overall, we demonstrate that, in addition to bedrock slope, hillslope shape as represented by plan shape and profile curvature is an important control on hillslope stability.

ID MODEL
AB Stream temperature is a complex function of energy inputs including solar radiation and latent and sensible heat transfer. In streams where groundwater inputs are significant, energy input through advection can also be an important control on stream temperature. For an individual stream reach, models of stream temperature can take advantage of direct measurement or estimation of these energy inputs for a given river channel environment. Understanding spatial patterns of stream temperature at a landscape scale requires predicting how this environment varies through space, and under different atmospheric conditions. At the landscape scale, air temperature is often used as a surrogate for the dominant controls on stream temperature. In this study we show that, in regions where groundwater inputs are key controls and the degree of groundwater input varies in space, air temperature alone is unlikely to explain within-landscape stream temperature patterns. We illustrate how a geologic template can offer insight into landscape-scale patterns of stream temperature and its predictability from air temperature relationships. We focus on variation in stream temperature within headwater streams within the McKenzie River basin in western Oregon. In this region, as in other areas of the Pacific Northwest, fish sensitivity to summer stream temperatures continues to be a pressing environmental issue. We show that, within the McKenzie, streams which are sourced from deeper groundwater reservoirs versus shallow subsurface flow systems have distinct summer temperature regimes. Groundwater streams are colder, less variable and less sensitive to air temperature variation. We use these results from the western Oregon Cascade hydroclimatic regime to illustrate a conceptual framework for developing regional-scale indicators of stream temperature variation that considers the underlying geologic controls on spatial variation, and the relative roles played by energy and water inputs.

AB Isotope signatures in precipitation from the Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation around the Mediterranean basin and literature data are compared with isotopic data from a large karstic aquifer in southeast Spain to explain the origin and type of the precipitation events dominating recharge. Analysis of the deuterium excess d at the scale of the Mediterranean basin and at the regional scale allows us to understand the isotopic context of the study area: Campo de Dalias and the Sierra de Gador (Almerfa province). The origin of precipitation can be determined from its d value. The d value changes as a function of the initial evaporation condition. It depends on the relative humidity and temperature during the evaporation producing the water vapour of the clouds. The water vapour, which dominates the study area, is generated in two areas: the Atlantic Ocean (d = 10 parts per thousand) and the western Mediterranean basin (d = 15 parts per thousand). With increasing precipitation volume, the western Mediterranean character dominates. These heavier storms contribute mainly to recharge, as illustrated by the d value of 13.6 parts per thousand in deep groundwater of the Campo de Dalias. Weighted d values increase with the volume of precipitation, giving a significant relationship for the southern and eastern coasts of the Iberian Peninsula. This selectivity of d to monthly precipitation was used to estimate the return period of precipitation leading to aquifer recharge at 0.9-4.9 years. Moderate rainfall, which occurs more frequently, still represents similar to 60-90% of the total precipitation. One of the challenges to meet ever-growing water demands is to increase recharge from moderate events yielding intermediate quantities per event, but forming the bulk of the annual precipitation.

AB This paper discusses the relationship between the differentiation of ferruginous accumulations and the variable water saturation of footslope soil patterns. An analysis of the slope morphology of a typical hill in the forest zone of southern Cameroon and a seasonal survey of the levels of groundwaters, springs and rivers were considered in relation to the petrology of different soil patterns. The study site is a tabular hillock whose slopes present a progressive development from steep to gentle slopes. The variable residence time of water within the soil, creating an alternation of reducing and oxidizing conditions, affects oil chemistry, structure and lateral extension of the soil patterns. The ferruginous soil patterns, being formed on the footslopes, gradually increase in extent with decreasing slope angle and the relative rise of the groundwater level. The steep footslopes, where groundwater has a shorter residence time, show a soft mottled clay pattern, restricted to the bottom part of the slope. The moderate footslopes exhibit a deep permanent and a temporary perched groundwater table. The latter, with its regular capillary fringe, contributes to more reducing conditions within isolated domains in the soil patterns, and thus to the alternation with oxidizing conditions, generating a continuous hard soil pattern (massive carapace). The more gently dipping footslopes exhibit groundwater levels near the surface and also a significant amplitude of groundwater fluctuation. Iron, previously accumulated in moderate footslope patterns, is reduced, remobilized, and leached. The soil patterns formed develop into a variegated carapace, more extended along the slope, containing less iron, but nevertheless more hardened, due to the important fluctuations of the groundwater table. These patterns are limited to the zone of groundwater fluctuation and deteriorate as the water fluctuation zone recedes. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Vegetation structure and density affect the dynamics of snow accumulation and ablation. Vegetation also affects our ability to estimate snow-covered area accurately from satellite-based sensors. The objective of this case study is to demonstrate how the angular pattern of reflectance from vegetation over snow can provide information on forest cover density. Imagery from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer was acquired over north-central Colorado on 15 February 2002. Angular reflectance data were extracted from a variety of image locations and were analysed in conjunction with a digital elevation model and maps of forest cover density and forest cover type. The Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete semi-empirical parametric model was successfully used to simulate the angular patterns of reflectance. The model's k parameter, a measure of reflectance anisotropy, was used to characterize the angular signatures of selected pixels. Results show distinct patterns of anisotropic reflectance that depend on density and cover type. Non-forested areas exhibit a bowl-shaped pattern (k < 1.0) of reflectance versus viewing angle. Low-density deciduous forests also have this bowl-shaped reflectance pattern, but this changes as the density increases. Other forest cover types show transitional patterns between bowl and bell shapes and distinct bell-shaped patterns (k > 1.0) for higher densities. However, the relationship between k and density does not hold for forest cover densities that approach 100%. For a density of 99%, the fir-spruce forest cover type has a distinct bowl shape and a k value of only 0.69. This is in agreement with previous work indicating that sub-pixel homogeneity (whether because of sparse vegetation cover or extremely dense vegetation cover) will result in k < 1.0. This preliminary study indicates from a qualitative standpoint that multi-angle reflectance data captures sub-pixel-scale information on forest cover density. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Hydrologic models are simplified representations of natural hydrologic systems. Since these models rely on assumptions and simplifications to capture some aspects of hydrological processes, calibration of parameters is unavoidable. However, utilizing the philosophy of a recent modelling framework proposed by Bahremand (2016), we show how calibration of most model parameters can be avoided by allocating or presetting these parameters utilizing knowledge gained from sensitivity analyses, field observations and a priori specifications as a part of a parameter allocation procedure. This paper details the simulation of daily river flow of the Shemshak-Roudak watershed performed using the Python version of the WetSpa model. The WetSpa-Python model is a distributed model of hydrological processes applied at the watershed scale. The model was applied to the Shemshak-Roudak watershed of Iran with parameter allocation. Model calibration involved only two parameters. Straightforward methods were proposed for allocating model parameters, including three baseflow-related parameters and the determination of maximum active groundwater storage using a mass curve technique. Also, the Budyko curve was used to constrain a correction factor for potential evapotranspiration. The WetSpa-Python model was extended to include the influence of snowmelt. A failure to include snow in the hydrological processes of the WetSpa-Python model creates a significant discrepancy between the observed and simulated hydrographs during the spring. The results of daily simulations for 12 years (2002-2014) are in good agreement with observations of discharge (Kling-Gupta Efficiency = 0.84). These results demonstrate that it is feasible to simulate hydrographs with limited calibration given a knowledge of hydrological processes and an understanding of relationships between catchment characteristics and model parameters.

AB Soil water content is a key variable for biogeochemical and atmospheric coupled processes. Its small-scale heterogeneity impacts the partitioning of precipitation (e.g., deep percolation or transpiration) by triggering threshold processes and connecting flow paths. Forest hydrologists frequently hypothesized that throughfall and stemflow patterns induce soil water content heterogeneity, yet experimental validation is limited. Here, we pursued a pattern-oriented approach to explore the relationship between net precipitation and soil water content. Both were measured in independent high-resolution stratified random designs on a 1-ha temperate mixed beech forest plot in Germany. We recorded throughfall (350 locations) and stemflow (65 trees) for 16 precipitation events in 2015. Soil water content was measured continuously in topsoil and subsoil (210 profiles). Soil wetting was only weakly related to net precipitation patterns. The precipitation-induced pattern quickly dissipates and returns to a basic pattern, which is temporally stable. Instead, soil hydraulic properties (by the proxy of field capacity) were significantly correlated with this stable soil water content pattern, indicating that soil structure more than net precipitation drives soil water content heterogeneity. Also, both field capacity and soil water content were lower in the immediate vicinity of tree stems compared to further away at all times, including winter, despite stemflow occurrence. Thus, soil structure varies systematically according to vegetation in our site. We conclude that enhanced macroporosity increases gravity-driven flow in stem proximal areas. Therefore, although soil water content patterns are little affected by net precipitation, the resulting soil water fluxes may strongly be affected. Specifically, this may further enhance the channelling of stemflow to greater depth and beyond the rooting zone.

AB The numerous lakes on the Tibetan Plateau play an important role in the regional hydrological cycle and water resources, but systematic observations of the lake water balance are scarce on the Tibetan Plateau. Here, we present a detailed study on the water cycle of Cona Lake, at the headwaters of the Nujiang-Salween River, based on 3 years (2011-2013) of observations of delta O-18 and delta H-2, including samples from precipitation, lake water, and outlet surface water. Short-term atmospheric water vapor was also sampled for isotope analyses. The delta H-2-delta O-18 relationship in lake water (delta H-2 = 6.67 delta O-18 - 20.37) differed from that of local precipitation (delta H-2 = 8.29 delta O-18 + 12.50), and the deuterium excess (d-excess) in the lake water (-7.5%) was significantly lower than in local precipitation (10.7%), indicating an evaporative isotope enrichment in lake water. The ratio of evaporation to inflow (E/I) of the lake water was calculated using both d-excess and delta O-18. The E/I ratios of Cona lake ranged from 0.24 to 0.27 during the 3 years. Observations of atmospheric water vapor isotopic composition (dA) improved the accuracy in E/I ratio estimate over a simple precipitation equilibrium model, though a correction factor method provided nearly identical estimates of E/I ratio. The work demonstrates the feasibility of d-excess in the study of the water cycle for lakes in other regions of the world and provides recommendations on sampling strategies for accurate calculations of E/I ratio.

AB Soil water storage and stable isotopes dynamics were investigated in dominant soil-vegetation assemblages of a wet northern headwater catchment (3.2km(2)) with limited seasonality in precipitation. We determined the relative influence of soil and vegetation cover on storage and transmission processes. Forested and non-forested sites were compared, on poorly drained histosols in riparian zones and freely draining podzols on steeper hillslopes. Results showed that soil properties exert a much stronger influence than vegetation on water storage dynamics and fluxes, both at the plot and catchment scale. This is mainly linked to the overall energy-limited climate, restricting evaporation, in conjunction with high soil water storage capacities. Threshold behaviour in runoff responses at the catchment scale was associated with differences in soil water storage and transmission dynamics of different hydropedological units. Linear input-output relationships occurred when runoff was generated predominantly from the permanently wet riparian histosols, which show only small dynamic storage changes. In contrast, nonlinear runoff generation was related to transient periods of high soil wetness on the hillslopes. During drier conditions, more marked differences in soil water dynamics related to vegetation properties emerged, in terms of evaporation and impacts on temporarily increasing dynamic storage potential. Overall, our results suggest that soil type and their influence on runoff generation are dominant over vegetation effects in wet, northern headwater catchments with low seasonality in precipitation. Potential increase of subsurface storage by tree cover (e.g. for flood management) will therefore be spatially distributed throughout the landscape and limited to rare and extreme dry conditions.

AB The Climatic Redistribution of western Canadian Water Resources project was designed to identify regions of increased/decreased water availability by evaluating a suite of atmospheric, hydroclimatic and streamflow variables. This research component focuses on the atmospheric drivers of air temperature and precipitation in the watersheds originating on the leeward slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Dominant winter (November-April) synoptic-scale mid-tropospheric circulation patterns from 1950 to 2011 are classified using self-organizing maps, and frequency distributions for positive/negative phases of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Arctic Oscillation are statistically compared. Corresponding high-resolution gridded temperature and precipitation anomalies are calculated for each synoptic type, and spatial patterns of above/below-average temperature and precipitation and north/south gradients are identified. Gridded 6-month values of the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index are also used to categorize winters into regions of high/low snowpack. Results indicate high-pressure ridges over the Pacific Ocean (western North America), and low-pressure troughs over western North America (Pacific Ocean) are associated with anomalously cool (warm) and wet (dry) conditions in the study region. Several statistically different synoptic type frequencies were found for positive/negative phases of the SOI, PDO and Arctic Oscillation. Most notably, positive (negative) phases of the SOI and negative (positive) phases of the PDO are associated with a higher (lower) frequency of ridging over the Pacific Ocean (western North America). Through improved knowledge of the relationships between teleconnections, mid-tropospheric circulation and surface climate, the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources in western Canada is better understood.

AB Elevated turbidity (T-n) and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) during and following flood events can degrade water supply quality and aquatic ecosystem integrity. Streams draining glacially conditioned mountainous terrain, such as those in the Catskill Mountains of New York State, are particularly susceptible to high levels of T-n and SSC sourced from erosional contact with glacial-related sediment. This study forwards a novel approach to evaluate the effectiveness of stream restoration best management practices (BMPs) meant to reduce stream T-n and SSC, and demonstrates the approach within the Stony Clove sub-basin of the Catskills, a water supply source for New York City. The proposed approach is designed to isolate BMP effects from natural trends in T-n and SSC caused by trends in discharge and shifts in average T-n or SSC per unit discharge (Q) following large flood events. We develop Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs) to quantify how T-n-Q and SSC-Q relationships change over time at monitoring stations upstream and downstream of BMPs within the Stony Clove and in three other sub-basins without BMPs, providing observational evidence of BMP effectiveness. A process-based model, the River Erosion Model, is then developed to simulate natural, hydrology-driven SSC-Q dynamics in the Stony Clove sub-basin (absent of BMP effects). We use DLMs to compare the modelled and observed SSC-Q dynamics and isolate the influence of the BMPs. Results suggest that observed reductions in SSC and T-n in the Stony Clove sub-basin have been driven by a combination of declining streamflow and the installed BMPs, confirming the utility of the BMPs for the monitored hydrologic conditions.

AB How to quantify the impact of climate change and human activities on groundwater is not only a hot topic of current research but also a key point of water resource management in arid irrigated areas. Therefore, this paper analyzes the changes in the trends of land use, climate, and groundwater extraction in the Yanqi Basin in recent years and uses the distributed hydrological model MIKE-SHE to quantitatively analyze the impacts of these three factors on groundwater resources. The results show that: 1. The Nash coefficients of the simulated and observed groundwater levels during the verification period are 0.84, 0.79 and 0.76; the correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed soil moisture is 0.86. Although there are some uncertainties in the simulation, the results prove that the model can be used to simulate arid irrigated areas. 2. The effects of these three factors on groundwater levels are 5, 12.5 and 82.5%, respectively, and have caused the regional average groundwater level to decrease by a maximum of 0.07, 0.23 and 1.79 m, respectively. The effects of these three factors on the interactions between surface water and groundwater were 7.04, 3.63 and 89.33%. Groundwater extraction has become the main influencing factor of regional groundwater resources changes due to its more direct influence. 3. The influence of groundwater extraction has a strong spatial distribution characteristic and 10% of the study area has been greatly impacted by the groundwater extraction. Base on the above results, integrating multidisciplinary knowledge to establish the relationship between ecological environment and groundwater changes can provide strategies for the sustainable development of groundwater.

AB Stream water temperature (t(s)) is a critical water quality parameter for aquatic ecosystems. However, t(s) records are sparse or nonexistent in many river systems. In this work, we present an empirical model to predict t(s) at the site scale across the USA. The model, derived using data from 171 reference sites selected from the Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow database, describes the linear relationship between monthly mean air temperature (t(a)) and t(s). Multiple linear regression models are used to predict the slope (m) and intercept (b) of the t(a)-t(s) linear relation as a function of climatic, hydrologic and land cover characteristics. Model performance to predict t(s) resulted in a mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0.78 across all sites. Application of the model to predict t(s) at additional 89 nonreference sites with a higher human alteration yielded a mean Nash-Sutcliffe value of 0.45. We also analysed seasonal thermal sensitivity (m) and found strong hysteresis in the t(a)-t(s) relation. Drainage area exerts a strong control on m in all seasons, whereas the cooling effect of groundwater was only evident for the spring and fall seasons. However, groundwater contributions are negatively related to mean t(s) in all seasons. Finally, we found that elevation and mean basin slope are negatively related to mean t(s) in all seasons, indicating that steep basins tend to stay cooler because of shorter residence times to gain heat from their surroundings. This model can potentially be used to predict climate change impacts on t(s) across the USA. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Minor changes to seasonal air temperature and precipitation can have a substantial impact on the availability of water resources within large watersheds. Two such watersheds, the north-flowing Mackenzie and east-flowing Saskatchewan Basins, have been identified as highly vulnerable to such changes and, therefore, selected for study as part of the Climatic Redistribution of western Canadian Water Resources project. This project aims to evaluate spatial and temporal changes to water resource distribution through the analysis of a suite of hydroclimatic and streamflow variables. As part of this analysis, dominant summer (May-October) circulation patterns at 500 hPa for 1950-2011 are identified using the method of self-organizing maps. Surface climate variables associated with these patterns are then identified, including both daily air temperature and precipitation and seasonal Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index values. Statistical methods are applied to assess the relationships between dominant circulation patterns and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Results indicate that mid-summer (July-August) is dominated by a split-flow blocking pattern, resulting in cool (warm), wet (dry) conditions in the southern (northern) portion of the study area. By contrast, the shoulder season (May and October) is dominated by a trough of low pressure over the North Pacific Ocean. The frequency of weak split-flow blocking is higher during positive SOI and negative PDO, whereas ridging over the western continent is more frequent during negative SOI and positive PDO. Results from this analysis increase our knowledge of processes, controlling the distribution of summer water resources in western Canada. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Discharge time series' are one of the core data sets used in hydrological investigations. Errors in the data mainly occur through uncertainty in gauging (measurement uncertainty) and uncertainty in determination of the stage-discharge relationship (rating curve uncertainty). Thirty-six flow gauges from the Namoi River catchment, Australia, were examined to explore how rating curve uncertainty affects gauge reliability and uncertainty of observed flow records. The analysis focused on the deviations in gaugings from the rating curves because standard (statistical) uncertainty methods could not be applied. Deviations of greater/lesser than 10% were considered significant to allow for a measurement uncertainty threshold of 10%, determined from quality coding of gaugings and operational procedures. The deviations in gaugings were compared against various factors to examine trends and identify major controls, including stage height, date, month, rating table, gauging frequency and quality, catchment area and type of control. The analysis gave important insights into data quality and the reliability of each gauge, which had previously not been recognized. These included identification of more/less reliable periods of record, which varied widely between gauges, and identification of more/less reliable parts of the hydrograph. Most gauges showed significant deviations at low stages, affecting the determination of low flows. This was independent of the type of gauge control, with many gauges experiencing problems in the stability of the rating curve, likely as a result of sediment flux. The deviations in gaugings also have widespread application in modelling, for example, informing suitable calibration periods and defining error distributions. This paper demonstrates the value and importance of undertaking qualitative analyses of observed records. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Most precipitation in watersheds is consumed by evaporation, thus techniques to appraise regional evaporation are important to assess the availability of water resources. Many algorithms to estimate evaporation from remotely sensed spectral data have been developed in the recent past, in addition to differences in the physical parameterization of surface fluxes, these algorithms have different solutions for describing spatial variations of the parameters in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) continuum. In this study, the necessity to spatially distinguish SVAT parameters for computing surface heat fluxes is analysed thr the Naivasha watershed in the Kenyan Rift Valley. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral data have been used to first delineate the watershed into 15 hydrological units using surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index and surface albedo as attributes. Thereafter, semi-empirical relationships between these TM-based parameters and other SVAT parameters have been applied to compute the spatial variation of SVAT parameters and the associated evaporation from the different hydrological units. The impact of using watershed-constant or watershed-distributed SVAT parameters on the fluxes is analysed. The determination of watershed averaged evaporation with area-aggregated SVAT parameters is feasible without significant loss of accuracy. Distributed evaporation in heterogeneous watersheds, however, can be investigated only with remote sensing flux algorithms that can account for spatially variable air temperature, surface roughness, surface albedo and the stability correction of the temperature profile due to buoyancy. Erroneous results can be expected if area-aggregated SVAT parameters are used to calculate local evaporation. As most of the recently developed remote sensing flux algorithms are based on areal constant SVAT parameters, direct applications in watersheds are still limited.

AB Soil CO2 flux is strongly influenced by precipitation in many ecosystem types, yet knowledge of the effects of precipitation on soil CO2 flux in semi-arid desert ecosystems remains insufficient, particularly for sandy soils. To address this, we investigated the response of sandy soil CO2 flux to rainfall pulses in a desert ecosystem in northern China during August-September 2011. Significant changes (P<0.05) were found in diel patterns of soil CO2 flux induced by small (2.1mm), moderate (12.4mm) and large (19.7mm) precipitation events. Further analysis indicated that rainfall pulses modified the response of soil CO2 flux to soil temperature, including hysteresis between soil CO2 flux and soil temperature, with F-s higher when T-s was increasing than when T-s was decreasing, and the linear relationship between them. Moreover, our results showed that rainfall could result in absorption of atmospheric CO2 by soil, possibly owing to mass flow of CO2 induced by a gradient of gas pressure between atmosphere and soil. After each precipitation event, soil CO2 flux recovered exponentially to pre-rainfall levels with time, with the recovery times exhibiting a positive correlation with precipitation amount. On the basis of the amounts of precipitation that occurred at our site during the measurement period (August-September), the accumulated rain-induced carbon absorption evaluated for rainy days was 1.068gCm(-2); this corresponds approximately to 0.5-2.1% of the net primary production of a typical desert ecosystem. Thus, our results suggest that rainfall pulses can strongly influence carbon fluxes in desert ecosystems. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Water temperature is an important determinant of the growth and development of malaria mosquito immatures. To gain a better understanding of the daily temperature dynamics of malaria mosquito breeding sites and of the relationships between meteorological variables and water temperature, three clear water pools (diameter x depth: 0.16 x 0.04, 0.32 x 0.16 and 0-96 x 0.32 in) were created in Kenya. Continuous water temperature measurements at various depths were combined with weather data collections from a meteorological station. The water pools were homothermic, but the top water layer differed by up to about 2 degrees C in temperature, depending on weather conditions. Although the daily mean temperature of all water pools was similar (27.4-28.1 degrees C) the average recorded difference between the daily minimum and maximum temperature was 14.4 degrees C in the smallest versus 7.1 degrees C in the largest water pool. Average water temperature corresponded well with various meteorological variables. The temperature of each water pool was continuously higher than the air temperature. A model was developed that predicts the diurnal water temperature dynamics accurately, based on the estimated energy budget components of these water pools. The air-water interface appeared the most important boundary for energy exchange processes and on average 82-89% of the total energy was gained and lost at this boundary. Besides energy loss to longwave radiation, loss due to evaporation was high; the average estimated daily evaporation ranged from 4.2 mm in the smallest to 3.7 mm in the largest water pool.

AB Twenty five laboratory dissolution experiments have been conducted to quantify rates of solute acquisition, measured as Ca2+ concentration against time, from glacigenic sediments suspended in cold, dilute waters. Suspended sediment character was constrained by field-calibrated ranges of both concentration in meltwater (g cm(-3)) and specific surface area by sediment mass (cm(2) g(-1)). This constraint yielded, for the first time in a glacier hydrochemical study, dissolution rate data as a function of the specific sediment surface area by water volume (cm(2) cm(-3)). The resulting experimental data are used to calibrate a kinetic dissolution model, where the rate of solute acquisition is considered in terms of three parameters: an initial concentration C-0, reflecting rapid ion-exchange reactions; an ultimate steady-state concentration C-s; and a rate parameter k. Results indicate an excellent fit between the laboratory-measured Ca2+ concentrations and model output, with goodness-of-fit, expressed as chi(2) reducing in all cases to less than 1.7 x 10(-14) following iterative curve fitting for each experiment. Plotting the resulting best-fit equation parameters against specific surface area by water volume reveals a strong positive relationship for both C-0 and C-s, respectively yielding straight-line slopes of 4.2 x 10(-8) (R-2 = 0.88) and 1.2 x 10(-7) (R-2 = 0.77). However, k was found to be insensitive to changes in specific surface area by water volume (R-2 = 0.00), largely reflecting the dominance of variability in C-0 and C-s in this model.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important part of the hydrological cycle, significantly influencing water distribution, energy cycle, and plant growth. In the context of global warming and acceleration of the water cycle, it is of great significance to analyse the trend and attribution of ET on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is most a sensitive and vulnerable area of the world. In this article, ET products, obtained from the improved Penman-Monteith-Leuning model with 1 km spatial resolution and 8 days temporal resolution, were used to investigate the trend and attribution of modelled ET and its components on the TP during the 2003-2017 period. The modelling results show the ET, soil evaporation (E), and vegetation transpiration (T) present a highly similar spatial pattern, with a distinct decreasing gradient from the humid southeastern areas to the arid northwestern areas of the plateau. In terms of its components, E (269 mm yr(-1)) contributes about 70% of ET (385 mm yr(-1)), especially in the northwestern region. Although the relationship between ET and elevation is not clear, the results showed that E increased with elevation, while T exhibited the opposite trend. At the same time, approximately 80% of the grids showed an increasing trend (increasing at a rate of 4.7 mm yr(-1)), mainly concentrated in the southeastern area, where the increased ET in forests and alpine meadows was the most obvious. Variations of modelled ET on the TP is distinguished into energy-restricted and water-restricted regions, corresponding respectively to the eastern region affected by temperature, and the western region controlled by soil moisture. The results of the present study can greatly improve our understanding of the hydrological cycle and the ability to manage water resources on the TP within the context of global climate change.

AB Large proportions of rainwater and snowmelt infiltrate into the subsurface before contributing to stream flow and stream water quality. Subsurface flow dynamics steer the transport and transformation of contaminants, carbon, weathering products and other biogeochemistry. The distribution of groundwater ages with depth is a key feature of these flow dynamics. Predicting these ages are a strong test of hypotheses about subsurface structures and time-varying processes. Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-based groundwater ages revealed an unexpected groundwater age stratification in a 0.47 km(2) forested catchment called Svartberget in northern Sweden. An overall groundwater age stratification, representative for the Svartberget site, was derived by measuring CFCs from nine different wells with depths of 2-18 m close to the stream network. Immediately below the water table, CFC-based groundwater ages of already 30 years that increased with depth were found. Using complementary groundwater flow models, we could reproduce the observed groundwater age stratification and show that the 30 year lag in rejuvenation comes from return flow of groundwater at a subsurface discharge zone that evolves along the interface between two soil types. By comparing the observed groundwater age stratification with a simple analytical approximation, we show that the observed lag in rejuvenation can be a powerful indicator of the extent and structure of the subsurface discharge zone, while the vertical gradient of the age-depth-relationship can still be used as a proxy of the overall aquifer recharge even when sampled in the discharge zone. The single age stratification profile measured in the discharge zone, close to the aquifer outlet, can reveal the main structure of the groundwater flow pattern from recharge to discharge. This groundwater flow pattern provides information on the participation of groundwater in the hydrological cycle and indicates the lower boundary of hydrological connectivity.

AB Potential future changes in lake physical processes (e.g. stratification and freezing) can be assessed through exploring their sensitivity to climate change, and assessing the current vulnerability of different lake types to plausible changes in meteorological drivers. This study quantifies the impacts of climate change and sensitivity of lake physical processes within a large (5100km(2)) Precambrian Shield catchment in south-central Ontario. Historic regional relationships are established between climate drivers, lake morphology, and lake physical changes through generalized linear modelling (GLM), and are used to quantify likely changes in timing of ice phenology and lake stratification across 72 lakes under a range of future climate models and scenarios. In response to projections of increased temperature (ensemble mean of +3.3 degrees C), both earlier ice-off and onset of summer stratification were projected, with later ice-on and fall turnover compared to the baseline. Process sensitivity to climate change varied by lake type; shallower lakes with a smaller volume (less than 15m deep and less than 0.05km(3)) were more sensitive to processes associated with lake heating (stratification onset and ice-off), and deeper lakes with a larger surface area (greater than 30m deep and greater than 1000ha) were more sensitive to processes associated with lake cooling (fall turnover and ice-on). These results indicate that whereas small lakes are vulnerable to climate warming because of changes that occur in spring and summer, larger lakes are particularly sensitive during the fall. The findings suggest that lake morphology and associated sensitivity should be considered in the development of sustainable lake management strategies. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Studies on hydrology, biogeochemistry, or mineral weathering often rely on assumptions about flow paths. water storage dynamics, and transit times. Testing these assumptions requires detailed hydrometric data that are usually unavailable at the catchment scale. Hillslope studies provide an alternative for obtaining a better understanding. but even on such well-defined and delimited scales, it is rare to have a comprehensive set of hydrometric observations from the water divide down to the stream that can constrain efforts to quantify water storage, movement, and turnover time. Here, we quantified water storage with daily resolution in a hillslope during the course of almost an entire year using hydrological measurements at the study site and an extended version of the vertical equilibrium model. We used an exponential function to simulate the relationship between hillslope discharge and water table; this was used to derive transmissivity profiles along the hillslope and map mean pore water velocities in the saturated zone. Based on the transmissivity profiles, the soil layer transmitting 99% of lateral flow to the stream had a depth that ranged from 8.9 m at the water divide to under 1 m closer to the stream. During the study period, the total storage of this layer varied from 1189 to 1485 mm, resulting in a turnover time of 2172 days. From the pore water velocities, we mapped the time it would take a water particle situated at any point of the saturated zone anywhere along the hillslope to exit as runoff. Our calculations point to the strengths as well as limitations of simple hydrometric data for inferring hydrological properties and water travel times in the subsurface.

ID RECESSIONS
AB Daily outflow frequencies and recession curves were used to identify differences in storage-outflow relationships between two different drainage systems, conventional and controlled drainage. A three-year (1996-1999) field drainage experiment was carried out on a loamy sand soil in southern Sweden. Plots with an area of 0.2 hectares were drained by conventional subsurface drainage (CD) or by controlled drainage (CWT1 and CWT2). The controlled drainage system allowed the groundwater level in the soil to be varied during the year. It was kept at least 70 cm below the soil surface during the growing season but allowed to rise to a maximum of 20 cm below the soil surface during the rest of the year. Measurements were performed to record precipitation, drain outflow and groundwater levels. Daily values of outflow were divided into 10 categories, based on the size of outflow. Recession curves of hourly measurement of outflow were selected. They behaved like single reservoirs and a linear storage-outflow model was applied. Least squares estimates of the parameters initial outflow, initial storage volume and retention constant were calculated.
   Controlled drainage had a significant effect on total drain outflow and outflow pattern during the three years of measurement. The total drain outflow was 70% to 90% smaller in CWT than in CD. The analysis revealed that the initial outflows were higher, the retention constant and the temporary storage lower in CWT. The hydrological impacts of the reduction in temporary storage were higher peak flow, shorter lag time and shorter recession time and these effects increased with an increased groundwater level.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Distributed hydrological models can make predictions with much finer spatial resolution than the supporting field data. They will, however, usually not have a predictive capability at model grid scale due to limitations of data availability and uncertainty of model conceptualizations. In previous publications, we have introduced the Representative Elementary Scale (RES) concept as the theoretically minimum scale at which a model with a given conceptualization has a potential for obtaining a predictive accuracy corresponding to a given acceptable accuracy. The new RES concept has similarities to the 25-year-old Representative Elementary Area concept, but it differs in the sense that while Representative Elementary Area addresses similarity between subcatchments by sampling within the catchment, RES focuses on effects of data or conceptualization uncertainty by Monte Carlo simulations followed by a scale analysis. In the present paper, we extend and generalize the RES concept to a framework for assessing the minimum scale of potential predictability of a distributed model applicable also for analyses of different model structures and data availabilities. We present three examples with RES analyses and discuss our findings in relation to Beven's alternative blueprint and environmental modeling philosophy from 2002. While Beven here addresses model structural and parameter uncertainties, he does not provide a thorough methodology for assessing to which extent model predictions for variables that are not measured possess opportunities to have meaningful predictive accuracies, or whether this is impossible due to limitations in data and models. This shortcoming is addressed by the RES framework through its analysis of the relationship between aggregation scale of model results and prediction uncertainties and for considering how alternative model structures and alternative data availability affects the results. We suggest that RES analysis should be applied in all modeling studies that aim to use simulation results at spatial scales smaller than the support scale of the calibration data.

AB Groundwater responses at 15 monitoring wells on Jeju Island were observed in relation to the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku Earthquake off the Pacific coast of Honshu, Japan, on 11 March 2011, at 14:46:23 h local time (05:46:24 h UTC time). In coastal areas, the groundwater level responses to the earthquake were oscillatory at 12 wells, and the range of the maximum groundwater level changes was 3192.4cm. The response durations were approximately 162 min. The relationship between the maximum groundwater level changes and the response durations displayed a high correlation coefficient (r=0.81). Groundwater temperature changes were also observed at 7 of 12 wells 310 min after the seismic wave arrived, and the range was from 0.01 degrees C to 1.20 degrees C. In mid-elevation areas, the groundwater level changes appeared in three different forms: oscillatory, spiky and persistent. The groundwater temperature changes were also observed at two wells. One indicated decreasing and recovering temperatures, and the other exhibited rising and persistent temperatures. The primary temperature changes occurred 56 min after the earthquake and 23 min after the seismic wave arrived. In addition, the electrical conductivities at the depth of the transition zone were monitored, and the responses to the earthquake appeared at all three wells. Although the electrical conductivity and temperature changes were not well understood, groundwater inflow and mixing were likely caused by the earthquake, and the responses were various and site specific. The responses to the earthquake were closely related to the hydrogeological characteristics at each monitoring well, and a more detailed hydrogeological characterization is needed to understand the mechanisms related to earthquakes in general.

AB Sediment plays a pivotal role in determining the physical, chemical and biological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. A range of factors influences the impacts of sediment pressures on aquatic biota, including concentration, duration of exposure, composition and particle size. In recognition of the need to assess environmental status for sediment and mitigate excessive sediment pressures on aquatic habitats, both water column and river substrate metrics have been proposed as river sediment targets. Water column metrics include light penetration, turbidity, sediment concentration summary statistics and sediment regimes. Substrate metrics include embeddedness, the fredle index and riffle stability. Identification of meaningful numeric targets along these lines has, however, been undermined by various issues including the uncertainty associated with toxicological dose-response profiles and the impracticalities of deploying statistically robust sampling strategies capable of supporting catchment-scale targets. Many of the thresholds reported are based on correlative relationships that fail to capture the specific mechanisms controlling sediment impacts on aquatic habitats and are stationary in nature. Temporal windows represented by the key life stages of specific species must be given greater emphasis. Given such issues and the need to support the revision of sediment targets for river catchment management, it is proposed that greater emphasis should be placed on developing generic modelling toolkits with the functionality for coupling current or future projected sediment regimes with biological response for a range of biota. Such tools should permit the identification of river catchment-specific targets within a national context, based on biological effect and incorporate sufficient flexibility for utilizing updated physical, chemical, biological and catchment attribute data. Confidence will continue to be required in compliance screening to ensure cost-effective management programmes for avoiding disproportionate investment in impacted river catchments.

AB Predicting soil loss is necessary to establish soil conservation measures. Variability of soil and hydrological parameters complicates mathematical simulation of soil erosion processes. Methods for predicting unit plot soil loss in Sicily were developed by using 5 years of data from replicated plots. At first, the variability of the soil water content, runoff, and unit plot soil loss values collected at fixed dates or after an erosive event was investigated. The applicability of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was then tested. Finally, a method to predict event soil loss was developed. Measurement variability decreased as the mean increased above a threshold value but it was low also for low values of the measured variable. The mean soil loss predicted by the USLE was lower than the measured value by 48%. The annual values of the soil erodibility factor varied by seven times whereas the mean monthly values varied between 1% and 244% of the mean annual value. The event unit plot soil loss was directly proportional to an erosivity index equal to Q(R)R(c)(1.609), being Q(R)R(c) the runoff ratio times the single storm erosion index. It was concluded that a relatively low number of replicates of the variable of interest may be collected to estimate the mean for both high and particularly low values of the variable. The USLE with the mean annual soil erodibility factor may be applied to estimate the order of magnitude of the mean soil loss but it is not usable to estimate soil loss at shorter temporal scales. The relationship for estimating the event soil loss is a modified version of the USLE-M, given that it includes an exponent for the Q(R)R(e) term. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A drainage basin's runoff response can be determined by the connectivity of generated runoff to the stream network and the connectivity of the downstream drainage network. The connectivity of a drainage basin modulates its ability to produce streamflow and respond to precipitation events and is a function of the complex and variable storage capacities throughout the drainage basin and along the drainage network. An improved means to measure and account for the dynamics of stream network connectivity at the catchment scale is needed to predict basin scale streamflow. At a 150 km(2) subarctic Precambrian Shield catchment where the poorly drained heterogeneous mosaic of lakes, exposed bedrock, and soil filled areas creates variable contributing areas, hydrological connectivity was measured in 11 sub-basins with a particular focus on three representative sub-basins. The three sub-basins, although of similar relative size, vary considerably in the dominant typology and topology of their constituent elements. At a 10-m spatial resolution, saturated areas were mapped using both multispectral satellite imagery and onsite measurements of storage according to land cover. To measure basin-scale hydrological connectivity, the drainage network was represented using graph theory where stream reaches are 'edges' connecting sub-basin 'nodes'. The overall hydrological connectivity of the stream network was described as the ratio of actively flowing relative to potentially flowing stream reaches. The hydrological connectivity of the stream network to the outlet was described as the ratio of actively flowing stream reaches that were connected to the outlet to the potentially flowing stream reaches. Hydrological connectivity was then related to daily average streamflow and basin runoff ratio. Improved understanding of causal factors for the variable streamflow response to runoff generation in this environment will serve as a first step towards improved streamflow prediction in formerly glaciated landscapes, especially in small ungauged basins.

The experiments were conducted in a laboratory flow tank where various (inland and coastal) head changes were imposed to the system and the response of the key seawater intrusion parameters was analysed with high spatial and temporal resolution. Two homogeneous aquifer systems of different grain size were tested. The numerical code SEAWAT was used for the validation. The results show that in cases of sea-level variations, the intruding wedge required up to twice longer time to reach a new steady-state condition than the receding wedge, which thereby extend the theory of timescale asymmetry between saltwater intrusion and retreat processes in scenarios involving sea-level fluctuations. The intruding and receding rates of the saltwater wedge were respectively similar in the scenario involving sea-level and the freshwater-level changes, despite change in transmissivity. The results show that, during the intrusion phase, the transition zone remains relatively insensitive, regardless of where the boundary head change occurs (i.e., freshwater drop or sea-level rise) or its magnitude. By contrast, a substantial widening of the transition zone was observed during the receding phase, with almost similar amplitude in the scenario involving a rise of the freshwater level compared with that caused by a drop of the saltwater level, provided that an equivalent absolute head change magnitude was used. This transition zone widening (occurring during saltwater retreat) was greater and extended over longer period in the low hydraulic conductivity aquifer, for both freshwater-level rise and sea-level drop scenarios. The concentration maps revealed that the widening mechanism was also enhanced by the presence of some freshwater sliding and into the wedge during saltwater retreat, which was thereafter sucked upward towards the interface because of density difference effects.

AB In a subtropical mountain of northern Mexico. soils and slopes seem to have a hortonian functioning, as it is commonly observed in other tropical or subtropical areas. So it is important to know previous soil moisture before any rainfall event in order to properly estimate the runoff coefficients and to get a better understanding of the hydrologic behaviour of the catchments.
   A very simple deterministic model, named NAZASM, is developed and tested for 6 microplots (1 and 10 m(2)), 13 plots (50 m(2)) and 5 catchments (1-50 km(2)). It is based on the 'antecedent precipitation index' with an exponential decay parameter (a) into the rainfall-runoff relationship, Measurements of rainfall and runoff were made during four rainy seasons. Between 22 and 157 rain events were considered in the analysis. depending on the sizes of the plots and catchments.
   'NAZASM' gives reasonable estimations of runoff if the calibration data set includes events occurring during wet and dry years. due to the difference of hydrological processes involved in these two situations.
   All the results have shown that the use of such a model significantly improves the explained variances between measured runoff and rainfall as compared to classical regression analysis whatever the size of plots and catchments are.
   The alpha soil water content decay parameter which in theory is a soil characteristic. appeared in fact to be scale dependent. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding rainfall-runoff processes is crucial for prevention and prediction of water-related natural disasters. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a potential tracer, but few researches have applied it for rainfall-runoff process studies. We observed multiple tracers including SF6 in spring water at 1- to 2-hr intervals during rainstorm events to investigate the effectivity of SF6 tracer in rainfall-runoff studies through the clarification of rainfall-runoff process. The target spring is a perennial spring in a forested headwater catchment with an area of 0.045 km(2) in Fukushima, Japan. The relationship between the SF6 concentration in spring water and the spring discharge volume was negative trend; the SF6 concentration in spring water becomes low as the spring discharge volume increases especially during rainstorms. The hydrograph separation using SF6 and chloride ion tracers was applied for determining the contribution of principal sources on rainfall-runoff water. It suggested more than 60% contribution of bedrock groundwater at the rainfall peak and high percentage contribution continued even in the hydrograph recession phase. Based on observed low SF6 concentration in groundwater after heavy rainfall, the replacement of groundwater near the spring with bedrock groundwater is indicated as a mechanism for water discharge with low SF6 concentration during rainfall events. Consequently, rainstorm events play an important role as triggers in discharging water stored in the deeper subsurface area. In addition, SF6 tracer is concluded as one of the strongest tracers for examining rainfall-runoff process studies. And, therefore, this study provided new insights into the dynamics of groundwater and its responses to rainfall in terms of SF6 concentration variance in water in headwater regions.

AB We report the results of a detailed study of dissolved Sr isotopes in the Solimoes and Beni-Madeira Rivers of the Amazon basin. This study developed data collected over 8years indicating large spatial and temporal variations in dissolved Sr isotopes among the rivers of the Amazon basin. The large Sr-87/Sr-86 variations were found to be correlated with the geology of the source areas of the suspended sediments. The Beni-Madeira River displays a high average Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio and large Sr-87/Sr-86 fluctuations during the hydrological cycle. This large average value and fluctuations were related to the presence of Precambrian rocks and Ordovician sediments in the source area of the suspended sediment of the river. In contrast, the Solimoes River displays a narrow range of Sr isotope ratio variations and an average value close to 0.709. This river drains mostly Phanerozoic rocks of northern Peru and Ecuador that are characterized by low Sr isotope ratios. The isotopic fluctuations in the Beni-Madeira River were observed to propagate downstream at least as far as bidos. This signal is characterized by an inverse relationship between the concentration of elemental Sr and its isotopic ratios. We further demonstrate that the Sr isotopic composition and content in the Beni-Madeira River is controlled by suspended sediments derived from the Andes. Despite draining areas underlain by Precambrian rocks and having high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, such rivers as the Negro and Tapajos play a minor role in the total Sr budget of the Amazon basin.

AB Flash floods are one of the most severe natural disasters throughout the world, and are responsible for sizeable social and economic losses, as well as countless injuries and death. Risk assessment, which identifies areas susceptible to flooding, has been shown to be an effective tool for managing and mitigating flash floods. The study aims to introduce the methods to determine the weights of the risk indices, and identify the different risk clusters. In this regard, we proposed a methodology for comprehensively assessing flash flood risk in a GIS environment, by the improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) method, and an integration of iterative self-organizing data (ISODATA) analysis and maximum likelihood (ISO-Maximum) clustering algorithm. The weight for each risk index is determined by the IAHP, which integrates the subjective characteristics with objective attributes of the assessment data. Based on the data mining technology, the integration of ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm derives a more reasonable classification. The Guangdong Province of China was selected for testing the proposed method's applicability, and we used a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve approach to validate the modeling of the flash-flood risk distribution. The validation against the historical flash flood data indicates a high reliability of this method for comprehensive flash flood risk assessment. In order to verify the proposed method's superiority, in addition, the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the weights-of-evidence (WE) methods are used for comparison with the IAHP and ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm method. Moreover, we analyzed and compared the regularity of flash floods in the rural and urban areas. This study not only provides a new approach for large-scale flash flood comprehensive risk assessment, but also assists researchers and local decision-makers in designing flash flood mitigation strategies.

AB In this paper, we develop diagnostic methods to assess spatial variability in hydrological processes, particularly those relevant to catchment modelling. We target a range of catchment responses, including runoff volume, runoff timing, storage-discharge relationships, and threshold responses to rainfall and soil moisture. The diagnostics allow us to map the scales and patterns of process variability, to test whether climate or physical catchment characteristics can be used to predict patterns in processes, and to explore the implications for appropriate spatial variability in hydrological model structures or parameters.
   We apply the diagnostic tests to the mid-sized (50km(2)) Mahurangi catchment in Northland, New Zealand, combining data from 28 flow gauges, 13 rain gauges, and 18 soil moisture measurement sites to build a comprehensive description of spatial variation in catchment response. The results show a complex picture: different diagnostics reveal different patterns of hydrological processes, and large variations in processes occur, even over the short length scales involved (similar to 10km). Catchment and climate characteristics almost all show the same pattern, i.e. that subcatchments in the far North and South of the Mahurangi are similar to each other (higher elevation, steep, forested), but contrast with central subcatchments (lower elevation, shallower slopes, pasture). Surprisingly, this pattern is not reflected in the patterns of diagnostic indices, demonstrating the difficulty of defining realistic a priori estimates of spatial variability in processes. We discuss how process variations correspond to the design of components of a simple lumped conceptual model. In the Mahurangi catchment, we find that spatial variations in multiple aspects of the hydrological response imply a need for spatial variation in both model structures and parameters.

AB The obvious decline in stream flow to the Biliu River reservoir over the period 1990-2005 has raised increasing concerns. Climate change and human activities, which mainly include land use changes, hydraulic constructions and artificial water consumption, are considered to be the most likely reasons for the decline in stream flow. This study centres on a detailed analysis of the runoff response to changes in human activities. Using a distributed hydrological model, (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), we simulated runoffs under different human activity and climate scenarios to understand how each scenario impacts stream flow. The results show that artificial water consumption correlates with the precipitation (wet, normal and dry) of the year in question and is responsible for most of the decrease in runoff during each period and for each different wetness year. A Fuzzy Inference Model is also used to find the relationship between the precipitation and artificial water consumption for different years, as well as to make inferences regarding the future average impact on runoff. Land use changes in the past have increased the runoff by only a small amount, while another middle reservoir (Yunshi) has been responsible for a decrease in runoff since operation began in 2001. We generalized the characteristics of the human activities to predict future runoff using climate change scenarios. The future annual flow will increase by approximately 10% from 2011 to 2030 under normal human activities and future climate change scenarios, as indicated by climate scenarios with a particularly wet year in the next 20years. This study could serve as a framework to analyse and predict the potential impacts of changes both in the climate and human activities on runoff, which can be used to inform the decision making on the river basin planning and management.

AB A field study site was installed in east-central Pennsylvania to examine processes controlling groundwater recharge. It was instrumented to monitor climatic inputs, soil water dynamics and groundwater response. Characterization of the layered fractured bedrock underlying the site by rock coring, seismic surveys and interval packer testing showed consistencies between layer depths, fracture frequencies, seismic velocities and hydraulic conductivities. Monthly summaries of rainfall and percolate over two years showed that percolate rates were generally high and closely related to precipitation during the dormant season. During the growing season, however, the relationship became erratic with large variabilities: occurring between individual lysimeter measurements. Eight dormant season rainfall events were examined in detail. Smaller events produced similar responses from 1 m deep percolate lysimeters, Approximately 10-15 mm of rain was required to initiate percolate, with the time delay in response dependent on how long it took this depth to accumulate; 5 to 6 mm of the rain was retained in storage, with the remainder becoming percolate. Larger rains, from 30-110 mm, caused correspondingly larger depths of percolate and larger water table responses, but generally similar patterns of site response. Groundwater at the site was typically about 6 m below the land surface during the dormant season. It responded 1-2 hours after the onset of percolate, and reached its maximum elevation anywhere from 4 to 16 hours after that, even though percolate was still-occurring, Based on causative depth of recharge and amount of water level rise in wells, the specific yield of the aquifer was found to be of the order of 0.01. This value is characteristic of fracture geometry rather than matrix properties of the bedrock. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A surface area/volume relationship was used to estimate total glacier volumes for the highly glacierized Hector Lake Basin (281 km(2)) in the Canadian Rockies in the years 1951 and 1993. The change in volume was calculated and this value then extrapolated up to the Bow Basin at Banff (2230 km(2)) based on relative proportions of glacier cover. The mean net glacier volume loss estimate of 934 x 10(6) m(3) was divided into annual proportions of glacier wastage and storage using a local mass balance record collected at Peyto Glacier in the Mistaya Valley, contiguous to the Bow Basin. Unfortunately, the record began in 1966 and a hind-cast to 1952 (hydrological year) was necessary. Banff maximum summer temperature and Lake Louise snow course data were used as surrogates for summer and winter glacier mass balance, respectively. Monthly wastage proportions were estimated for 1967-1974 by using modelled values of glacial melt as a template. Glacier wastage inputs to and storage held back from the Bow River hydrograph at Banff were compared with known basin yields to assess the hydrological effects of glacier volume change. For 1952-1993, the average annual wastage/basin yield ratio was found to be around 1.8%. For the extremely low flow year of 1970 this ratio increased to 13%. The proportion of flow derived from glacier wastage in August of this year was estimated to be around 56%. Although the results tend to confirm the regulatory effect of glaciers on stream flow, it was found that in some years of low flow this situation has been aggravated by water being held in glacial storage.

AB The relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding temperature is of great importance for predicting precipitation extremes in the future, given the rapid increase of global warming. This study investigates the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature over mainland China based on the China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (CMADS). The relationship between extreme precipitation and daily maximum temperature before rainfall as well as that between relative humidity and daily mean temperature is investigated. The results show that (1) Among the patterns of the relationship between extreme precipitation and corresponding daily mean temperature, the peak pattern is dominant over mainland China, accounting for 95.80% of all the patterns; (2) a scaling of extreme precipitation with daily mean temperature greater than that represented by the C-C scaling is observed in most parts of China; (3) the peak-point extreme precipitation decreases from the southeast to the northwest of China, whereas the peak-point temperature ranges from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C; (4) for most regions of China, the decreases in the relative humidity and the cooling effect of heavy extreme precipitation and its synoptic system contribute to the peak or negative pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature; and (5) compared with the cooling effect, the decrease of relative humidity is the first-order reason for the peak or negative pattern of the relationship between extreme precipitation and the corresponding daily mean temperature.

AB Fractured geological media are complex systems where hydrodynamic parameters are highly variable as result of their structure. Indeed, measured parameters depend on the scale and the implemented methodologies. with high variability of hydrodynamic parameters. This variableness also depends on the scale of measurement. Most theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media adding uncertainty to the fractured media hydrogeological characterization. In fractured media, the complexity is even harder to characterize as available theoretical frameworks assume homogeneous media. Nevertheless, the increase of underground engineering projects and their reported impacts on surface and groundwater resources claim efforts to a better understanding of fractured media groundwater hydrodynamics. In this work, we propose a general approach for the scale-dependence of the hydraulic conductivity based on power law concepts. To do so, the hydraulic conductivity field of a highly fractured massif in the Colombian Andes is estimated over scales from 6 cm to 12 km. Laboratory measurements, re-analyzes of hydraulic tests, and calibration of 3D numerical models were performed, using the La Linea tunnels (in Colombia) as real scale laboratory. Hydraulic conductivity values vary up to four orders of magnitude at each characteristic length scale and show an increase until the local scale, followed by a small decrease at regional scale. In this way, field and regional scales display the same orders of magnitude. Finally, the scale-dependence of the hydraulic conductivity values based on power law concepts is proposed. As a consequence, it suggests the possibility to use field data in regional models, once hydrogeological units and structures are properly defined.

ID PARAMETERS
AB This study presents a grid-based modification of the HBV model concept and four regionalisation approaches using widely available catchment characteristics in the meso-scale Neckar catchment. The HBV model was adapted to allow for the simulation of catchment runoff and daily groundwater recharge in a high spatial discretisation. The resulting large number of model parameters requires the use of a regionatisation method which also ensures consistent parameter estimation. Therefore, in the first approach, functional relationships between catchment characteristics and model parameters have been defined a priori. These established relationships were used to calibrate the model by modifying the parameters of the transfer functions instead of the model parameters themselves. The results are compared to relationships derived from simultaneously calibrated model parameters constrained to form a function of catchment characteristics by a modification of the Lipschitz condition, a monotony condition and a combination of both constraints. Through this reduction of the available parameter space for optimisation, the problem of equifinality is avoided which often results in weak regression relationships between model parameters and catchment characteristics. The methodology is demonstrated using six subcatchments of the Neckar basin to set up the relationships and 51 other subcatchments to evaluate its performance. All four methods were able to produce reasonable parameter sets for most of the regionatisation catchments. As expected, all four methods failed to reproduce the observed discharge in karstic areas and in heavily modified or regulated river basins, which indicates their sensitivity to catchment characteristics. The modified Lipschitz condition produced the most efficient simulations of observed discharges in the regionalisation at the cost of some inconsistencies in the physical interpretation of the resulting relationships. The monotony condition preserved the assumed trends in the functions between celt properties and model. parameters but produced sharp jumps which are not considered plausible. The combination of both methods seems to be the most promising because it produced equally good regionatisation results with much more consistent regression relationships. The approach can reproduce derived trends and the resulting relationships match our understanding of how the underlying processes are represented in the model. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dyes are important hydrological tracers. Many different dyes have been proposed as optimal tracers, but none of these dyes can be considered an ideal water tracer. Some dyes are toxic and most sorb to subsurface materials. The objective of this study was to find the molecular structure of an optimal water tracer. We used QSAR to screen a large number of hypothetical molecules, belonging to the class of triarylmethane dyes, in regard to their sorption characteristics to a sandy soil. The QSAR model was based on experimental sorption data obtained from four triarylmethane dyes: C.I. Food Blue 2 (C.I. 42090; Brilliant Blue FCF), C.I. Food Green 3 (C.I. 42053; FD&C Green No. 3), C.I. Acid Blue 7 (C.I. 42080; ORCOacid Blue A 150%), and C.I. Acid Green 9 (C.I. 42100; ORCOacid Fast Green B). Sorption characteristics of the dyes to the sandy soil were expressed with the Langmuir isotherm. Our premise was that dye sorption can be reduced by attachment of sulfonic acid (SO3) groups to the triarylmethane template. About 70 hypothetical dyes were created and QSAR were used to estimate sorption characteristics. The results indicated that both the position and the number Of SO3 groups affected dye sorption. Sorption decreased with increasing number of SO3 groups attached to the molecule. Increasing the number of sulfonic acid groups also decreases the toxicity of the compounds. An optimal triarylmethane water tracer contains 4 to 6 SO3 groups. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation plays a significant role in the isotopic fractionation of rainwater during rainfall partitioning through the canopy into throughfall and stemflow. Most studies focus on the isotopic composition of throughfall, whereas that of stemflow has been studied much less frequently. Moreover, only three studies to date have investigated stemflow isotopic composition at the intra-storm scale. Therefore, knowledge of the isotopic shift between rainfall and throughfall/stemflow at fine resolutions is sorely needed in order to better understand water input to forest soils. In this study, intra-event rainfall, throughfall and stemflow in a Scots pine forest under Mediterranean conditions were monitored (5-min time step) over a 20-month period (May 2018 to December 2019) and water samples of each component were collected sequentially by means of automatic samplers for isotopic analysis (O-1(8) and H-2). Results obtained for 21 rainfall events show that throughfall was usually more enriched than rainfall and stemflow was more enriched than throughfall. Isotopic differences between rainfall and throughfall/stemflow indicated that throughfall was more depleted during the higher air temperature season whereas stemflow was more enriched. The isotopic shift did not show any direct relationship with either meteorological variables or the amount effect. At the intra-storm scale, stemflow was more enriched than rainfall and throughfall at the start of the rainfall event and tended to decrease towards the end. Our results suggest that evaporation led to stemflow enrichment due to stemflow residing longer on the vegetative surfaces than throughfall. However, most fractionation factors can occur during the same event. Our study will improve understanding of the physical processes that control stemflow isotopic composition in coniferous trees before reaching the ground, as a step towards improving isotope-based models for forest-water interactions.

Snow depth and density were measured along transects stratified by land cover over the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 winters. Daily snow depth was measured using a time-lapse (TL) camera at each transect. Semivariogram analysis of the transect data was conducted, and no autocorrelation was found, indicating little spatial structure along the transects. Pairwise differences in snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) between land covers were calculated and compared across scales. Differences in snowpack between forested sites at the TL points corresponded to differences in canopy cover, but this relationship was not evident at the transect scale, indicating a difference in observed process across scale. TL and transect estimates had substantial bias, but consistency in error was observed, which indicates that scaling coefficients may be derived to improve point scale estimates. TL and transect measurements were upscaled to estimate grid scale means. Upscaled estimates were compared and found to be consistent, indicating that appropriately stratified point scale measurements can be used to approximate a grid scale mean when transect data are not available. These findings are important in remote regions such as the study area, where frequent transect data may be difficult to obtain. TL, transect, and upscaled means were compared with modelled depth and SWE. Model comparisons with TL and transect data indicated that bias was dependent on land cover, measurement scale, and seasonality. Modelled means compared well with upscaled estimates, but model SWE was underestimated during spring melt. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the spatial representativeness of in situ measurements and the processes those measurements represent when validating gridded snow products or assimilating data into models.

AB Tracer-derived mean transit times (MTT) and rainfallrunoff modelling were used to explore stream flow generation in 14 Scottish catchments. Both approaches conceptualise the partitioning, storage, and release of water at the catchment scale. The study catchments were predominantly upland and ranged from 0.5 to 1800?km2. Lumped convolution integral models using tracer inputoutput relationships generally provided well-constrained MTT estimates using a gamma function as the transit time distribution. These ranged from 60?days to >10?years and are mainly controlled by catchment soil cover and drainage density. The HBV model was calibrated using upper and lower storage layers to conceptualise rapidly responding near-surface flow paths and slower groundwater contributions to runoff. Calibrated parameters that regulate groundwater recharge and partitioning between the two storages were reasonably well-identified and correlations with MTTs. The most clearly identified parameters and those with the strongest correlations with MTT and landscape controls (particularly soil cover) were the recession coefficients which control the release of water from the upper and lower storage layers. There was also strong correlation between the dynamic storage estimated by HBV and the total catchment storage inferred by tracer damping, although the latter was usually two orders of magnitude greater. This is explained by the different storages estimated: while the total storage inferred by tracers also includes the passive storage involved in mixing, the model estimates dynamic storage from water balance considerations. The former can be interpreted as relating to total porosity, whereas the latter rather corresponds to the drainable porosity. As MTTs for Scottish the uplands can be estimated from catchment characteristics, landscape analysis can be used to constrain sensitive model parameters when modelling in ungauged basins. Furthermore, the dynamic storage inferred by HBV may also be used to provide a first approximation of minimum total catchment storage. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A water budget was established for the open, undisturbed bog Stormossen, central Sweden, for the growing seasons of 1996 and 1997 as a part of the NOPEX project. The water budget was complemented with data on the spatial variation of groundwater levels and water contents in different microrelief elements (ridge, hollow and ridge margin). The seasonal (24 May to 4 October) rainfall, evaporation and runoff were 200, 256, and 43 turn in 1996, respectively, and 310, 286 and 74 mm in 1997, giving negative budgets of -99 mm in 1996 and -50 mm in 1997. Approximately 60% of the total budget was caused by storage changes in the upper 40 cm of the bog and 40% by swelling/shrinking in the layers below. This 'mire breathing' must be incorporated in future models of mire-water dynamics. The water content varied diversely among the different microrelief elements, much depending on the properties of moss and peat together with distance to water table. There also was a strong hysteresis in the relationships between groundwater level and measured volumetric water content, depending partly on pore-throat effects and partly on swelling/shrinking of the peat matrix. A seasonal variation of volumetric water content in a layer beneath water table was found to be larger than what could be justified by compression alone. We think that probable causes could be methane gas expansion together with temperature effects. The main conclusions of this study were: (i) water-transport and storage characteristics are distinctly different among hummocks, ridges and hollows, (ii) mire wetness cannot be deduced from groundwater levels only, and (iii) an important part of the total water storage was caused by swelling/shrinking of the peat, not by changes in unsaturated water content.

AB Artificially enhancing recharge rate into groundwater aquifer at specially designed facilities is an attractive option for increasing the storage capacity of potable water in arid and semi-arid region such as Damascus basin (Syria). Two dug wells (I and II) for water injection and 24 wells for water extraction are available in Mazraha station for artificial recharge experiment. Chemical and stable isotopes (d2H and d18O) were used to evaluate artificial recharge efficiency. 400 to 500*103?m3 of spring water were injected annually into the ambient shallow groundwater in Mazraha station, which is used later for drinking purpose. Ambient groundwater and injected spring water are calcium bicarbonate type with EC about 880 +/- 60 mu S/cm and 300 +/- 50 mu S/cm, respectively. The injected water is under saturated versus calcite and the ambient groundwater is over saturated, while the recovered water is near equilibrium. It was observed that the injection process formed a chemical dilution plume that improves the groundwater quality. Results demonstrate that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is estimated around 6.8*10-4?m/s. The effective diameter of artificial recharge is limited to about 250?m from the injection wells. Mixing rate of 30% is required in order to reduce nitrate concentration below 50?mg/l which is considered the maximum concentration limit for potable water. Deuterium and oxygen-18 relationship demonstrates that mixing line between injected water and ambient groundwater has a slope of 6.1. Oxygen-18 and Cl- plot indicates that groundwater salinity origin is from mixing process, and no dissolution and evaporation were observed. These results demonstrate the efficiency of the artificial recharge experiments to restore groundwater storage capacity and to improve the water quality. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Recent studies have suggested that soil water repellency can be one of the important factors affecting hydrological processes on headwater catchments. In Japan, water repellency is known to occur under Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa) forests, a typical plantation type in Japan, however, previous studies have not evaluated the severity of water repellency and its effects on surface runoff generation. To quantify water repellency and its effects, this study combined the critical surface tension (CST) test with a new spraying experiment in which the infiltration rates of water and ethanol solutions sprayed over 0.09-m(2) plots were compared. Long-term intensive hydrological observations of surface runoff from 2-m(2) plots, soil water potential, and soil water content were conducted concurrently.
   The spraying experiment revealed that strong water repellency in surface soils, as quantified by the CST test, caused Hortonian overland flow despite the high conductivity measured under saturated hydrophilic conditions. Generally, the surface runoff coefficient for a storm event was negatively correlated with initial soil moisture conditions. However, during a period of successive storm events separated by short intervals, the coefficient decreased gradually even when the initial moisture conditions were similar. indicating a weakening of water repellency by repeated wetting. On the other hand, a drying period r with long inter-rainfall intervals and increasing air temperature was associated with increases in the surface runoff coefficient. These results suggest that the water repellency and the resultant surface runoff depended on the history of rainfall at the site. Relationships between soil water potential and soil water content indicate that changes in the soil water repellency and consequently surface runoff coefficient could occur during a single storm event.

AB The In-Well Point Velocity Probe (IWPVP) was originally developed for use in screened porous media wells. The tool can characterize small-scale aquifer heterogeneity from wells that have been carefully developed to ensure an open screen and good hydraulic connection with the surrounding aquifer. This capability led to the hypothesis that the IWPVP could be adapted to characterize flow in fractured media, which features small-scale openings (i.e. fractures) that resemble screen slots. To test this hypothesis, a lab-scale fracture flow apparatus (FFA) was fabricated. The FFA consisted of two parallel acrylic plates that could be separated by a fixed distance, simulating a fracture with a known aperture. Two lengths of PVC well casing served as a cylindrical access port and were centrally placed in the plates. This mock-well left the interface with the fracture open - analogous to a fracture intersecting an uncased borehole. The probe was calibrated experimentally by relating known fluxes through the FFA with those measured inside the IWPVP. The ratio of these fluxes was found to be predictable for two aperture sizes (500 mu m and 1290 mu m), based on a flux balance and the Cubic Law. Additionally, the ability of the probe to discern flow direction in a fracture was tested and found to be accurate within +/- 20 degrees under the conditions of the laboratory testing. The results suggest that an IWPVP could be reliably used in fractured media to directly measure horizontal flux and flow direction in a single fracture without reference to Darcy's Law.

AB This paper analyses the relationship between the Saturated Area Ratio (SAR) and the Relative Water Content (RWC) within a hydrological catchment. The SAR-RWC relationship is fundamental in lumped modelling in correctly representing the dominant physical processes. According to the simulations provided by a distributed model (TOPKAPI) on several catchments, the SAR-RWC relationship is affected by hysteresis, which is also supported by observations and numerical simulations by other researchers. Due to the strong linearity, this relationship is difficult to derive analytically. In this paper we propose a physical interpretation of the hysteresis and present a methodology to model it. By incorporating this mechanism in a lumped model, we demonstrate improvement in discharge reproduction as evaluated by comparative streamflow simulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Canadian research on contemporary erosion and sedimentation processes covers a wide range of scales, processes, approaches and environmental problems. This review of recent research focuses on the themes of sediment yield, land-use impact, fine-sediment transport, bed material transport and river morphology and numerical modelling of fluvial landscape development.
   Research on sediment yield and denudation has confirmed that Canadian rivers are often dominated by riparian sediment sources. Studies of the effects of forestry on erosion, in-stream sedimentation and habitat are prominent, including major field experimental studies in coastal and central British Columbia. Studies of fine-sediment transport mechanisms have focused on the composition of particles and the dynamics of flocculation. In fluvial dynamics there have been important contributions to problems of turbulence-scale flow structure and entrainment processes, and the characteristics of bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers. Although much of the work has been empirical and field-based, results of numerical modelling of denudational processes and landscape development also have begun to appear.
   The nature of research in Canada is driven by the progress of the science internationally, but also by the nature of the Canadian landscape, its history and resource exploitation. Yet knowledge of Canadian rivers is still limited, and problems of, for example, large pristine rivers or rivers in cold climates, remain unexplored. Research on larger scale issues of sediment transfer or the effects of hydrological change is now hampered by reductions in national monitoring programmes. This also will make it difficult to test theory and assess modelling results. Monitoring has been replaced by project- and issues-based research, which has yielded some valuable information on river system processes and opened opportunities for fluvial scientists. However, future contributions will depend on our ability to continue with fundamental fluvial science while fulfilling the management agenda. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB To compare the impacts of river discharge on the surface water quality of the Xiangjiang River in China, 12 surface water quality parameters recorded at 31 sampling sites from January 1998 to December 2008 along the river and its main tributaries were analyzed. Significantly higher concentrations of total nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, and total phosphorus, and biochemical oxygen demand were observed during low-flow periods than during high-flow periods, implying a higher risk to local residents drinking untreated water during low-flow periods. Pollution indexes, including the inorganic pollution index and integrated pollution index (IPI), were negatively related to impervious surface area (ISA) and cropland area (CLA) when ISA (CLA) was less than 160 (3000) km2. However, the relationship was positive when ISA (CLA) was larger than 160 (3000) km2, which provided a reasonable explanation for the observed spatial patterns of water quality. Distinct increasing temporal trends for two kinds of pollution indexes were also found. The annual ISA was significantly related to the rapid degradation of water quality from 1998 to 2008, with correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.816 (p=0.002) and 0.711 (p=0.014) for the organic pollution index (OPI) and IPI, respectively. However, annual rainfall was negatively correlated with the two indexes with r values of 0.785 (p=0.002) and 0.448 (p=0.093) for OPI and IPI, respectively. Our study highlights that decision makers should be more aware of recent increases in the pollution of the Xiangjiang River, especially at downriver sites and during low-flow periods.

AB To detect the causal relationship between cave drip waters and stalagmite laminae, which have been Used as a climate chan-c proxy, three drip sites in Beijing Shihua Cave were monitored for discharge and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Drip discharges and DOC were determined at 0 to 14-day intervals over the period 2004-2006. Drip discharges show two types of response to surface precipitation variations: (1) a rapid response; and (2) a time-lagged response. Intra-annual variability in drip discharge is significantly higher than inter-annual variability. The content of DOC in all drip waters varies inter- and intra-annually and has good correlation with drip water discharge at the rapid response sites. High DOC was observed in July and August in the three years observed. The flusing of soil organic matter is dependent upon the intensity of rain events. The DOC content of drip water increases sharply above a threshold rainfall intensity (>50 mm d(-1)) and shows several pulses correspondim, with intense rain events (>25 mm d(-1)). The DOC content was lower and less variable during the dry Period than during the rainy period. The shape of DOC peak also varies front year to year as it is influenced by the intensity and frequency of rainfall. The different drip sites show marked differences in DOC response, which are dominated by hydrological behaviour linked to the recharge of the soil and karst micro-fissure/porosity network. The results explain why not all stalagmite laminae are consistent with climate changes and suggest that the structure of the rainy season events could be preserved in speleothems.

AB The purposes of this study are to identify the bias of applying the analysis of a log-log plot of baseflow and to derive an equation to describe successive regional mean baseflow. The function -dQ/dt = a Q(b) has been used to describe baseflow in many studies that obtain the values of a and b from the log-log plot. According to analysis in this study, the value of I can be assigned to b in two boundary conditions, but the parameter a is proved to be related to the depth of water table and starting time of recession and thus different values of a may be found for different recession events. This paper points out that no single regression line can be obtained by plotting all baseflow data on a log-log diagram. Instead, there should be parallel lines, and each for a recession event. It implies that no single set of parameters a and b can be applied to predict baseflow. Thus, a new equation describing the relationship between three successive mean baseflows was derived in this study. The bias in the analysis of the log-log plot and the ability of the derived equation to predict baseflow were verified for five watersheds in Taiwan. Results indicate that the formula of mean baseflow prediction can provide reasonable estimates of flows with a leading time of 6 days. Furthermore, stream flows of the Tonkawa creek watershed in USA were used to verify that using average flows can result in better predictions than using instantaneous flows.

AB A multiple fractal model that considers the fractal properties of both porous matrices and fracture networks is proposed for the permeability of dual-porosity media embedded with randomly distributed fractures. In this model, the aperture distribution is verified to follow the fractal scaling law, and the porous matrix is assumed to comprise a bundle of tortuous capillaries that also follow the fractal scaling law. Analytical expressions for fractal aperture distribution, total flow rate, total equivalent permeability, and dimensionless permeability are established, where the dimensionless permeability is defined as the ratio of permeability of the porous matrices to that of the fracture networks. The dimensionless permeability is closely correlated to the structural parameters (i.e., alpha, theta, D-tf, D-tp, D-e, D-p, e(max), lambda(max)) of the dual-porosity media, and it is more sensitive to the fractal dimension for the size distribution of fracture aperture than to that for the size distribution of pore/capillary diameter. The maximum pore/capillary diameter has a greater impact on the dimensionless permeability than that of the maximum fracture aperture. The dimensionless permeability of fracture networks constructed by the fractal aperture distribution has close values with those of models with lognormal aperture distribution. The proposed multiple fractal model does not involve any empirical constants that do not have clear physical meanings, which could serve as a quick estimation method for assessing permeability of dual-porosity media.

AB Peatlands in the Western Boreal Plains act as important water sources in the landscape. Their persistence, despite potential evapotranspiration (PET) often exceeding annual precipitation, is attributed to various water storage mechanisms. One storage element that has been understudied is seasonal ground ice (SGI). This study characterized spring SGI conditions and explored its impacts on available energy, actual evapotranspiration, water table, and near surface soil moisture in a western boreal plains peatland. The majority of SGI melt took place over May 2017. Microtopography had limited impact on melt rates due to wet conditions. SGI melt released 139mm in ice water equivalent (IWE) within the top 30cm of the peat, and weak significant relationships with water table and surface moisture suggest that SGI could be important for maintaining vegetation transpiration during dry springs. Melting SGI decreased available energy causing small reductions in PET (<10mm over the melt period) and appeared to reduce actual evapotranspiration variability but not mean rates, likely due to slow melt rates. This suggests that melting SGI supplies water, allowing evapotranspiration to occur at near potential rates, but reduces the overall rate at which evapotranspiration could occur (PET). The role of SGI may help peatlands in headwater catchments act as a conveyor of water to downstream landscapes during the spring while acting as a supply of water for the peatland. Future work should investigate SGI influences on evapotranspiration under differing peatland types, wet and dry spring conditions, and if the spatial variability of SGI melt leads to spatial variability in evapotranspiration.

AB By utilizing functional relationships based on observations at plot or field scales, water quality models first compute surface runoff and then use it as the primary governing variable to estimate sediment and nutrient transport. When these models are applied at watershed scales, this serial model structure, coupling a surface runoff sub-model with a water quality sub-model, may be inappropriate because dominant hydrological processes differ among scales. A parallel modeling approach is proposed to evaluate how best to combine dominant hydrological processes for predicting water quality at watershed scales. In the parallel scheme, dominant variables of water quality models are identified based entirely on their statistical significance using time series analysis. Four surface runoff models of different model complexity were assessed using both the serial and parallel approaches to quantify the uncertainty on forcing variables used to predict water quality. The eight alternative model structures were tested against a 25-year high-resolution data set of streamflow, suspended sediment discharge, and phosphorous discharge at weekly time steps. Models using the parallel approach consistently performed better than serial-based models, by having less error in predictions of watershed scale streamflow, sediment and phosphorus, which suggests model structures of water quantity and quality models at watershed scales should be reformulated by incorporating the dominant variables. The implication is that hydrological models should be constructed in a way that avoids stacking one sub-model with one set of scale assumptions onto the front end of another sub-model with a different set of scale assumptions.

AB Information on the main drivers of subsurface flow generation on hillslopes of alpine headwater catchments is still missing. Therefore, the dominant factors controlling the water table response to precipitation at the hillslope scale in the alpine Bridge Creek Catchment, Northern Italy, were investigated. Two steep hillslopes of similar size, soil properties and vegetation cover but contrasting topography were instrumented with 24 piezometric wells. Sixty-three (63) rainfall-runoff events were selected over three years in the snow-free months to analyse the influence of rainfall depth, antecedent moisture conditions, hillslope topographic characteristics and soil depth on shallow water table dynamics. Piezometric response, expressed as percentage of well activation and water peak magnitude, was strongly correlated with soil moisture status, as described by an index combining antecedent soil moisture and rainfall depth. Hillslope topography was found to be a dominant control only for the convex-divergent hillslope and during wet conditions. Timing of water table response depended primarily on soil depth and topographic position, with piezometric peak response occurring later and showing a greater temporal variability at the hillslope bottom, characterized by thicker soil. The relationship between mean hillslope water table level and standard deviation for all wells reflected the timing of the water table response at the different locations along the hillslopes. The outcomes of this research contribute to a better understanding of the controls on piezometric response at the hillslope scale in steep terrain and its role on the hydrological functioning of the study catchment and of other sites with similar physiographic characteristics.

AB Understanding the variables regulating tile-flow response to precipitation in the US Midwest is critical for water quality management. This study (1) investigates the relationship between precipitation characteristics, antecedent water table depth and tile-flow response at a high temporal resolution during storms; and (2) determines the relative importance of macropore flow versus matrix flow in tile flow in a tile-drained soya bean field in Indiana. In spring, although variations in antecedent water table depth imparted some variation in tile-flow response to precipitation, bulk precipitation was the best predictor of mean tile flow, maximum tile flow, time to peak, and run-off ratio. The contribution of macropore flow to total flow significantly increased with precipitation amount, and macropore flow represented between 11 and 50% of total drain flow, with peak contributions between 15 and 74% of flow. For large storms (> 6 cm bulk precipitation), cations data indicated a dilution of groundwater with new water as discharge peaked. Although no clear dilution or concentration patterns for Mg2+ or K+ were observed for smaller tile flow generating events (< 3 cm bulk precipitation), macropore flow still contributed between 11 and 17% of the total flow for these moderate size storms. Inter-drain comparison stressed the need to use triplicate or duplicate tile drain experiments when investigating tile drainage impact on water and N losses at the plot scale. These results significantly increase our understanding of the hydrological functioning of tile-drained fields in spring, when most N losses to streams occur in the US Midwest.

AB Estimation of hydraulic parameters is essential to understand the interaction between groundwater flow and seawater intrusion. Though several studies have addressed hydraulic parameter estimation, based on pumping tests as well as geophysical methods, not many studies have addressed the problem with clayey formations being present. In this study, a methodology is proposed to estimate anisotropic hydraulic conductivity and porosity values for the coastal aquifer with unconsolidated formations. For this purpose, the one-dimensional resistivity of the aquifer and the groundwater conductivity data are used to estimate porosity at discrete points. The hydraulic conductivity values are estimated by its mutual dependence with porosity and petrophysical parameters. From these estimated values, the bilinear relationship between hydraulic conductivity and aquifer resistivity is established based on the clay content of the sampled formation. The methodology is applied on a coastal aquifer along with the coastal Karnataka, India, which has significant clayey formations embedded in unconsolidated rock. The estimation of hydraulic conductivity values from the established correlations has a correlation coefficient of 0.83 with pumping test data, indicating good reliability of the methodology. The established correlations also enable the estimation of horizontal hydraulic conductivity on two-dimensional resistivity sections, which was not addressed by earlier studies. The inventive approach of using the established bilinear correlations at one-dimensional to two-dimensional resistivity sections is verified by the comparison method. The horizontal hydraulic conductivity agrees with previous findings from inverse modelling. Additionally, this study provides critical insights into the estimation of vertical hydraulic conductivity and an equation is formulated which relates vertical hydraulic conductivity with horizontal. Based on the approach presented, the anisotropic hydraulic conductivity of any type aquifer with embedded clayey formations can be estimated. The anisotropic hydraulic conductivity has the potential to be used as an important input to the groundwater models.

AB Human-induced afforestation has been one of the main policies for environmental management of farmland abandonment in Mediterranean areas. Over the last decades, several studies have reviewed the impact of afforestation activities on geomorphological and hydrological responses and soil properties, although few studies have evaluated the effects on water table dynamics. In parallel to human-induced afforestation activities, natural revegetation occurred in abandoned fields and in fields where the intensity of human activity declined, driving the expansion of shrubs. This research addresses the spatial and temporal variability of water table dynamics in a small afforested sub-catchment located in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. Differences between afforestation (Pinus nigra and Pinus sylvestris) and natural plant colonization (shrubs, mainly Genista scorpius, Buxus sempervirens, and Juniperus communis) and early abandoned meadows (G. scorpius), are analysed in terms of runoff generation and seasonal water table depth dynamics. Precipitation, runoff and water table datasets recorded for the 2014-2019 period are used. Results show a high temporal and spatial variability with large fluctuations in discharge and water table. Groundwater dynamics varied markedly over the year, identifying a wet and dry period with different responses suggesting different runoff generation processes (Hortonian flow during dry and wet periods, and saturation excess runoff during wet conditions). Furthermore, important differences are noted among the various land cover types: (i) in the natural revegetation area (shrubland and meadows) a marked seasonal cycle was observed with short saturation periods during winter and spring; and (ii) in the afforestation areas, the water table dynamics showed a seasonal cycle with a high variability, with fast responses and rapid oscillations. Likewise, the relationship between the depth of water table and hydrological variables was not straightforward, suggesting complex hydrological behaviour.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET), a key component of the hydrological cycle, affects the transport of water and energy in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. Thus, quantifying the driving forces of ET dynamics is important to ensure rational water resource utilization. Based on meteorological and satellite data, spatiotemporal dynamics of ET were detected using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model, and effects of climate variability and landscape pattern change on ET dynamics in an arid to semiarid landscape mosaic during the growing season (April-October) from 2001 to 2015 in Xilingol League, China were evaluated. The results indicated that (a) a significant increase (P < .05) in ET was found in the north-eastern Xilingol League, and a significant decrease (P < .05) in ET was confined to the southwest and (b) climate variability had significant effects on ET dynamics. All climatic factors showed a positive correlation relationship with ET dynamics, and mean temperature (Ta) was the most influential climatic factor on ET dynamics followed by relative humidity (Rh), wind speed (Ws), and precipitation (Pr), respectively. The influence of landscape pattern change on ET dynamics was mainly reflected in the increase of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) promoting ET dynamics. Several other landscape pattern metrics also had important impacts on ET dynamics, which were mainly reflected in the positive effect of the aggregation index (AI) on ET dynamics and the negative effects of the largest patch index (LPI), edge density (ED), and percentage of landscape (PLAND) on ET dynamics. To promote effective water resource utilization, landscape managers should continue to moderately implement vegetation restoration projects such as the Grain for Green Project, orient with conversion of low-quality cropland into grassland, and conserve large areas of grassland. Appropriate management measures for forests and cropland scattered in the landscape mosaic, based on local climate and soil properties, as well as socioeconomic goals, are also required.

AB For small tropical islands with limited freshwater resources, understanding how island hydrology is influenced by regional climate is important, considering projected hydroclimate and sea level changes as well as growing populations dependent on limited groundwater resources. However, the relationship between climate variability and hydrologic variability for many tropical islands remains uncertain due to local hydroclimatic data scarcity. Here, we present a case study from Kiritimati, Republic of Kiribati (2 degrees N, 157 degrees W), utilizing the normalized difference vegetation index to investigate variability in island surface water area, an important link between climate variability and groundwater storage. Kiritimati surface water area varies seasonally, following wet and dry seasons, and interannually, due to hydroclimate variability associated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. The NINO3.4 sea surface temperature index, satellite-derived precipitation, precipitation minus evaporation, and local sea level all had significant positive correlations with surface water area. Lagged correlations show sea level changes and precipitation influence surface water area up to 6 months later. Differences in the timing of surface water area changes and variable climate-surface water area correlations in island subregions indicate that surface hydrology on Kiritimati is not uniform in response to climate variations. Rather, the magnitude of the ocean-atmosphere anomalies and island-ocean connectivity determine the extent to which sea level and precipitation control surface water area. The very strong 2015-2016 El Nino event led to the largest surface water area measured in the 18-year data set. Surface water area decreased to pre-event values in a similarly rapid manner (<6 months) after both the very strong 2015-2016 event and the 2009-2010 moderate El Nino event. Future changes in the frequency and amplitude of interannual hydroclimate variability as well as seasonal duration will thus alter surface water coverage on Kiritimati, with implications for freshwater resources, flooding, and drought.

AB Single or a limited number of point observations, such as from index stations, are commonly assumed to be representative for the snow cover of larger areas in many applications. This study presents a systematic investigation of the relationship between point observations and areal mean snow depths ranging from the scale of tens of metres to entire catchments. We analyse aerial snow depth information from four mountain regions in the European Alps, one in the Spanish Pyrenees and one in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, obtained from airborne laser scanning surveys. This rich data set allowed to compare point values with snow cover statistics, reflecting the real snow depth distribution of the investigation areas. We present two contrasting approaches in order to assess the representativeness of typical flat-field snow depth measurements. In the first approach, we define potential index stations based on topographic characteristics as commonly applied for snow cover monitoring stations. The point observations of these index stations are then compared with the mean values in their vicinities. We show that most of the index stations strongly overestimate the snow depth of the catchment and of their surrounding area at distances of several hundreds of metres. Results confirm the expectation that the larger the support area, the smaller the difference to the mean of the complete catchment. The second approach was to analyse topographic characteristics of all cells with snow depths that deviated less than 10% from the catchment mean. It appears that these representative cells are rather randomly distributed and cannot be identified a priori. In summary, our results show large potential biases of index stations with respect to snow distribution and therefore also snow water equivalent. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The conditions under which the Saint Venant equations system for unsteady open channel flow, as an initial-boundary value problem, becomes self-similar are investigated by utilizing one-parameter Lie group of point scaling transformations. One of the advantages of this methodology is that the self-similarity conditions due to the initial and boundary conditions can also be investigated thoroughly in addition to the conditions due to the governing equation. The obtained self-similarity conditions are compared with the scaling relationships that are derived through the Froude similitude. It is shown that the initial-boundary value problem of a one-dimensional unsteady open channel flow process in a prototype domain can be self-similar with that of several different scaled domains. However, the values of all the flow variables (at specified time and space) under different scaled domains can be upscaled to the same values in the prototype domain (at the corresponding time and space), as shown in this study. Distortion in scales of different space dimensions has been implemented extensively in physical hydraulic modelling, mainly because of cost, space and time limitations. Unlike the traditional approach, the distinction is made between the longitudinal-horizontal and transverse-horizontal length scales in this study. The scaled domain obtained by the proposed approach, when scaling ratios of channel width and water depth are equal, is particularly important for the similarity of flow characteristics in a cross-section because the width-to-depth ratio and the inclination angles of the banks are conserved in a cross-section. It is also shown that the scaling ratio of the roughness coefficient under distorted channel conditions depends on that of hydraulic radius and longitudinal length. The proposed scaling relations obtained by the Lie group scaling approach may provide additional spatial, temporal and economical flexibility in setting up physical hydraulic models.

AB The potential influence of pH on water repellency in soils has already been mentioned in some studies, but no clear correlation between these parameters has been found to date. In addition, although correlations of water content and water repellency have been found in numerous studies, the influence of drying and subsequent storage conditions on water repellency are still unclear. In this study, a series of samples showing water repellent and wettable conditions respectively at field moist states from two urban locations were compared regarding two main aspects: (i) the influence of artificial pH-changes on their wetting behaviour and (ii) sample wettability changes during drying for different drying temperatures. The assumption made in a study by Hurrass and Schaumann (2006) on the same sample site, that differences in wettability of closely neighboured samples from one sample location can be interrelated with differences in pH, was confirmed. However, in contrast to the assumption that rising pH will improve the wettability and decreasing pH will intensify water repellency, we found a maximum in water repellency at a pH above the initial pH. The results from drying samples at different temperatures confirmed the dependence of water repellency development on the drying temperature. Additionally, we could confirm the conclusion from previous studies that the water content alone cannot explain the water content-WDPT (water drop penetration time) relationship. The results from drying and pH changes show that some location specific factors, like the number of pH active functional groups, may be relevant for sample wettability. As additional mechanism, which may be partly antagonistic to the influence of the water content, we assume temperature-dependent conformational changes in SOM (Soil Organic Matter). It seems that aspects of these conformational changes may additionally be governed by pH in one of our two locations. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study proposes a general method of parameterizing the big-leaf model that is applicable to estimation of daytime dry-canopy evaporation (hereafter, evaporation) rates of coniferous forest stands without observed flux data. The method considers variation in the reference value of surface conductance G(s) between individual stands by incorporating a relationship between canopy height and reference G(s) values reported by Komatsu (2003c) [Hydrological Processes 17: 2503-2512]. However, the method does not consider variation in modifier functions of G(s) and in aerodynamic conductance G(a) between individual stands.
   We examined the validity of the method based on daytime evaporation rate data for 26 coniferous stands. The method showed greater predictability than another method that ignores variation in reference G(s) values between individual stands. This illustrates the validity of considering variation in reference G(s) values between individual stands. Model predictability was not enhanced by considering variation in modifier functions of G(s) and G(a) between individual stands. This illustrates the validity of ignoring variation in modifier functions of G(s) and G(a) between individual stands. The method is applicable to stands with projected LAI greater than or equal to 3(.)0 and canopy height < c. 30 m.
   The method can result in errors when applied outside these limitations. Regardless, the method should be valuable for estimating daytime evaporation rates of coniferous stands, as many stands fall within these limitations. The method is applicable to evaporation rate estimates in growing seasons without soil water stress when dry-canopy evaporation significantly affects the forest water cycle. At this stage, the method can result in errors when applied outside this limitation. However. the method should be valuable as a basis for developing a more comprehensive method applicable outside this limitation. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Large areas of Europe, especially in the Alps, are covered by carbonate rocks, and karst springs are an important source for drinking water supply. Because of their high variability and heterogeneity, understanding the hydrogeological functioning is of particular importance for protection of karst aquifers. In this study, hydrogeochemical investigations characterized the water of a spring draining a complex carbonategypsum karst system in the Alps. The reaction of the spring to a rainfall event was examined to identify the relevant hydrological processes controlling the hydrochemistry of the spring, and to understand water-rock interactions and conduit-matrix exchange. A fast and marked reaction of discharge and electrical conductivity was observed. The main cations are Ca2+ and Mg2+, which showed a distinct decrease after the rainfall. Bicarbonate and sulfate were identified as major anions. Although HCO3- showed only minor fluctuations, SO42- decreased by 72% after the rain event. Comparisons of ion ratios show that both carbonate and gypsum rocks influence the water chemistry of the spring. The rainfall event caused a dilution effect, but dilution alone cannot explain the observed water chemistry. A conceptual model of the spring behaviour during low-flow and high-flow conditions, including conduitmatrix interaction, was developed, which can explain the observations. This study aims to give new insights into the highly dynamic exchange processes between karst conduits and the surrounding matrix, and the results demonstrated that (a) during low-flow conditions, the spring is characterized by high sulfate content, but after rainfall events, the water chemistry is dominated by bicarbonate. These findings show the dependency of water chemistry from the lithology; (b) a change in water chemistry is associated with a significant shift from low-flow to high-flow conditions; (c) conduitmatrix exchange is an important factor as shown by the discharge-sulfate relationship and clearly influences the behaviour of the spring.

AB Tributaries may either ameliorate or exacerbate the geomorphic and ecologic impacts of flow regulation by altering the flux Of water and sediment into the flow-regulated mainstem. To capture the effects of tributary influences on a flow regulated river. long-term discharge and cross-sectional data are used to assess the geomorphic and hydrologic impacts of impoundment. In addition. the use of the short-lived cosmogenic radioisotope Be-7 (half-life 53.4 days) to link sediment transport dynamics to benthic macroinvertebrate community structure is evaluated. It is found that the 7 Be activity of transitional bed load sediment is highly seasonal and reflects both variations in activity of sediment sources and limited sediment residence time within the junction. Benthic communities also exhibit it strong seasonal variability. In the spring, neither the 7 Be activity of the sediment, nor benthic communities exhibit clear relationships with sample site location. In contrast, during the late summer the ratio of Ephemeroptera (mayflies)/Trichoptera (caddisflies) decreased significantly below tributary junctions. This decrease in benthic community ratio was driven by increases in caddisfly abundance and was strongly correlated with the presence of recently 7 Be tagged transitional bedload sediment. These observations are probably associated with the presence of coarse, stable, and unembedded Substrate downstream of triburaries and the rapid turnover of sediment that may also be associated with a rapid flux in nutrients or seston. The results show that tributaries are impacting the flow-regulated mainstem and that these impacts are reflected in the benthic community structure and in the Be-7 activity of transitional bed load sediment. Moreover. the observed reduction ill Competence and capacity of the mainstem following flood control suggests that these spatial discontinuities may be a consequence Of impoundment.

AB Wetlands are known for their water filtration (or purification) function. Although different wetland types differ in their filtration capacity, they are usually aggregated together in economic valuation studies. Here, we explicitly separate the valuation of the suspended sediment and phosphorus (P) filtration services of the four major wetland types-bogs, fens, marshes and swamps-found in southern Ontario, Canada. The areal extents of the four wetland types are derived from the Canadian Wetland Inventory (CWI) progress map, while the sediment accretion rate is used as the key variable regulating the suspended sediment and P filtration functions. Based on available literature data, we assess the relationship of the sediment accretion rate to wetland size. Because only weak positive correlations are found, we assign a mean (average) sediment accretion rate to each wetland type. The sediment accretion rates are combined with mean soil P concentrations to estimate Pretention rates by the wetlands. The replacement cost method is then applied to valuate the sediment and P filtration services. The unit values for both sediment and P retention decrease in the order: marshes > bogs approximate to swamps > fens. The total value of sediment plus phosphorus removal by all wetlands in southern Ontario amounts to $4.2 +/- 2.9 billion per year, of which about 80% is accounted for by swamps. We further assess the costs of different options to offset the additional P loading generated in a hypothetical scenario whereby all wetlands are converted to agriculture. The results demonstrate that replacing the P filtration function of existing wetlands with conventional land management and water treatment solutions is not cost-effective, hence reinforcing the importance of protecting existing wetlands.

AB Hydrological threshold behaviour has been observed across hillslopes and catchments with varying characteristics. Few studies, however, have evaluated rainfall-run-off response in areas dominated by agricultural land use and artificial subsurface drainage. Hydrograph analysis was used to identify distinct hydrological events over a 9-year period and examine rainfall characteristics, dynamic water storage, and surface and subsurface run-off generation in a drained and farmed closed depression in north-eastern Indiana, USA. Results showed that both surface flow and subsurface tile flow displayed a threshold relationship with the sum of rainfall amount and soil moisture deficit (SMD). Neither surface flow nor subsurface tile flow was observed unless rainfall amount exceeded the SMD. Timing of subsurface tile flow relative to soil moisture response on the shoulder slope of the depression indicated that the formation and drainage of perched water tables on depression hillslopes were likely the main mechanism that produced subsurface connectivity. Surface flow generation was delayed compared with subsurface tile flow during rainfall events due to differences in soil water storage along depression hillslopes and run-off generation mechanisms. These findings highlight the substantial impact of subsurface tile drainage on the hydrology of closed depressions; the bottom of the depression, the wettest area prior to drainage installation, becomes the driest part of the depression after installation of subsurface drainage. Rapid connectivity of localized subsurface saturation zones during rainfall events is also greatly enhanced because of subsurface drainage. Thus, less fill is required to generate substantial spill. Understanding hydrologic processes in drained and farmed closed depressions is a critical first step in developing improved water and nutrient management strategies in this landscape.

AB Sensitivity analysis of the hydrological behaviour of basins has mainly focused on the correlation between streamflow and climate, ignoring the uncertainty of future climate and not utilizing complex hydrological models. However, groundwater storage is affected by climatic change and human activities. The streamflow of many basins is primarily sourced from the natural discharge of aquifers in upstream regions. The correlation between streamflow and groundwater storage has not been thoroughly discussed. In this study, the storage-discharge sensitivity of 22 basins in Taiwan was investigated by means of daily streamflow and rainfall data obtained over more than 30 years. The relationship between storage and discharge variance was evaluated using low-flow recession analysis and a water balance equation that ignores the influence of rainfall and evapotranspiration. Based on the obtained storage-discharge sensitivity, this study explored whether the water storage and discharge behaviour of the studied basins is susceptible to climate change or human activities and discusses the regional differences in storage-discharge sensitivity. The results showed that the average storage-discharge sensitivities were 0.056 and 0.162 mm(-1) in the northern and southern regions of Taiwan, respectively. In the central and eastern regions, the values were both 0.020 mm(-1). The storage-discharge sensitivity was very high in the southern region. The regional differences in storage-discharge sensitivity with similar climate conditions are primarily due to differences in aquifer properties. Based on the recession curve, other factors responsible for these differences include land utilization, land coverage, and rainfall patterns during dry and wet seasons. These factors lead to differences in groundwater recharge and thus to regional differences in storage-discharge sensitivity.

ID WATER
AB Numerical groundwater flow models necessarily are limited to subsurface flow evaluation. It is of interest, however, to examine the possibility that, for unconfined aquifer systems, they could be used to proportionately measure the magnitude of seepage they estimate when these aquifers intersect the landscape surface. Our goal in this study was to determine the degree to which an unconfined groundwater model can estimate run-off or seepage at the land surface during winter time wet season conditions, as well as in the dry season, when evapotranspiration is a major part of the water balance, using a lowland basin-fill example study area in the Pacific Northwest. The exit gradient is a metric describing the potential for vertical seepage at the landscape surface. We investigated the spatial relationship of mapped surface features, such as wetlands, streams and ponds, to the model-predicted mapped exit gradient. We found that areas mapped as wetlands had positive exit gradients. During the wet season, modelled exit gradients predicted seepage throughout extensive areas of the groundwater shed, extending far beyond mapped wetland areas (355% increase), associated with previously observed increases in nitrate-nitrogen in streams in wet season. During the dry season, exit gradients spatially corresponded with wetland areas. The increase in in-stream nitrogen corresponds with shorter residence times in carbon-rich wetland zones because of the onset of saturation overland flow. We present results that suggest that the exit gradient could be a useful concept in examining the groundwater-surface water linkage that is often under represented physically in watershed flow models.

AB The Soil Conservation Service curve number (CN) method commonly uses three discrete levels of soil antecedent moisture condition (AMC), defined by the 5-day antecedent rainfall depth, to describe soil moisture prior to a runoff event. However, this way may not adequately represent soil water conditions of fields and watersheds in the Loess Plateau of China. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the effective soil moisture depth to which the CN is most related, (2) to evaluate a discrete and a linear relationship between AMC and soil moisture; and (3) to develop an equation between CN and Soil moisture to predict runoff better for the climatic and soil conditions of the Loess Plateau of China. The dataset consisted of 10 years of rainfall, runoff and soil moisture measurements from four experimental plots cropped with millet, pasture and potatoes. Results indicate that the standard CN method underestimated runoff depths for 85 of the 98 observed plot-runoff events, with a model efficiency E of only 0.243. For our experimental conditions, the discrete and linear approaches improved runoff estimation, but still underestimated most runoff events, with E values of 0.428 and 0.445 respectively. Based on the measured CN values and soil moisture values in the top 15 cm of the soil, a non-linear equation was developed that predicted runoff better with an E value of 0.779. This modified CN equation was the most appropriate for runoff prediction in the study area, but may need adjustments for local conditions in the Loess Plateau of China.

AB Rill erosion is a serious concern in the hilly region of China with purple soil, and maize is extensively cultivated in this region. Evaluations of the dynamic mechanisms of rill erosion in sloping farmland areas are particularly important during the maize growing season to determine whether rill erosion can occur. A new ridge tillage (RT) system was designed using local agricultural methods in China. Twelve artificial rainfall experiments were conducted in three 1 x 2 m experimental plots with a slope of 15 degrees, which is a typical slope in the study area. The rainfall intensities were designated as 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm min(-1). The rainfall experiments were performed in the field to determine the characteristics of run-off and sediment transport related to rill erosion processes during different stages of maize growth and to analyse how hydraulic parameters and the sediment yield of the rill erosion process are related. The results showed that rill flow patterns were mainly classified as subcritical transition flow during all the growth stages of maize. The effects of hydrodynamic parameters on the sediment yield were ordered as follows: Reynolds number > stream power > Froude number > shear stress. The total sediment yield varied by stage as follows: seedling stage > jointing stage > mature stage > tasseling stage. The sediment yield and run-off rate exhibited a linear relationship that was well described at the hillslope scale. To initiate soil loss in sloping farmland areas with purple soil during the maize growing season, the critical hydrodynamic shear stress and stream power must be at least 46.505 Pa and 1.541 N m(-1) s(-1), respectively.

AB Quantifying the relative contributions of different sources of water to a stream hydrograph is important for understanding the hydrology and water quality dynamics of a given watershed. To compare the performance of two methods of hydrograph separation, a graphical program [baseflow index (BFI)] and an end-member mixing analysis that used high-resolution specific conductance measurements (SC-EMMA) were used to estimate daily and average long-term slowflow additions of water to four small, primarily agricultural streams with different dominant sources of water (natural groundwater, overland flow, subsurface drain outflow, and groundwater from irrigation). Because the result of hydrograph separation by SC-EMMA is strongly related to the choice of slowflow and fastflow end-member values, a sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the various approaches reported in the literature to inform the selection of end-members. There were substantial discrepancies among the BFI and SC-EMMA, and neither method produced reasonable results for all four streams. Streams that had a small difference in the SC of slowflow compared with fastflow or did not have a monotonic relationship between streamflow and stream SC posed a challenge to the SC-EMMA method. The utility of the graphical BFI program was limited in the stream that had only gradual changes in streamflow. The results of this comparison suggest that the two methods may be quantifying different sources of water. Even though both methods are easy to apply, they should be applied with consideration of the streamflow and/or SC characteristics of a stream, especially where anthropogenic water sources (irrigation and subsurface drainage) are present.

AB As the substantial component of the ecosystem respiration, soil CO2 flux is strongly influenced by infrequent and unpredictable precipitation in arid region. In the current study, we investigated the response of soil CO2 flux to rain pulses at a saline desert in western China. Soil CO2 flux was measured continuously during the whole growing season of 2009 at six sites. We found that there were remarkable changes in amplitude or diurnal patterns of soil CO2 flux induced by rainfall events: from bimodal before rain to a single peak after that. Further analysis indicated that there is a significant linear relationship (P?<?0.001) between soil CO2 flux and soil temperature (Tsoil). However, a hysteresis between the waveform of diurnal course of CO2 flux and Tsoil was observed: with soil CO2 flux always peaked earlier than Tsoil. Furthermore, a double exponential decay function was fitted to the soil CO2 flux after rainfall, and total carbon (C) releases were estimated by numerical integration for rainfall events. The relative enhancement and total C release, in association with the rain pulses, was linearly related to the amount of precipitation. According to the size and frequency of rainfall events, the total amount of C release induced by rain pulses was computed as much as 7.88?g C.m2 in 2009, equivalent to 10.25% of gross primary production. These results indicated that rain pulses played a significant role in the carbon budget of this saline desert ecosystem, and the size of them was a good indicator of rain-induced flux enhancement.

AB Fractals are famous for their self-similar nature at different spatial scales. Similar to fractals, solutions of scale invariant processes are self-similar at different space-time scales. This unique property of scale-invariant processes can be utilized to translate the solution of the processes at a much larger or smaller space-time scale (domain) based on the solution calculated on the original space-time scale. This study investigates scale invariance conditions of kinematic wave overland flow process in one-parameter Lie group of point transformations framework. Scaling (stretching) transformation is one of the one-parameter Lie group of point transformations and it has a unique importance among the other transformations, as it leads to the scale invariance or scale dependence of a process. Scale invariance of a process yields a self-similar solution at different space-time scales. However, the conditions for the process to be scale invariant usually dictate various relationships between the scaling coefficients of the dependent and independent variables of the process. Therefore, the scale invariance of a process does not assure a self-similar solution at any arbitrary space and time scale. The kinematic wave overland flow process is modelled mathematically as initial-boundary value problem. The conditions to be satisfied by the system of governing equations as well as the initial and boundary conditions of the kinematic wave overland flow process are established in order for the process to be scale invariant. Also, self-similarity of the solution of the kinematic wave overland flow under the established invariance conditions is demonstrated by various numerical example problems.

AB The analysis of physicochemical variables and selected dissolved elements was performed on the Apure River waters for 15 months. The variables pH, alkalinity, dissolved O-2, conductivity and Na, Ca, Mg and Cd concentrations showed maximum values during low water, whereas K, Si, Fe, Al, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed maximum concentrations during rising and high water. Five important factors were found to control the amount and temporal variability of the dissolved elements: lithology, hydrology, vegetation-floodplain processes, redox conditions and organic complexation. Weathering of silicates, carbonates and evaporites in the Andes provides most of the proportion of Na, Ca, Mg and HCO3- to waters. The temporal variability of these ions is controlled by a dilution process. Although Si can be taken up by the biomass, Si and K can be leached from the floodplain by weathering of clays. Microbial decay of the submerged plants in the floodplain during the inundation periods provides DOC and K to river waters and changes the redox conditions in water. The changing redox conditions control the solubility of Mn, Zn and Fe. Dissolved Mn is a function of pH-dependent redox process, whereas Zn solubility is controlled by scavenging of Zn during the oxidation of Mn2+ to MnO2. Positive relationships between Al, Fe, Cu, Cr and DOC suggest that these elements are complexed by organic colloids generated in the floodplain. Moreover, the binding capacity of Fe with DOC increases under reducing conditions. Although Cd seems to be provided by weathering in the Andes, several processes can affect the mobility of Cd during transport. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB For sediment yield estimation, intermittent measurements of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) have to be interpolated to derive a Continuous sedigraph. Traditionally, sediment rating Curves (SRCs) based Oil univariate linear regression of discharge and SSC (or the logarithms thereof) are used but alternative approaches (e.g. fuzzy logic. artificial neural networks, etc.) exist. This paper presents a comparison of the applicability of traditional SRCs. generalized linear models (GLMs) and nonparametric regression using Random Forests (RF) and Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) applied to a dataset of SSC obtained for four subcatchments (0.08, 41, 145 and 445 km(2)) in the Central Spanish Pyrenees. The observed SSCs are highly variable and range over six orders of magnitude. For these data, traditional SRCs performed inadequately due to the over-simplification of relating SSC solely to discharge. Instead, the multitude of acting processes required more flexibility to model these nonlinear relationships. Thus, alternative advanced machine learning techniques that have been successfully applied ill other disciplines were tested. GLMs provide the option of including other relevant process variables (e.g. rainfall intensities and temporal information) but require the selection of the most appropriate predictors. For the given datasets, the investigated variable selection methods produced inconsistent results. All proposed GLMs showed an interior performance, whereas RF and QRF proved to be very robust and performed favourably for reproducing sediment dynamics. QRF additionally provides estimates oil the accuracy of the predictions and thus allows the assessment of uncertainties in the estimated sediment yield that is not commonly found in other methods. The capabilities of RF and QRF concerning the interpretation of predictor effects are also Outlined. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID RIGHTS
AB Chile's free-market Water Code turned 20 years old in October 2001. This anniversary was an important milestone for both Chilean and international debates about water policy because Chile has become the world's leading example of the free-market approach to water law and water resources management, the textbook case of treating water rights not merely as private property but also as a fully marketable commodity. The predominant view outside of Chile is that Chilean water markets and the Chilean model of water management have been a success, and this perception has encouraged other countries to follow Chile's lead in water law reform. Much of the debate about Chilean water markets, however, has been based more on theoretical or political beliefs than on empirical study. This paper reverses that emphasis by reviewing the evolution of empirical research about these markets since 1990, when Chile returned to democratic government after 16 years of military rule. During the period since 1990, understanding of how Chilean water markets have worked in practice has gradually improved. There have been two major trends in this research: first, a gradual shift from exaggerated claims of the markets' success toward more balanced assessments of mixed results and, second, a heavy emphasis on the economics of water rights trading with very little attention given to the Water Code's impacts on social equity, river basin management, environmental protection, or resolution of water conflicts. The analysis in this study is qualitative and interdisciplinary, combining law, economics, and institutions.

AB Dynamic relationships among rainfall patterns, soil water distribution, and plant growth are crucial for sustainable conservation of soil and water resources in water-limited ecosystems. Spatial and temporal variation in deep soil water content at a watershed scale have not yet been characterized adequately due to the lack of deep soil water data. Deep soil-water storage (SWS) up to a depth of 5m (n=73) was measured at 19 sampling occasions at the LaoYeManQu watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). At a depth of 0-1.5m, the annual mean SWS was highly correlated with rain intensity, and the correlation decreased with depth, but within the layers at 1.5-5.0m, the changes in SWS indicated a lag between precipitation and the replenishment of soil water. Geostatistical parameters of SWS were also highly dependent on depth, and the mean SWS presented similar spatial structures in two adjacent layers. Temporal stability of SWS as indicated by mean relative difference, standard deviation of the relative difference (SDRD), and mean absolute bias error (MABE) was significantly weaker at the shallow than at deeper layers. Soil separates and organic carbon content controlled the spatial pattern of SWS at the watershed scale. One representative location (Site 57) was identified to estimate the mean SWS in the 1- to 5-m layer of the watershed. Semivariograms of the SDRD and MABE were best fitted by an isotropic spherical model, and their spatial distributions were depth-dependent. Both temporal stability and spatial variability of SWS increased over depth. This study is helpful for deep SWS estimation and sustainable management of soil and water on the CLP, and for other similar regions around the world.

AB Land cover has been increasingly recognized as an important factor affecting hydrologic processes at the basin and regional level. Therefore, improved understanding of how land cover change affects hydrologic systems is needed for better management of water resources. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of land cover change on the duration and severity of high and low flows by using the Soil Water Assessment Tool model, Bayesian model averaging and copulas. Two basins dominated by different land cover in the Ohio River basin are used as study area in this study. Two historic land covers from the 1950s and 1990s are considered as input to the Soil Water Assessment Tool model, thereby investigating the hydrologic high and low flow response of different land cover conditions of these two basins. The relationships between the duration and severity of both low and high flow are defined by applying the copula method; changes in the frequency of the duration and severity are investigated. The results show that land cover changes affect both the duration and severity of both high and low flows. An increase in forest area leads to a decrease in the duration and severity during both high and low flows, but its impact is highest during extreme flows. The results also show that the land cover changes have had significant influences on changes in the joint return periods of duration and severity of low and high flows. While this study sheds light on the role of land cover change on severity and duration of high and low flow conditions, more studies using various land cover conditions and climate types are required in order to draw more reliable conclusions in the future.

AB Testing the relative performances of the single ring pressure infiltrometer (PI) and simplified falling head (SFH) techniques to determine the field saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, K-fs, at the near point scale may help to better establish the usability of these techniques for interpreting and simulating hydrological processes. A sampling of 10 Sicilian sites showed that the measured K-fs was generally higher with the SFH technique than the PI one, with statistically significant differences by a factor varying from 3 to 192, depending on the site. A short experiment with the SFH technique yielded higher K-fs values because a longer experiment with the PI probably promoted short-term swelling phenomena reducing macroporosity. Moreover, the PI device likely altered the infiltration surface at the beginning of the run, particularly in the less stable soils, where soil particle arrangement may be expected to vary upon wetting. This interpretation was supported by a soil structure stability index, SSI, and also by the hydraulic conductivity data obtained with the tension infiltrometer, i.e. with a practically negligible disturbance of the sampled soil surface. In particular, a statistically significant, increasing relationship with SSI and an unsaturated conductivity greater than the saturated one were only detected for the K-fs data obtained with the PI. The SFH and PI techniques should be expected to yield more similar results in relatively rigid porous media (low percentages of fine particles and structurally stable soils) than in soils that modify appreciably their particle arrangement upon wetting. The simultaneous use of the two techniques may allow to improve K-fs determination in soils that change their hydrodynamic behaviour during a runoff producing rainfall event.

AB Understanding the temporal changes in river water quality is important for catchment water quality management. This study aims to detect and attribute long-term trends and abrupt changes in river water quality. We used 26 years of water quality data (1994-2020) collected from 102 river monitoring sites across Victoria, south-eastern Australia. We analysed six water quality constituents that are of key concerns for Australian catchment management, namely: electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solids, nitrate-nitrite, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorous and filtered reactive phosphorus. To detect trends and abrupt changes in water quality at each site, a Bayesian ensemble modelling approach was applied, namely, the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change, seasonal change, and trend (BEAST). To explain water quality trends, we then built multivariate regressions to link water quality with streamflow and seasonality, and then compared alternative model structures with and without a change in the regression relationships informed by the changes detected by BEAST. Among the six constituents studied, EC shows the most distinct systematic trends, with 21 sites having a significant increase followed by a non-significant trend; within the 21 sites, 14 had a significant change point in EC around Year 2010. The regression analyses between water quality and streamflow suggested that the observed systematic change in EC could be largely related to reduced streamflow during the Millennium drought, which greatly impacted the climate and hydrology of south-eastern Australia over the first decade of 2000. The results of this study can help inform the design of effective mitigation strategies and avoid further degradation of water quality across Victoria. Besides, our trend analysis and attribution approaches are applicable to water quality time series in other regions for robust trend analysis and change point detection.

AB Vegetation plays a significant role in preventing desertification, conservation of soil and water. However, nowadays, there is still uncertainty regarding the mechanisms of flow resistance caused by dissimilar vegetation covers. To address this gap, a series of these was conducted in this study to investigate the influence of synthetic grass and stems on the variation of resistance on overland flows. Thirty vegetation configurations were selected (combining five synthetic grass coverage options and six synthetic stem coverage ones), and tested against five unit discharges (flow range = 0.28-2.22 L m(-1) s(-1)) and four slope gradients (3.49%-20.78%). The results obtained showed that the unit discharge is the key driving factor for the transition from laminar to transitional flow. Furthermore, the relationship between the resistance coefficient (f) and the Reynolds number (Re) was not monotonically increasing or decreasing, but behaviours observed were specifically linked to each vegetation coverage. However, a critical coverage threshold was identified, and it corresponded to 2.72% when the slope gradient tested was 3.49%. This threshold decreased with the increase of the slope gradient. In addition, when the vegetation coverage was less than the critical threshold, the f was negatively correlated with Re, otherwise if the vegetation coverage was higher than the critical threshold identified the f-Re relation was positively correlated. The total flow resistance under synthetic grass and stem cover was unequal to the linear superposition of grain resistance and form resistance caused by synthetic stem and grass, which meant that the linear superposition approach is not applicable to overland flows. Finally, a model was developed to predict the flow resistance by applying the pi-theorem and the multiple nonlinear regression analysis and it has been validated against the experimental results confirming its accuracy and high performance (adj.R-2 = 0.99, NSE = 0.94).

AB The US Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service Southeast Watershed Research Laboratory (SEWRL) initiated a hydrologic research program on the Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW) in 1967. Long-term (52 years) streamflow data are available for nine sites, including rainfall-runoff relationships and hydrograph characteristics regularly used in research on interactive effects of climate, vegetation, soils, and land-use in low-gradient streams of the US EPA Level III Southeastern Plains ecoregion. A summary of prior research on the LREW illustrates the impact of the watershed on building a regional understanding of hydrology and water quality. Climatic and streamflow data were used to make comparisons of scale across the nine nested LREW watersheds (LRB, LRF, LRI, LRJ, LRK, LRO, LRN, LRM, and LRO3) and two regional watersheds (Alapaha and Little River at Adel). Annual rainfall for the largest LREW, LRB, was 1200 mm while average annual streamflow was 320 mm. Annual rainfall, streamflow, and the ratio between annual streamflow and rainfall (Sratio) were similar (alpha = 0.05) across LREWs LRB, LRF, LRI, LRJ, LRK, and LRO. While annual rainfall within the 275 ha LRO3 was found to be similar to LRO and LRM (alpha = 0.05), annual streamflow and Sratio were significantly different (alpha = 0.05). Comparisons of annual rainfall, streamflow, and Sratio between LRB and the regional watersheds indicated no differences (alpha = 0.05). Based upon this analysis, most regional watersheds shared similar hydrologic characteristics. LRO3 was an exception, where increases in row crops and decreases in forest coverage resulted in increased streamflow. LREW data have been instrumental in building considerable scientific understanding of flow and transport processes for these stream systems. Continued operation of the LREW hydrologic network will support hydrologic research as well as environmental quality and riparian research programs that address emerging and high priority natural resource and environmental issues.

AB This study examined the weekly water vapour isotopic composition (delta O-18(v)) in Thailand. The water vapour was cryogenically collected from eight sites across the country. Two observational samples were collected over one 24-h period each week (a daytime and a night-time sample), from September 2013 to September 2014. The primary aim was to investigate the environmental factors influencing water vapour isotopes. The results revealed differences in water vapour isotopic values between day and night samples. Three periods of depleted delta O-18(v) were associated with large-scale convective systems in September, December, and May. The statistical relationship between the climate variables and water vapour isotopes indicated that the amount of precipitation and relative humidity were the primary controls on both diurnal and seasonal isotopic variability. The temperature did not affect the delta O-18(v), mainly because the atmospheric processes are a function of vertical convection rather than temperature in tropical regions. The water vapour deuterium excess (d-excess) showed greater variability in 2013 than in 2014. The d-excess variation reflected the differences in convection occurring in the day and night. In addition, the vapour phase data were combined with the local meteoric water line to identify the local water vapour line and the interaction between the isotopic composition of water vapour and liquid water. The water vapour isotopic patterns paralleled the precipitation isotopes on rainy days because of equilibrium isotopic exchange. Water vapour and precipitation were isotopically similar under low humidity but showed greater differences from each other under wetter conditions. The study results provide insight into water vapour isotopic characteristics in tropical regions and constrain the role of large-scale atmospheric processes relative to isotopic variability of water vapour in Thailand and nearby countries.

AB This study develops improved Soil Moisture Proxies (SMP) based suspended sediment yield (SMPSY) models corresponding to three antecedent moisture conditions (AMCs) (i.e., AMC-I-AMC-III) by coupling the improved initial abstraction (I-a-lambda) model, the SMA procedure and the SMP concept for modelling the rainfall generated suspended sediment yield. The SMPSY models specifically incorporate a watershed storage index (S) model to accentuate the transformation from storm to storm and to avoid the sudden jumps in sediment yield computation. The workability of the SMPSY models is tested using a large dataset of rainfall and sediment yield (98 storm events) from twelve small watersheds and a comparison has been made with the existing MSY model. The goodness-of-fit (GOF) statistics is evaluated in terms of the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and error indices, i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (nRMSE), standard error (SE), mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). The NSE values vary from 74.31% to 96.57% and from 75.21% to 91.78%, respectively for the SPMSY and MSY model. The NSE statistics indicate that the SMPSY model has lower uncertainty in simulating sediment yield as compared to the MSY model. The error indices are lower for the SMPSY model than the MSY model for most of the watersheds. These results show that the SMPSY model has less uncertainty and performs better than the MSY model. A sensitivity analysis of the SMPSY model shows that the parameter beta is most sensitive followed by parameter S, alpha and A. Overall, the results show that the characterization of soil moisture variability in terms of SMPs and incorporation of improved delivery ratio and runoff coefficient relationship improves the simulation of the erosion and sediment yield generation process.

AB The development of surface hydrological connectivity is a key determinant of flood magnitude in drylands. Thresholds in runoff response may be reached when isolated runoff-generating areas connect with each other to form continuous links to river channels, enabling these areas to contribute to flood hydrographs. Such threshold behaviour explains observed nonlinearities and scale dependencies of dryland rainfall-runoff relationships and complicates attempts at flood prediction. However, field methods for measuring the propensity of a surface to transmit water downslope are lacking, and conventional techniques of infiltration measurement are often inappropriate for use on non-agricultural drylands. Here, we argue for a reconceptualization of the dryland surface runoff process, suggesting that the downslope transfer of water should be considered alongside surface infiltration; that is, there is a need for the "aggregated" measurement of infiltration and overland flow hydraulics. Surface application of a set volume of water at a standardized rate generates runoff that travels downslope; the distance it travels downslope is determined by infiltration along the flow, integration of flow paths, and flow resistance. We demonstrate the potential of such a combined measurement system coupled with structure-from-motion photogrammetry to identify surface controls on runoff generation and transfer on dryland hillslopes, with vegetation, slope, surface stone cover, and surface roughness all having a significant effect. The measurement system has been used on slopes up to 37 degrees compared with the flat surface typically required for infiltration methods. On average, the field workflow takes similar to 10-15 min, considerably quicker than rainfall simulation. A wider variety of surfaces can be sampled with relative ease, as the method is not restricted to stone and vegetation-free land. We argue that this aggregated measurement represents surface connectivity and dryland runoff response better than standard hydrological approaches and can be applied on a much greater variety of dryland surfaces.

AB Scenario-neutral assessments of climate change impact on floods analyse the sensitivity of a catchment to a range of changes in selected meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation. The key challenges of the approach are the choice of the meteorological variables and statistics thereof and how to generate time series representing altered climatologies of the selected variables. Different methods have been proposed to achieve this, and it remains unclear if and to which extent they result in comparable flood change projections. Here, we compare projections of annual maximum floods (AMFs) derived from three different scenario-neutral methods for a prealpine study catchment. The methods chosen use different types of meteorological data, namely, observations, regional climate model output, and weather generator data. The different time series account for projected changes in the seasonality of temperature and precipitation, in the occurrence statistics of precipitation, and of daily precipitation extremes. Resulting change in mean AMF peak magnitudes and volumes differs in sign between the methods (range of -6% to +7% for flood peak magnitudes and -11% to +14% for flood volumes). Moreover, variability of projected peak magnitudes and flood volumes depends on method with one approach leading to a generally larger spread. The differences between the methods vary depending on whether peak magnitudes or flood volumes are considered and different relationships between peak magnitude and volume change result. These findings can be linked to differing flood regime changes among the three approaches. The study highlights that considering selected aspects of climate change only when performing scenario-neutral studies may lead to differing representations of flood generating processes by the approaches and thus different quantifications of flood change. As each method comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, it is recommended to combine several scenario-neutral approaches to obtain more robust results.

ID EROSION INDEX; PRECIPITATION
AB Changes in rainfall erosivity are an expected consequence of climate change. Long-term series of the single storm erosion index, EI, may be analysed to detect trends in rainfall erosivity. An indirect approach has to be applied for estimating EI, given that long series of rainfall intensities are seldom available. In this paper, a method for estimating EI from the corresponding rainfall amount, h(e,) was developed for Sicily. This method was then applied at 17 Sicilian locations, representative of different climatic zones of the region, to generate a long series (i.e. from 1916 to 1999 in most cases) of El values. Linear and step (step located at 1970) trends in annual and seasonal erosivity were detected by both classical approaches (Mann-Kendall test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test) and a new empirical approach (quantile approach, QA), based on the determination of the erosivity values corresponding to selected probability levels. A power relationship between EI and h, with a space and time-variable scale factor and a time-variable process parameter yielded the most accurate predictions of EL However, a simpler model, using a time-variable scale factor and a constant process parameter, yielded reasonably accurate El estimates. Annual erosivity did not increase in Sicily during the twentieth century. At the most, it decreased at a few locations (three of the 17 considered locations). Significant trends were observed more frequently for winter erosivity (six locations) than for summer erosivity (two locations), suggesting that the erosive storms of winter determined the occasional occurrence of a negative trend in annual erosivity. In general, the QA compared reasonably well with more classical approaches. The QA appears promising since step trends for different return periods may be detected but efforts are needed to statistically formalize the proposed approach.

AB Integrated dynamic water and chloride balance models with a catchment-scale hydrological model (PRMS) are used to investigate the response of a terminal tropical lake, Lake Abiyata, to climate variability and water use practices in its catchment. The hydrological model is used to investigate the response of the catchment to different climate and land-use change scenarios that are incorporated into the lake model. Lake depth-area-volume relationships were established from lake bathymetries. Missing data in the time series were filled using statistical regression techniques. Based on mean monthly data, the lake water balance model produced a good agreement between the simulated and observed levels of Lake Abiyata for the period 1968-83. From 1984 onwards the simulated lake level is overestimated with respect to the observed one, while the chloride concentration is largely underestimated. This discrepancy is attributed to human use of water from the influent rivers or directly from the lake. The simulated lake level and chloride concentration are in better agreement with observed values (r(2) = 0(.)96) when human water use for irrigation and salt exploitation are included in the model. A comparison of the simulation with and without human consumption indicates that climate variability controls the interannual fluctuations and that the human water use affects the equilibrium of the system by strongly reducing the lake level. Sensitivity analysis based on a mean climatic year showed that, after prolonged mean climatic conditions, Lake Abiyata reacts more rapidly to an abrupt shift to wetter conditions than to dry conditions. This study shows the significant sensitivity of the level and salinity of the terminal Lake Abiyata to small changes in climate or land use, making it a very good 'recorder' of environmental changes that may occur in the catchment at different time scales.

AB Indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions produced by nitrogen (N) leaching into surface water and groundwater bodies are poorly understood in comparison to direct N2O emissions from soils. In this study, dissolved N2O concentrations were measured weekly in both lowland headwater streams and subsurface agricultural field drain discharges over a 2-year period (2013-2015) in an intensive arable catchment, Norfolk, UK. All field drain and stream water samples were found to have dissolved N2O concentrations higher than the water-air equilibrium concentration, illustrating that all sites were acting as a net source of N2O emissions to the atmosphere. Soil texture was found to significantly influence field drain N2O dynamics, with mean concentrations from drains in clay loam soils (5.3gNL(-1)) being greater than drains in sandy loam soils (4.0gNL(-1)). Soil texture also impacted upon the relationships between field drain N2O concentrations and other water quality parameters (pH, flow rate, and nitrate (NO3) and nitrite (NO2) concentrations), highlighting possible differences in N2O production mechanisms in different soil types. Catchment antecedent moisture conditions influenced the storm event mobilisation of N2O in both field drains and streams, with the greatest concentration increases recorded during precipitation events preceded by prolonged wet conditions. N2O concentrations also varied seasonally, with the lowest mean concentrations typically occurring during the summer months (JJA). Nitrogen fertiliser application rates and different soil inversion regimes were found to have no effect on dissolved N2O concentrations, whereas higher N2O concentrations recorded in field drains under a winter cover crop compared to fallow fields revealed cover crops are an ineffective greenhouse gas emission mitigation strategy. Overall, this study highlights the complex interactions governing the dynamics of dissolved N2O concentrations in field drains and headwater streams in a lowland intensive agricultural catchment.

AB The inherent effects of global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies on hydrological cycle and vegetation cover complicate the structure of tropical climate at the regional scale. Assessing hydrological processes related to climate forcing is important in Central America because it is surrounded by both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and two continental landmasses. In this study, the use of high-resolution remote sensing imagery in wavelet analysis helps identify nonstationary characteristics of hydrological and ecological responses. The wavelet-based empirical orthogonal function (WEOF) further reflects the nonlinear relationship between the Atlantic and Pacific SST and the greenness of a pristine forested site in Panama, La Amistad International Park. Integrated WEOF and descriptive statistics for data analysis reveal a higher temporal variability in terrestrial precipitation relative to in situ land surface temperature and its probable effects on the presence of dry periods. Such teleconnection signals of SST were identified as a driving force of decline in tropical forest greenness during dry periods. The results of our remote sensing-based wavelet analysis showed intra-annual high-frequency and biennial to triennial low-frequency signals between enhanced vegetation index/precipitation datasets and SST indices in both Atlantic and Pacific oceans. A spatiotemporal priority search further confirmed the importance of the effects of the El Nico-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) over terrestrial responses in the selected study site. Coincidence of the effect of ENSO teleconnection patterns on precipitation and vegetation suggests possible impacts of El Nico-associated droughts in Central America, accompanied by reduced rainfall, especially during the first months of rainy season (June, July, and August), and decline in vegetation cover during the dry season (March and April).

TI A shrub bending model to calculate the albedo of shrub-tundra
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES

ID SNOW; INTERCEPTION; FLUXES; SCHEME
AB At high latitudes, the albedo and energy budget of shrub-tundra landscapes is determined by the relationship between the fractional snow cover and the fraction of vegetation protruding above the snowpack. The exposed vegetation fraction is affected by the bending and/or burial of shrubs in winter and their spring-up during melt. Little is known about the meteorological conditions and snowpack and shrub properties required to cause bending, and few quantitative measurements of bending processes exist. Here, a model combining the few, mostly qualitative, observations available with a biomechanical model representing branches as cantilevers is proposed to provide a first approximation of bending mechanisms. The exposed vegetation fraction is then calculated using structural parameters of shrubs measured at two sites in Canada: the Granger Basin in the Yukon Territory and Trail Valley Creek in the Northwest Territories. The exposed vegetation fraction is in turn used to calculate albedo, which is evaluated against measurements at the two sites. The model considerably improves modelled albedo compared to a model which only buries but does not bend shrubs at TVC, where shrubs become completely buried. However, the model overestimates albedo at GB where only a few shrubs get buried. The bending model is then used to calculate a compression factor for use in a simple parameterization of the exposed vegetation fraction proposed by previous investigators. The parameterization, which is simpler and computationally less expensive than the full model, is evaluated and found to perform well. Despite the need for further developments, the model provides a first approximation of bending processes and contributes to the identification of measurements that are needed in order to improve the model and our understanding of the bending of shrubs.

AB Methane emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs can comprise a considerable portion of anthropogenic methane. However, lack of data on CH4 emissions in different geographical regions and high spatial-temporal variability in the emission rates of reservoirs has led to uncertainties regarding regional emission estimates of CH4. In the subtropical plateau climate region, we used the Ertan hydroelectric reservoir as a study area. The CH4 flux at the air-water interface was assessed by floating chambers and factors influencing emissions, including the distance from the dam, water depth, seasonal variation in wet and dry season, air-water temperature gradient and wind speed, and was also studied through a year-long systematic sampling and monitoring experiment. The results showed that the surface of the reservoir was a source of CH4 during the sampling period and the annual average CH4 flux was 2.80 +/- 1.52 mg m(-2) d(-1). CH4 flux (and its variation) was higher in the shallow water areas than in the deep-water areas. CH4 flux near the dam was significantly higher than that of other locations farther from the dam in the dry season. The seasonal variations of CH4 emission in wet and dry seasons were minor and significant diurnal variations were observed in wet and dry seasons. Exponential relationships between the CH4 flux and air-water temperature gradient were found. Air-water temperature gradient was an important factor influencing diurnal variations of CH4 flux in the Ertan hydroelectric reservoir. These results indicate that systematic sampling is needed to better estimate CH4 flux through coverage of the spatial variation of different water depths, measuring-point distance from the dam, seasonal variation in wet and dry seasons and changes in climate factors (such as air-water temperature gradient). Our results also provide a fundamental parameter for CH4 emission estimation of global reservoirs. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationships of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices and the Blue Nile River Basin hydrology using a new approach that tracks cumulative ENSO indices. The results of this study call be applied for water resources management decision making to mitigate drought or flood impacts with a lead time of at least few months. ENSO tracking and forecasting is relatively easier than predicting hydrology. ENSO teleconnections to the Blue Nile River Basin hydrology were evaluated using spatial average basin rainfall and Blue Nile flows at Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. The ENSO indices were sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in region Nino 3.4 and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The analysis indicates that the Upper Blue Nile Basin rainfall and flows are teleconnected to the ENSO indices. Based on event correspondence and correlation analysis, high rainfall and high flows are likely to occur during La Nina years and dry years are likely to occur during El Nino years at a confidence level of 90%. Extreme dry and wet years are very likely to correspond with ENSO events as given above. The great Ethiopian famine of 1888-1892 corresponds to one of the strongest El Nino years, 1888. The recent drought years in Ethiopia correspond to strong El Nino years and wet years correspond to La Nina years. In this paper, a new approach is proposed on how to classify the strength of ENSO events by tracking consecutive monthly events through a year. A cumulative SST index value of >= 5 and cumulative SOI value of <=-7 indicate strong El Nino. A Cumulative SST index value of <=-5 and cumulative SOI index of >= 7 indicate strong La Nina.

AB Due to its complex interactions with various processes and factors, soil moisture exhibits significant spatial variability across different spatial scales. In this study, a modeling approach and field observations were used to examine the soil control on the relationship between mean ((theta) over bar) and standard deviation (sigma(theta)) of soil moisture content. For the numerical experiments, a 1-D vadose zone model along with van Genuchten parameters generated by pedotransfer functions was used for simulating soil moisture dynamics under different climate and surface conditions. To force the model, hydrometeorological and physiological data that spanned over three years from five research sites within the continental US were used. The modeling results showed that under bare surface conditions, different forms of the (theta) over bar-sigma(theta) relationship as observed in experimental studies were produced. For finer soils, a positive (theta) over bar-sigma(theta) relationship gradually changed to an upward convex and a negative one from arid to humid conditions; whereas, a positive relationship existed for coarser soils, regardless of climatic conditions. The maximum sigma(theta) for finer soils was larger under semiarid conditions than under arid and humid conditions, while the maximum sigma(theta) for coarser soils increased with increasing precipitation. Moreover, vegetation tended to reduce sigma(theta) and sigma(theta), and thus affected the (theta) over bar-sigma(theta) relationship. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to examine the controls of different van Genuchten parameters on the (theta) over bar-sigma(theta) relationship under bare surface conditions. It was found that the residual soil moisture content mainly affected sigma(theta) under dry conditions, while the saturated soil moisture content and the saturated hydraulic conductivity largely controlled sigma(theta) under wet conditions. Importantly, the upward convex (theta) over bar-sigma(theta) relationship was mostly caused by the shape factor n that accounts for pore size distribution. Finally, measured soil moisture data from a semiarid region were retrieved from the Automated Weather Data Network. The observed moisture data showed that based on soil texture, a positive (theta) over bar-sigma(theta) relationship existed for sandy soils, while an upward convex one was observed for silty soils. The difference in the observed (theta) over bar -sigma(theta) relationship can be attributed to the differences in water holding capacities between sand and silt, which is consistent with the modeling results. The field data also revealed that increasing spatial variability in soil texture led to increased variability in soil moisture (e.g., the maximum sigma(theta)). Therefore, the effect of soil texture for verifying remotely sensed soil moisture products should be considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To study the hyporheic exchange driven by a single peak flood-induced water level fluctuation (i.e., flood wave), a method combining numerical simulation with theoretical derivation was proposed based on the Inbuk Stream, Korea, where flooding occurs frequently. The hyporheic exchanges induced by different flood waves were investigated by varying amplitude (A), duration (T), wave type parameter (r), and rising duration (t(p)), which were adopted from the real-time stream stage fluctuations. Additionally, the idea of constant upstream flood volume (CUFV) condition for flood waves was put forward, and the effects of "Botan" (T/A) and peak number (N) on hyporheic exchange were studied. The results showed that the hyporheic exchange flux (q) was controlled by the water level h (sine-type) and its change rate v (cosine-type), and was proportional to the polynomial of them q proportional to (omega center dot h + v), where omega is the angular frequency of the flood wave. Based on this mechanism, the influence principles on hyporheic exchanges of the typical flood wave parameters (A, T, r and t(p)) as well as T/A and N under CUFV condition were clarified. The main characteristic variables of hyporheic exchange, which were maximum aquifer storage and residence time, were positively correlated. They also had positive relations to the integral of the flood wave over time, which increased when the wave became higher, wider, rounder and less skewed. However, when CUFV condition was imposed, the residence time was positively correlated with T/A, whereas the maximum aquifer storage was negatively correlated with T/A. With the increase in N, water exchanged more frequently and some water returned to the stream early, leading to the slight decrease in maximum aquifer storage and residence time. These findings enriched the theory of hyporheic exchange driven by surface water fluctuation and be of great significance to enhance pollutant degradation in the hyporheic zone downstream of reservoirs.

AB The complex ecohydrological processes of rangelands can be studied through the framework of ecological sites (ESs) or hillslope-scale soil-vegetation complexes. High-quality hydrologic field investigations are needed to quantitatively link ES characteristics to hydrologic function. Geophysical tools are useful in this context because they provide valuable information about the subsurface at appropriate spatial scales. We conducted 20 field experiments in which we deployed time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), variable intensity rainfall simulation, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), and seismic refraction, on hillslope plots at five different ESs within the Upper Crow Creek Watershed in south-east Wyoming. Surface runoff was measured using a precalibrated flume. Infiltration data from the rainfall simulations, coupled with site-specific resistivity-water content relationships and ERT datasets, were used to spatially and temporally track the progression of the wetting front. First-order constraints on subsurface structure were made at each ES using the geophysical methods. Sites ranged from infiltrating 100% of applied rainfall to infiltrating less than 60%. Analysis of covariance results indicated significant differences in the rate of wetting front progression, ranging from 0.346 m min(-1/2) for sites with a subsurface dominated by saprolitic material to 0.156 m min(-1/2) for sites with a well-developed soil profile. There was broad agreement in subsurface structure between the geophysical methods with GPR typically providing the most detail. Joint interpretation of the geophysics showed that subsurface features such as soil layer thickness and the location of subsurface obstructions such as granite corestones and material boundaries had a large effect on the rate of infiltration and subsurface flow processes. These features identified through the geophysics varied significantly by ES. By linking surface hydrologic information from the rainfall simulations with subsurface information provided by the geophysics, we can characterize the ES-specific hydrologic response. Both surface and subsurface flow processes differed among sites and are directly linked to measured characteristics.

AB Shallow aquifers typically have greater hydrologic connectivity and response to recharge and changes in surface water management practices than deeper aquifers and are therefore often managed to reduce the risk of flooding. Quantification of the water table elevation response under different management scenarios provides valuable information in shallow aquifer systems to assess indirect influences of such modifications. The episodic master recession method was applied to the 15-min water table elevation and NEXRAD rainfall data for 6 wells to identify water table response and individual rainfall events. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of rainfall, water table elevation, canal stage, site-specific characteristics, and canal structure modification/water management practice on the fluctuations in water table elevations using multiple/stepwise multiple linear regression techniques. With the modification of canal structure and operation adjustment, significant difference existed in water table response in the southern wells due to its relative downstream position regarding the general groundwater flow direction and the structural modification locations. On average, water table response height and flood risk were lower after than before the structure modification to canals. The effect of rainfall event size on the height of water table response was greater than the effect of antecedent water table elevation and canal stage on the height of water table response. Other factors including leakance of the canal bed sediment, specific yield, and rainfall on i-1day had significant effects on the height of water table response as well. Antecedent water table elevation and canal stage had greater and more linear effects on the height of water table response after the management changes to canals. Variation in water table response height/rainfall event size ratio was attributed to difference in S-y, antecedent soil water content, hydraulic gradient, rainfall size, and run-off ratio. After the structure modification, water table response height/rainfall event size ratio demonstrated more linear and proportional relationship with antecedent water table elevation and canal stage.

AB The study of how cave drip-water discharge responds to recharge events is fundamental to evaluating the potential of actively forming speleothems as high-resolution climate archives. Most previous research has focused on caves of the Northern Hemisphere middle latitudes, where recharge is strongly seasonal. Few studies have explored drip-water behaviour from regions where the expected seasonal rainfall pattern is significantly perturbed on an irregular basis by changing regional atmospheric circulation patterns. Here, we report the results of a 4-year study of cave drip-water-climate relationships from two caves in eastern Australia. The discharge of 10 drip sites located beneath bedrock thicknesses of 12, 22 and 45 m was monitored either continuously (using automated infrared sensors) or at discrete approximately monthly intervals and compared with local rainfall and water balance data. The study period traversed two major droughts, including the severe 2002-2003 El Ni (n) over tildeo. Drips at 12 and 22 m depths responded almost simultaneously to individual recharge events, although the time lag between individual events varied according to the volume of recharge and pre-event storage. Overall, a steady decline in discharge is evident through the moisture-deficit period, with increased flows through phases of positive water balance. Speleothems growing at these and similar shallow-chamber sites have potential for reconstructing palaeo-rainfall trends at high-resolution, although the highly variable nature of year-to-year recharge would make it difficult to obtain data on a calendrical time-scale. Drips at 45 m depth did not respond consistently to individual recharge events and displayed hydrological behaviour markedly dissimilar to one another and to the near-surface drip sites, indicating great complexity in karst architecture and the absence of fissure flow. Although speleothems at this depth may well preserve information on longer-term rainfall trends, their potential to encode a palaeo-rainfall variability signal at interannual resolution is poor.

AB Knowing little about how porosity and permeability are distributed at depth, we commonly develop models of groundwater by treating the subsurface as a homogeneous black box even though porosity and permeability vary with depth. One reason for this depth variation is that infiltrating meteoric water reacts with minerals to affect porosity in localized zones called reaction fronts. We are beginning to learn to map and model these fronts beneath headwater catchments and show how they are distributed. The subsurface landscapes defined by these fronts lie subparallel to the soil-air interface but with lower relief. They can be situated above, below, or at the water table. These subsurface landscapes of reaction are important because porosity developed from weathering can control subsurface water storage. In addition, porosity often changes at the weathering fronts, and when this affects permeability significantly, the front can act like a valve that re-orients water flowing through the subsurface. We explore controls on the positions of reaction fronts under headwater landscapes by accounting for the timescales of erosion, chemical equilibration, and solute transport. One strong control on the landscape of subsurface reaction is the land surface geometry, which is in turn a function of the erosion rate. In addition, the reaction fronts, like the water table, are strongly affected by the lithology and water infiltration rate. We hypothesize that relationships among the land surface, reaction fronts, and the water table are controlled by feedbacks that can push landscapes towards an 'ideal hill'. In this steady state, reaction-front valves partition water volumes into shallow and deep flowpaths. These flows dissolve low- and high-solubility minerals, respectively, allowing their reaction fronts to advance at the erosion rate. This conceptualization could inform better models of subsurface porosity and permeability, replacing the black box.

AB Many downscaling techniques have been developed in the past few years for projection of station-scale hydrological variables from large-scale atmospheric variables simulated by general circulation models (GCMs) to assess the hydrological impacts of climate change. This article compares the performances of three downscaling methods, viz. conditional random field (CRF), K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) methods in downscaling precipitation in the Punjab region of India, belonging to the monsoon regime. The CRF model is a recently developed method for downscaling hydrological variables in a probabilistic framework, while the SVM model is a popular machine learning tool useful in terms of its ability to generalize and capture nonlinear relationships between predictors and predictand. The KNN model is an analogue-type method that queries days similar to a given feature vector from the training data and classifies future days by random sampling from a weighted set of K closest training examples. The models are applied for downscaling monsoon (June to September) daily precipitation at six locations in Punjab. Model performances with respect to reproduction of various statistics such as dry and wet spell length distributions, daily rainfall distribution, and intersite correlations are examined. It is found that the CRF and KNN models perform slightly better than the SVM model in reproducing most daily rainfall statistics. These models are then used to project future precipitation at the six locations. Output from the Canadian global climate model (CGCM3) GCM for three scenarios, viz. A1B, A2, and B1 is used for projection of future precipitation. The projections show a change in probability density functions of daily rainfall amount and changes in the wet and dry spell distributions of daily precipitation.

AB This study intends to bridge the gap between global- and local-scale hydrological studies in the Amazon basin by assessing the hydrological response of the Negro basin. The large basin model from the Institute of Hydraulic Research (MGB-IPH hydrological model) has been used to simulate the hydrological processes over the basin during the period 1997-2006. The model was forced with a precipitation field for the Amazon basin derived from the Hybam observatory and climatological data provided by NCEP. Calibration and validation procedures were developed based on daily discharge datasets from 22 gauge stations. In addition, this paper focusses on ENVISAT spatial altimetry data from 27 virtual stations (VS). The spatial altimetry datasets were used as a complement to the model validation. For each computational cell, water heights could be derived from a robust discharge x height relationship generalized to most parts of the basin. The modelled discharges and water heights feature adequate performance levels at gauge and VS along the main river and tributaries with drainage areas varying from 5900 to 712 500 km(2). Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of modelled discharges varied from 0.47 to 0.94 and correlation coefficients of water heights averaged 0.86 for the entire basin. According to the water balance provided by the model, the amount of precipitation received over the basin is 7.2 mm day(-1) during the study period with an evapotranspiration (ET) rate of 3.2 mm day(-1). The model could also capture the different ET rates over the basin, as presented in previous studies. Results suggest relatively low ET values in the Northern basin, in the Roraima State, of about 3.1 mm day(-1), and higher values near Manaus (3.8 mm day(-1)).

AB Lakes basins cover wide extents of many Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) landscapes and thus are integral components of hydrological processes. Observed variation in runoff responses between two adjacent catchments being monitored pre- and post-development in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) suggested the need to better understand how lake basins, both current lakes and drained lake basins (DLBs), modify flow regimes. A progressive increase in summer rainfall over this monitoring period, 2009-2019, also provided an opportunity to assess how watershed characteristics interacted with hydrologic intensification. Stream gauging records from eight other nearby catchments ranging from 16 to 270 km(2) with varying extents of lakes (14%-47%) and DLBs (5%-57%) expanded our analysis of ACP hydrology. Wider DLB extent corresponded to higher and more rapid snowmelt peak flows and this relationship also became evident during rainstorms in summers with high antecedent surface storage. Mean annual runoff and summer low-flows were best explained by extent of connected lakes. Over this period of increasing summer rainfall, all hydrograph responses became more closely related to the full extent of lake basins suggesting expanding connectivity. Our final year of complete hydrologic records in 2019 was punctuated by a 30-mm late-summer rainfall event, which generated flow peaks nearly exceeding snowmelt runoff at several gauges, specifically ones with high extent of DLBs. This rain-event response underscored the increasing need to include both lakes and DLBs in models of ACP watershed hydrology. An improved understanding of catchment-scale controls on variable hydrologic responses will be increasingly essential for mitigating hazards to new and existing development, predicting floods, drought, and water supply, and protecting aquatic ecosystem functioning and habitat as the Arctic hydrologic cycle intensifies and development expands.

AB Understanding the interplay between hydrological flushing and biogeochemical cycling in streams is now possible owing to advances in high-frequency water quality measurements with in situ sensors. It is often assumed that storm events are periods when biogeochemical processes become suppressed and longitudinal transport of solutes and particulates dominates. However, high-frequency data show that diel cycles are a common feature of water quality time series and can be preserved during storm events, especially those of low-magnitude. In this study, we mine a high-frequency dataset and use two key hydrochemical indices, hysteresis and flushing index to evaluate the diversity of concentration-discharge relationships in third order agricultural stream. We show that mobilization patterns, inferred from the hysteresis index, change on a seasonal basis, with a predominance of rapid mobilization from surface and near stream sources during winter high-magnitude storm events and of delayed mobilization from subsurface sources during summer low-magnitude storm events. Using dynamic harmonic regression, we were able to separate concentration signals during storm events into hydrological flushing (using trend as a proxy) and biogeochemical cycling (using amplitude of a diel cycle as a proxy). We identified three groups of water quality parameters depending on their typical c-q response: flushing dominated parameters (phosphorus and sediments), mixed flushing and cycling parameters (nitrate nitrogen, specific conductivity and pH) and cycling dominated parameters (dissolved oxygen, redox potential and water temperature). Our results show that despite large storm to storm diversity in hydrochemical responses, storm event magnitude and timing have a critical role in controlling the type of mobilization, flushing and cycling behaviour of each water quality constituent. Hydrochemical indices can be used to fingerprint the effect of hydrological disturbance on freshwater quality and can be useful in determining the impacts of global change on stream ecology.

AB Detailed knowledge of the flood period of Arctic rivers remains one of the few factors impeding rigorous prediction of the effect of climate change on carbon and related element fluxes from the land to the Arctic Ocean. In order to test the temporal and spatial variability of element concentration in the Ob River (western Siberia) water during flood period and to quantify the contribution of spring flood period to the annual element export, we sampled the main channel year round in 2014-2017 for dissolved C, major, and trace element concentrations. We revealed high stability (approximately <= 10% relative variation) of dissolved C, major, and trace element concentrations in the Ob River during spring flood period over a 1-km section of the river channel and over 3 days continuous monitoring (3-hr frequency). We identified two groups of elements with contrasting relationship to discharge: (a) DIC and soluble elements (Cl, SO4, Li, B, Na, Mg, Ca, P, V, Cr, Mn, As, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba, W, and U) negatively correlated (p < 0.05) with discharge and exhibited minimal concentrations during spring flood and autumn high flow and (b) DOC and particle-reactive elements (Al, Fe, Ti, Y, Zr, Nb, Cs, REEs, Hf, Tl, Pb, and Th), some nutrients (K), and metalloids (Ge, Sb, and Te), positively correlated (p < 0.05) with discharge and showed the highest concentrations during spring flood. We attribute the decreased concentration of soluble elements with discharge to dilution by groundwater feeding and increased concentration of DOC and particle-reactive metals with discharge to leaching from surface soil, plant litter, and suspended particles. Overall, the present study provides first-order assessment of fluxes of major and trace elements in the middle course of the Ob River, reveals their high temporal and spatial stability, and characterizes the mechanism of river water chemical composition acquisition.

AB The magnitude and spatial heterogeneity of snow are difficult to model in mountainous terrain. We investigated how historic snow patterns from a 32-year (1985-2016) snow reanalysis, which uses the timing and rate of remotely-sensed snow disappearance to reconstruct snow water equivalent in past years, could be used to improve current year simulations of snowfall in the Upper Tuolumne, Upper Kings, and Sagehen Creek watersheds in California's Sierra Nevada. Building on past research linking observations of fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) to spatial patterns of snow water equivalent, fSCA maps were used to identify pairs of dates from historic years in the reanalysis with similar snow accumulation and depletion patterns. Historic snow accumulation patterns were then used to extrapolate snow accumulation observed by snow pillows to 90 m snowfall fields. These 90 m snowfall fields were used as input for snow simulations, the accuracy of which were evaluated versus airborne lidar snow depth observations. Except for water-year 2015, which had record low snow in the Sierra Nevada and unique snow patterns, normalized snow accumulation and depletion patterns identified from historic dates with spatially correlated fSCA agreed with each other well, with mean absolute differences of approximately 10%. Domain mean winter snowfall inferred from the relationship between historic snow accumulation patterns and current year snow pillow observations had a +/- 13% interquartile range of biases, relative to the snow reanalysis. Finally, snow depth simulations using snow pillow observed snowfall extrapolated with historic snow accumulation patterns had 70% better coefficients of correlations, and 27% better mean absolute errors, as compared to simulations using more common snowfall forcing. This work demonstrates the benefits of repeatable snowfall patterns and satellite-era snow reanalyses in mountainous regions with uncertain snowfall magnitude and spatial heterogeneity.

AB Changes in timing of snowmelt-fed streamflow have great importance for water supply, flood management, and ecological processes, as well as being a common indicator of climate change. In this study, snowmelt runoff timing change in the contiguous United States between 1957 and 2016 was investigated by analysing data from 97 streamflow gages. The annual snowmelt runoff timing shift was identified using 'Center Time (CT)' and 'Spring Pulse Onset (SPO)' methods, jointly with the monthly fractional streamflow (MFS) analysis, conducted between January and June. Since snowmelt-derived streamflow timing change is mainly induced by regional meteorological factors, such as air temperature and precipitation, their trends and relationship with CT were also examined. Shifts toward earlier snowmelt runoff timing were found by both methods, CT (8.3 days on average) and SPO (8.5 days on average). Although the results of the CT change are stronger than the SPO change, both outcomes are mostly correlated, particularly in the central and northwestern parts of the country. MFS trends support the outcomes of CT and SPO. In January, February, and especially March, a higher number of the stations indicated increasing trends in MFS. In April, May, and June, their number decreased and the number of gages with diminishing trends rose sharply. The timing difference is highly related to temperature change. Annual average temperature and temperature in the melting period increase considerably. The annual average temperature is significantly negatively correlated with CT in the vast majority of the regions. Although precipitation is not as effective as the temperature, its trends have impacts on snowmelt runoff timing change depending on the region and elevation. These results demonstrate the importance of the impacts of snowmelt runoff timing changes due to global warming on the regional and large-scale hydrology in the contiguous United States.

AB The advanced process-based model, National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE)-BGC, which incorporates the whole process of carbon cycling in land, was modified to include the feedback between soil organic content and overland carbon fluxes. It is a crucial and difficult task to evaluate the balance of the terrestrial carbon budget including the effect of inland water robustly. To accomplish this purpose, NICE-BGC was applied to quantify the global biogeochemical carbon cycle closely associated with the complex hydrological cycle during the 36 years between 1980 and 2015. The model demonstrated that the inter-annual variations of carbon cycle have been greatly affected by the extreme weather patterns. In particular, spatial distribution of temporal trends in riverine carbon fluxes and their relation to soil organic carbon (SOC) were analysed between different biomes and major river basins. Although there was a positive relationship between SOC and riverine flux of dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon in the northern boreal region, it is difficult to see this relation in other regions. Further, the evaluation of potential controlling factors of temporal trends in SOC and fluvial carbon exports was also helpful to quantify the inter-annual variation or temporal trend caused by the various effects. SOC was more influenced by temperature variations, whereas riverine carbon exports were mainly determined by precipitation variations. Finally, net land flux including inland water (-1.49 +/- 0.50 PgC/year) showed a slight decrease in the carbon sink in comparison with previous values (-2.33 +/- 0.50 PgC/year). These results help to distinguish the carbon cycle in different river basins and to re-evaluate carbon cycle change explicitly including the effect of inland water because this effect has been so far implicitly included within the range of uncertainty in the Earth's global carbon cycle comprising land, oceans, and atmosphere.

AB With global warming, hazards relating to glacial melt, such as glacial lake outburst floods, are becoming progressively more serious. However, glacial melt processes and their hydrological consequences are very poorly understood. This study collected glacier discharge data from the terminus of the Parlung No. 4 Glacier throughout the melt season (May-October) during 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012 to study its specific hydrological characteristics. Time series and multivariate regression analyses were employed to investigate the relationships between discharge and meteorological factors involved, as well as their correlation to discharge estimations. The 0- to 3-day time series analysis showed that discharge rates were highly autocorrelated and that discharge was significantly positively correlated to air temperature, vapour pressure and daily incoming shortwave radiation as well as weakly positively correlated to precipitation. A multiple-regression exponential model using the independent variables of the daily mean temperature and the vapour pressure exclusively was applied to simulate daily discharge in the basin with a high degree of accuracy. On average, July yielded the maximum monthly mean discharge, followed by August. Discharge in July and August accounted for 53% of the total discharge during the main melt season. The daily cycle of discharge changed as the melt season progressed, reflecting hydrological processes and characteristics of snow melt and glacier ice/snow melt, as well as their transitional periods. Subsequently, regular variations in the characteristics of the diurnal cycle of discharge, storage and delay were observed as the melt season progressed. In addition, the reasons behind the inter-annual variation in the characteristics of discharge and glacier discharge from the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas are compared and discussed.

AB The paper presents an analysis of 17 long annual maximum series (AMS) of flood flows for Swiss Alpine basins, aimed at checking the presence of changes in the frequency regime of annual maxima. We apply Pettitt's change point test, the nonparametric sign test and Sen's test on trends. We also apply a parametric goodness-of-fit test for assessing the suitability of distributions estimated on the basis of annual maxima collected up to a certain year for describing the frequency regime of later observations. For a number of series the tests yield consistent indications for significant changes in the frequency regime of annual maxima and increasing trends in the intensity of annual maximum discharges. In most cases, these changes cannot be explained by anthropogenic causes only (e.g. streamflow regulation, construction of dams). Instead, we observe a statistically significant relationship between the year of change and the elevation of the catchment outlet. This evidence is consistent with the findings of recent studies that explain increasing discharges in alpine catchments with an increase in the temperature controlling the portion of mountain catchments above the freezing point. Finally, we analyse the differences in return periods (RPs) estimated for a given flood flow on the basis of recent and past observations. For a large number of the study AMS, we observe that, on average, the 100-year flood for past observations corresponds to a RP of approximately 10 to 30years on the basis of more recent observation. From a complementary perspective, we also notice that estimated RP-year flood (i.e. flood quantile (FQ) associated with RP) increases on average by approximately 20% for the study area, irrespectively of the RP. Practical implications of the observed changes are illustrated and discussed in the paper. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We used frequency-domain reflectometry to make continuous, high-resolution measurements for 22 months of the soil moisture to a depth of 10 m in an Amazonian rain forest. We then used these data to determine how soil moisture varies on diel, seasonal and multi-year timescales, and to better understand the quantitative and mechanistic relationships between soil moisture and forest evapotranspiration. The mean annual precipitation at the site was over 1900 mm. The field capacity was approximately 0.53 m(3) m(-3) and was nearly uniform with soil depth. Soil moisture decreased at all levels during the dry season, with the minimum of 0.38 m(3) m(-3) at 3 m beneath the surface. The moisture in the upper I m showed a strong diel cycle with daytime depletion due to evapotranspiration. The moisture beneath 1 m declined during both day and night due to the combined effects of evapotranspiration, drainage and a nighttime upward movement of water. The depth of active water withdrawal changed markedly over the year. The upper 2 m of soil supplied similar to 56% of the water used for evapotranspiration in the wet season and similar to 28% of the water used in the dry season. The zone of active water withdrawal extended to a depth of at least 10 m. The day-to-day rates of moisture withdrawal from the upper 10 m of soil during rain-free periods agreed well with simultaneous measurements of whole-forest evapotranspiration made by the eddy covariance technique.

AB Alpine/subalpine basins may exhibit substantial variability in solute fluxes despite many apparent similarities in basin characteristics. An evaluation of controls on spatial patterns in solute fluxes may allow development of predictive tools for assessing basin sensitivity to outside perturbations such as climate change or deposition of atmospheric pollutants. Relationships between basin physical characteristics, determined from geographical information system (GIS) tools, and solute fluxes and mineral weathering rates were explored for nine alpine/subalpine basins in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, using correlation analyses for 1993 arid 1994 data. Stream-water nitrate fluxes were correlated positively with basin characteristics associated with the talus environment; i.e., the fractional amounts of steep slopes (greater than or equal to 30 degrees), unvegetated terrain and young debris (primarily Holocene till) in the basins, and were correlated negatively with fractional amounts of subalpine meadow terrain. Correlations with nitrate indicate the importance of the talus environment in promoting nitrate flux and the mitigating effect of areas with established vegetation, such as subalpine meadows. Total mineral weathering rates for the basins ranged from about 300 to 600 mot ha(-1) year Oligoclase weathering accounted for 30 to 73% of the total mineral weathering flux, and was positively correlated with the amount of old debris (primarily Pleistocene glacial till) in the basins. Although calcite is found in trace amounts in bedrock, calcite weathering accounted for tip to 44% of the total mineral weathering flux. Calcite was strongly correlated with steep slope, unvegetated terrain, and young debris-probably because physical weathering in steep-gradient areas exposes fresh mineral surfaces that contain calcite for chemical weathering. Oligoclase and calcite weathering are the dominant sources of alkalinity in the basins. However, atmospherically deposited acids consume much of the alkalinity generated by weathering of calcite and other minerals in the talus environment.

ID FRESH-WATER
AB Understanding the effectiveness of environmental flow deliveries along rivers requires monitoring vegetation. Monitoring data are often collected at multiple spatial scales. For riparian vegetation, optical remote sensing methods can estimate growth responses at the riparian corridor scale, and field-based measures can quantify species composition; however, the extent to which these different measures are duplicative or complementary is important to understand when planning monitoring programmes with limited resources. In this study, we analysed riparian vegetation growth in the delta of the Colorado River in response to an experimental pulse flow. Our goal was to compare ground-based measurements of vegetation structure and composition with satellite-based Landsat radiometric variables, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We made this comparison in 21 transects following the delivery of 131.8 million cubic meters (mcm) of water in the stream channel during the spring of 2014 as a pulse flow and 38.4 mcm as base flows. Vegetation cover increased 14% and NDVI increased 0.02 (15%) by October 2015, and both variables returned to pre-pulse flow values in October 2016. Observed changes in vegetation structure and composition did not persist after the second year. The highest increase in vegetation cover in October 2014 and October 2015 resulted from species that could respond rapidly to additional water such as reeds (Arundo donax and Phragmites australis), cattail (Typha domingensis), and herbaceous plants. Dominant shrubs, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and arrowweed (Pluchea sericea), both indicative of nonrestored habitats showed variable increases in cover, and native trees (Salicaceae family) presented low increases (1%). The strong NDVI-vegetation cover relationship indicates that NDVI is appropriate to detect changes at the riparian corridor scale but needs to be complemented with ground data to determine the contributions by different species to the observed trends.

AB Organic matter (OM) such as organic nitrogen plays a substantial role in the global biogeochemical cycling of bio-reactive components-amino acids (AA) in aquatic environments. Spatial and temporal variations in source, diagenesis, and fate of organic nitrogen such as AA in sediments of small tropical rivers and the role of oxbow/meandering loops under changing climatic conditions are poorly investigated. This study assessed the spatial and seasonal variations in OM composition, source, and diagenesis of a tropical small mountainous river-Netravati River, India, for 1 year. Water samples were determined for suspended particulate matter, and surface sediments were examined for bulk parameters, surface area (SA), and the L- and D-enantiomers of AA. The L- and D-enantiomers of AA displayed subtle seasonal variations in composition and depicted varying degrees of diagenesis. The concentration of D-enantiomer of AA was high and showed substantial contributions from bacteria, terrestrial source, and in situ production. The D-arginine was the most abundant D-enantiomer of AA in the study area, possibly due to extracellular secretion by bacterial species and adsorption onto sediments, and thus, it was protected from degradation. Degradation index was more negative at the oxbow and meandering loop stations during the dry season suggesting that local geomorphologic settings steer the diagenesis of OM within the river. A negative relationship between gamma-aminobutyric acid and organic carbon:surface area (OC:SA) ratio and a positive correlation between tyrosine and OC:SA ratio suggested accelerated loss of OM. Furthermore, the concentrations of most bulk parameters were higher in the lower reaches during monsoon and premonsoon seasons. Taken together, changes in seasons have an operational control in distinguishing the composition, source, and diagenesis of spatial OM distribution. Moreover, oxbows and river meandering loops influence the diagenetic processes in small tropical river systems.

AB There remains continued use of non-linear, logistic regression models for predicting water temperature from air temperature. A dominant feature of these non-linear models is an upper bound on river water temperature. This upper bound is often attributed to a large increase in evaporative cooling at high air temperatures, but the exact conditions under which such an increase may occur have not been thoroughly explored. To better understand the appropriateness of the non-linear model for predicting river water temperatures, it is essential to understand the physical basis for the upper bound and when it should and should not be included in the statistical model. This paper applies and validates an energy balance model against 8 river systems spread across different climate regions of the United States. The energy balance model is then used to develop a diagram relating vapour pressure deficit and air temperature to water temperature. With knowledge of present or future vapour pressure deficit (difference between saturation and actual vapour content in the atmosphere) conditions in a given climate, the diagram can be used to predict the likelihood of an upper bound in the air-water temperature relationship. This investigation offers a fundamental physical explanation of the most appropriate form of statistical models that should be used for predicting future water temperature from air temperature in different geographic regions with different climate conditions. In general, climatic regions that have only a slight increase in vapour pressure deficit with increasing air temperature (typically humid regions) would not be expected to have an upper bound. Conversely, climatic regions in which vapour pressure deficit sharply increases with increasing air temperature (typically arid regions) would be expected to have an upper bound.

AB Floods and debris flows in small Alpine torrent catchments (<10km(2)) arise from a combination of critical antecedent system state conditions and mostly convective precipitation events with high precipitation intensities. Thus, climate change may influence the magnitude-frequency relationship of extreme events twofold: by a modification of the occurrence probabilities of critical hydrological system conditions and by a change of event precipitation characteristics. Three small Alpine catchments in different altitudes in Western Austria (Ruggbach, Brixenbach and Langentalbach catchment) were investigated by both field experiments and process-based simulation. Rainfall-runoff model (HQsim) runs driven by localized climate scenarios (CNRM-RM4.5/ARPEGE, MPI-REMO/ECHAM5 and ICTP-RegCM3/ECHAM5) were used in order to estimate future frequencies of stormflow triggering system state conditions. According to the differing altitudes of the study catchments, two effects of climate change on the hydrological systems can be observed. On one hand, the seasonal system state conditions of medium altitude catchments are most strongly affected by air temperature-controlled processes such as the development of the winter snow cover as well as evapotranspiration. On the other hand, the unglaciated high-altitude catchment is less sensitive to climate change-induced shifts regarding days with critical antecedent soil moisture and desiccated litter layer due to its elevation-related small proportion of sensitive areas. For the period 2071-2100, the number of days with critical antecedent soil moisture content will be significantly reduced to about 60% or even less in summer in all catchments. In contrast, the number of days with dried-out litter layers causing hydrophobic effects will increase by up to 8%-11% of the days in the two lower altitude catchments. The intensity analyses of heavy precipitation events indicate a clear increase in rain intensities of up to 10%.

AB Landslides are natural processes triggered by complex relationships between many conditioning factors. In Rio de Janeiro city, intense rainstorms combined with steep slopes, usually occupied by slums, create favourable conditions for landslide generation. In general, slope failures are related to high positive pore-pressures inside soil mantles, which are associated with topographic hollows and hydraulic discontinuities inside the deep weathered profile.
   This study aims to characterize the role played by spatial variations in saturated soil hydraulic conductivity K-sat on landsliding in the Papagaio Basin (2-5 km(2)), triggered by intense rainstorms (250 mm in less than 2 days) in February 1996. Field measurements, using the Guelph permeameter, were conducted along soil profiles (up to 5.0 m depth), around and inside landslide scars representing different geomorphological domains. Also, soil physical properties (grain size, total porosity, macroporosity, microporosity, etc.) were evaluated at the 87 sites where K-sat was measured.
   Despite the many geological and pedological variations inside the basin, including changes in lithology, fracture density, vegetation type and succession stage, soil characteristics and weathering stage, and human activities, 94% of the K-sat values varied by only two orders of magnitude (1.0 x 10(-6)-9.0 x 10(-5) m s(-1)). However, abrupt changes in K-sat were observed along some of the soil profiles studied, e.g. an increase of two orders of magnitude in only 0.30 m. These hydraulic discontinuities may contribute locally to the development of high pore pressures during intense rainstorms. leading to landsliding. The results also suggest that different K-sat variation patterns coexist inside the basin. which should be considered in mathematical models of landslide prediction.

AB We apply a reactive transport lattice Boltzmann model developed in previous studies to study the dissolution-induced changes in permeability and porosity of two porous media at the pore scale. The permeability-porosity relationship is explored for a wide range of Peclet and Damkohler numbers. It is found that this relationship depends not only on different dissolution regimes characterized by Pe and Da, but also on the specific porous medium structure. The permeability-porosity relationship for the more geometrically complex porous medium shows much more complexity than that for the simple fractured medium. While a very small Da sets an upper bound for the permeability-porosity relationship for the simple medium, a combination of a high Da and Pe results in wormholing, and the fastest permeability increase for the complex medium. At a moderate Pe but large Da, a transition from transport-limited dissolution regime to wormholing is also observed for the complex medium. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater flow direction within the critical zone of headwater catchments is often assumed to mimic land surface topographic gradients. However, groundwater hydraulic gradients are also influenced by subsurface permeability contrasts, which can result in variability in flow direction and magnitude. In this study, we investigated the relationship between shallow groundwater flow direction, surface topography, and the subsurface topography of low permeability units in a headwater catchment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH. We continuously monitored shallow groundwater levels in the solum throughout several seasons in a well network (20 wells of 0.18-1.1 m depth) within the upper hillslopes of Watershed 3 of the HBEF. Water levels were also monitored in four deeper wells, screened from 2.4 to 6.9 m depth within glacial drift of the C horizon. We conducted slug tests across the well network to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of the materials surrounding each well. Results showed that under higher water table regimes, groundwater flow direction mimics surface topography, but under lower water table regimes, flow direction can deviate as much as 56 degrees from surface topography. Under these lower water table conditions, groundwater flow direction instead followed the topography of the top of the C horizon. The interquartile range of K-sat within the C horizon was two orders of magnitude lower than within the solum. Overall, our results suggest that the land surface topography and the top of the C horizon acted as end members defining the upper and lower bounds of flow direction variability. This suggests that temporal dynamics of groundwater flow direction should be considered when calculating hydrologic fluxes in critical zone and runoff generation studies of headwater catchments that are underlain by glacial drift.

TI Underdamped slug tests with unsaturated-saturated flows by considering
   effects of wellbore skins

AB An analytical solution is presented for the slug tests conducted in a partially penetrating well in an unconfined aquifer affected from above by an unsaturated zone. The solution considers the effects of wellbore skin and oscillatory responses on underdamped slug tests. The flow in the saturated zone is described by a two-dimensional, axially symmetric governing equation, and the flow in the unsaturated zone above the water table by a linearized one-dimensional Richards' equation. The unsaturated medium properties are represented by the exponential constitutive relationships. A Laplace domain solution is derived using the Laplace and finite Fourier transform and the solution in the real-time domain is evaluated using the numerical inverse Laplace transform method. The solution derived in this study is more general and reduces to the most commonly used solutions for slug tests in their specified conditions. It is found that the unsaturated flow has a significant impact on the slug test conducted in an unconfined aquifer. The impact of unsaturated flow on such a slug test is enhanced with a larger anisotropy ratio, a shorter well screen length, a shorter distance between the well screen and the water table, or a larger well screen radius. The impact of unsaturated flow on slug tests decreases as the degree of penetration (the length of well screen) increases. For a fixed well screen length, the impact of unsaturated flow on slug tests decreases as the distance between the centre of screen and the water table increases. A large dimensionless well screen radius (>0.01) leads to significant effects of unsaturated flow on slug tests. The unsaturated flow reduces the oscillatory responses to underdamped slug tests. The unsaturated zone has significant impact on slug test under high-permeability wellbore skin.

AB This article proposes an improved multi-run genetic programming (GP) and applies it to estimate the typhoon rainfall over ocean using multi-variable meteorological satellite data. GP is a well-known evolutionary programming and data mining method used to automatically discover the complex relationships among nonlinear systems. The main advantage of GP is to optimize appropriate types of function and their associated coefficients simultaneously. However, the searching efficiency of traditional GP can be decreased by the complex structure of parse tree to represent the multiple input variables. This study processed an improvement to enhance escape ability from local optimums during the optimization procedure. We continuously run GP several times by replacing the terminal nodes at the next run with the best solution at the current run. The current method improves GP, obtaining a highly nonlinear meaningful equation to estimate the rainfall. In the case study, this improved GP (IGP) described above combined with special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) seven channels was employed. These results are then verified with the data from four offshore rainfall stations located on islands around Taiwan. The results show that the IGP generates sophisticated and accurate multi-variable equation through two runs. The performance of IGP outperforms the traditional multiple linear regression, back-propagated network (BPN) and three empirical equations. Because the extremely high values of precipitation rate are quite few and the number of zero values (no rain) is very large, the underestimations of heavy rainfall are obvious. A simple genetic algorithm was therefore used to search for the optimal threshold value of SSM/I channels, detecting the data of no rain. The IGP with two runs, used to construct an appropriate mathematical function to estimate the precipitation, can obtain more favourable results from estimating extremely high values. Copyright.

AB The occurrence of flowing wells in basins has been found to be closely related to the discharge area with an upward hydraulic gradient. Unfortunately, previous studies on upward gradient induced wellbore flow with equaling total inflow (Q(in)) in the deep and total outflow (Q(out)) in the shallow could not explain the occurrence of flowing wells. By representing wells using the MNW2 Package imbedded in MODFLOW 2005, we obtain the exchange of groundwater between the aquifer and the well in the discharge area of 3D unit basins and identify three scenarios: Q(in)=Q(out), Q(in)>Q(out)>0 and Q(in)>Q(out)=0. The relationship of Q(in)>Q(out) well explains why flowing wells only develop in a limited part of the discharge area. Sensitivity analysis shows that well location, water table undulation, and basin length-depth ratio do not change the profile of the ratio of cumulative flow rate in a flowing well to total inflow (Q(v)/Q(in)) versus the relative elevation in the inflow segment, z(in)*, but could significantly change the length of the inflow segment; well depth could change both the length of the inflow segment and the profile of Q(v)/Q(in) versus z(in)*. Based on the numerical results in homogeneous and isotropic basins with different basin length-depth ratios in the current study, the ratio of inflow in the lower half part of a flowing well to the total inflow is found to be at least 67% and could be close to 100%, indicating that water at the outlets of flowing wells with long open sections is mainly from the deep part of the well.

AB Spatiotemporal characteristics of drought based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) in the Liao River basin (LRB) are investigated in this study. High autocorrelation in SPI seems to lend itself to drought prediction. Drought is becoming more frequent, widespread, and severe in the LRB during the past several decades. Major factors affecting drought in this basin are analysed by investigating relationship between SPI and several circulations including western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices. Different correlation patterns between WPSH indices and SPI are obtained. Several significant positive correlations between the area, intensity of WPSH and SPI are observed in the west and the centre of the study area, while negative correlations are observed in the east. Reverse patterns are observed in the correlation between the ridge of westward longitude of WPSH and SPI. Corresponding lag-correlation is dominated by positive correlations between the area, intensity of WPSH and SPI, and by negative correlation between the ridge of westward longitude of WPSH and SPI. EASM is mainly negative related with drought in the east of the LRB. Significant positive correlation between ENSO and SPI is mainly located in the east while negative correlation is located in west of the basin. Lag-correlation (with lags of 1 to 12 months) between them is also investigated and results show that significant negative correlation is located in a broad area extending from the west to the centre of the basin, while less positive correlation is observed with the increase of lags. The possibility of employing general circulation models (GCMs) for drought prediction is discussed based on the above analyses. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB There is some evidence of rapid changes in the global atmosphere and hydrological cycle caused by the influence of climate variability. In West Africa, such changes impact directly on water resources leading to incessant extreme hydro-meteorological conditions. This study examines the association of three global climate teleconnections-El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) with changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) derived from both Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA, 1980-2015) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE, 2002-2014). In the Sahel region, positive phase of AMO coincided with above-normal rainfall (wet conditions) and the negative phase with drought conditions and confirms the observed statistically significant association (r = 0.62) between AMO and the temporal evolutions of standardised precipitation index. This relationship corroborates the observed presence of AMO-driven TWS in much of the Sahel region (though considerably weak in some areas). Although ENSO appears to be more associated with GRACE-derived TWS over the Volta basin (r = -0.40), this study also shows a strong presence of AMO- and ENSO-induced TWS derived from MERRA reanalysis data in the coastal West African countries and most of the regions below latitude 10 degrees N. The observed presence of ENSO- and AMO-driven TWS is noticeable in tropical areas with relatively high annual/bimodal rainfall and strong inter-annual variations in surface water. The AMO has a wider footprint and sphere of influence on the region's TWS and suggests the important role of North Atlantic Ocean. IOD-related TWS also exists in West Africa and its influence on the region's hydrology maybe secondary and somewhat complementary. Nonetheless, presumptive evidence from the study indicates that ENSO and AMO are the two major climatic indices more likely to impact on West Africa's TWS.

AB Evapotranspiration is difficult to quantify because of the many factors and complex processes that influence it. Several empirical methods have been developed over the years to estimate potential evapotranspiration based on easily available parameters. Directly measured data of actual evapotranspiration have been rather sparse in the past and still need to be improved in particular regions like western Siberia. The transition zone between the warm temperate and cold temperate continental climates is very sensitive to climate change, and water stress is an increasingly important issue in these regions with a highly dynamic agricultural activity. So there is a growing need to estimate actual evapotranspiration. Widely usable approximations are needed. In this study, the values of potential evapotranspiration computed with the original version, and eight modifications of the Penman formulation were compared and related to the actual evapotranspiration measured by eddy covariance over a grassland area in western Siberia. The original 1948 and 1963 Penman formulations are best for estimating potential evapotranspiration in the transition zone between the forest steppes and the pre-taiga. A nearly linear relationship between the potential and actual evapotranspiration was found. A simple modification of the Penman equation (i.e. the multiplication of the result by a factor of 0.47) is suggested for approximating the actual evapotranspiration based on standard meteorological data for the region. The original Penman formulation is most robust and will provide the widest applicability in the future under changing climate and environmental conditions. In this context, it is further recommended not to neglect the ventilation term of the Penman equation, which is often assumed to be negligibly small. A detailed correlation analysis showed that under dry soil conditions, the vegetation largely contributed to the actual evapotranspiration and, in contrast to widely held expectations, that the Penman equation is best adapted to vegetated surfaces.

AB The aim of this paper is to assess the relative importance of low flow indicators for the River Rhine and to identify their appropriate temporal lag and resolution. This is done in the context of low flow forecasting with lead times of 14 and 90 days. First, the Rhine basin is subdivided into seven sub-basins. By considering the dominant processes in the sub-basins, five low flow indicators were selected: precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, groundwater storage, snow storage and lake storage. Correlation analysis was then carried out to determine the relationship between observed low flows and preselected indicators with varying lags (days) and temporal resolutions (from 1 day to 7 months). The results show that the most important low flow indicators in the Alpine sub-basins for forecasts with a lead time of 14 days are potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution, and lake levels with a small lag and temporal resolution. In the other sub-basins groundwater levels with a small lag and temporal resolution are important in addition to potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution. The picture is slightly different for forecasts with a lead time of 90 days. The snow storage in the Alpine sub-basins and the precipitation in the other sub-basins also become relevant for low flows. Consequently, the most important low flow indicators in the Alpine sub-basins for forecasts with a lead time of 90 days are potential evapotranspiration with a large lag and temporal resolution, lake levels with a small lag and temporal resolution and snow storage with a small lag and large temporal resolution. The resultant correlation maps provide appropriate lags and temporal resolutions for indicators to forecast low flows in the River Rhine with different lead times.

AB The measurement of discharge is fundamental in nutrient load estimation. Because of our ability to monitor discharge routinely, it is generally assumed that the associated uncertainty is low. This paper challenges this preconception, arguing that discharge uncertainty should be explicitly taken into account to produce robust statistical analyses. In many studies, paired discharge and chemical datasets are used to calculate true' loads and used as the benchmark to compare with other load estimates. This paper uses two years of high frequency (daily and sub-hourly) discharge and nutrient concentration data (nitrate-N and total phosphorus (TP)) collected at four field sites as part of the Hampshire Avon Demonstration Test Catchment (DTC) programme. A framework for estimating observational nutrient load uncertainty was used which combined a flexible non-parametric approach to characterising discharge uncertainty, with error modelling that allowed the incorporation of errors which were heteroscedastic and temporally correlated. The results showed that the stage-discharge relationships were non-stationary, and observational uncertainties from +/- 2 to 25% were recorded when the velocity-area method was used. The variability in nutrient load estimates ranged from 1.1 to 9.9% for nitrate-N and from 3.3 to 10% for TP when daily laboratory data were used, rising to a maximum of 9% for nitrate-N and 83% for TP when the sensor data were used. However, the sensor data provided a better representation of the true' load as storm events are better represented temporally, posing the question: is it more beneficial to have high frequency, lower precision data or lower frequency but higher precision data streams to estimate nutrient flux responses in headwater catchments?

AB The aim of this study was to investigate rainfall-groundwater dynamics over space and annual time scales in a hard-rock aquifer system of India by employing time series, geographic information system and geostatistical modelling techniques. Trends in 43-year (1965-2007) annual rainfall time series of ten rainfall stations and 16-year (1991-2006) pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels of 140 sites were identified by using Mann-Kendall, Spearman rank order correlation and Kendall rank correlation tests. Trends were quantified by Kendall slope method. Furthermore, the study involves novelty of examining homogeneity of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels, for the first time, by applying seven tests. Regression analysis between rainfall and post-monsoon groundwater levels was performed. The pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels for four periods - 1991-1994, 1995-1998, 1999-2002 and 2003-2006 - were subjected to geographic information system-based geostatistical modelling. The rainfall showed considerable spatiotemporal variations, with a declining trend at the Mavli rainfall station (p-value<0.05). The Levene's tests revealed spatial homogeneity of rainfall at =0.05. Regression analyses indicated significant relationships (r(2)>0.5) between groundwater level and rainfall for eight rainfall stations. Non-homogeneity and declining trends in the groundwater level, attributed to anthropogenic and hydrologic factors, were found at 5-61 more sites in pre-monsoon compared with post-monsoon season. The groundwater declining rates in phyllite-schist, gneiss, schist and granite formations were found to be 0.18, 0.26, 0.21 and 0.14myear(-1) and 0.13, 0.19, 0.16 and 0.02myear(-1) during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. The geostatistical analyses for four time periods revealed linkages between the rainfall and groundwater levels. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Winter conditions play an important role for the largest lake in Europe-Lake Ladoga. The ice cover lasts for 171 +/- 3 days on average from the early November until the mid-May. We investigated the ice regime of Lake Ladoga using a constructed ice database of aircraft surveys and satellite images. More than 1250 surveys of the lake's ice cover from 1943 to 2010 were collected and analysed to determine mean and extreme ice conditions for winters of different types of severity. The time series of ice cover percentage over the lake was plotted. On average, 18 observational ice charts were made every winter. Individual ice phenology records show considerable year-to-year variation. For this reason, records typically have been combined and analysed as groups (categories). Extremely cold winters were determined as winters with complete ice cover that lasts more than three months which is approximately 90% quartiles from all winters with complete ice cover. The lake surface was completely covered with ice for more than three months during 5 seasons. Extremely warm winters when the maximum ice cover was less than 70% of the lake area occurred during 5 seasons as well. A basic relationship between the winter severity as winter maximum of accumulated freezing degree-days (AFDD) and the earlier derived Relative Ice Cover Index (RICI) was established. We have used teleconnection indices such as North Atlantic Oscillations (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) for the period from October to May for estimation of different types of Lake Ladoga's ice conditions. The AO index in winter months and local winter maximum of AFDD explained much of the interannual variation in ice cover. Copyright. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Transpiration coefficient K-cb, crop coefficient K-c, and the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration (T/ET) are important parameters for pear orchard irrigation management and may vary with different methods of irrigation. This study investigated their changes under three irrigation methods: conventional flood irrigation (CFI), fixed partial rootzone drying and irrigation (FPRD) and alternative partial root-zone drying and irrigation (APRD), in a semi-arid region of Victoria, Australia. The average seasonal ET was 865(.)29, 795(.)63 and 804(.)72 mm respectively for CFI, FPRD, and APRD with ET0 of 817(.)59 mm for the pear fruiting season. The seasonal transpiration accounted for 81(.)1%, 84(.)4%, and 84(.)1% of evapotranspiration for CFI, FPRD, and APRD respectively. For the CFI, FPRD, and APRD treatments, the seasonal average K-c were 1(.)058, 0(.)973, and 0(.)984 (with their maximum values of 1(.)326, 1(.)211, and 1(.)57) respectively similarly, the respective seasonal average K-cb were 0(.)858, 0(.)822, and 0(.)828 (with maximum values of 1(.)059, 1(.)024, and 1(.)054). The relationships between K-cb, K-c, T/ET, and days after the season beginning were fitted to a fifth-order polynomial equation with higher coefficients of determination R-2. The maximum K-c and K-cb occurred in mid-January. The ratio T/ET varied from 0(.)736 to 0(.)909, 0(.)743 to 0(.)947, and 0(.)741 to 0(.)925 in the pear fruiting season for CFI, FPRD, and APRD treatments respectively. Results suggested that APRD and FPRD can improve the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration, and reduce transpiration coefficient and crop coefficient. Such effects should help improve of water-use efficiency in pear orchards. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Extreme hydrologic responses following wildfires can lead to floods and debris flows with costly economic and societal impacts. Process-based hydrologic and geomorphic models used to predict the downstream impacts of wildfire must account for temporal changes in hydrologic parameters related to the generation and subsequent routing of infiltration-excess overland flow across the landscape. However, we lack quantitative relationships showing how parameters change with time-since-burning, particularly at the watershed scale. To assess variations in best-fit hydrologic parameters with time, we used the KINEROS2 hydrological model to explore temporal changes in hillslope saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sh) and channel hydraulic roughness (n(c)) following a wildfire in the upper Arroyo Seco watershed (41.5 km(2)), which burned during the 2009 Station fire in the San Gabriel Mountains, California, USA. This study explored runoff-producing storms between 2008 and 2014 to infer watershed hydraulic properties by calibrating the model to observations at the watershed outlet. Modelling indicates K-sh is lowest in the first year following the fire and then increases at an average rate of approximately 4.2 mm/h/year during the first 5 years of recovery. The estimated values for K-sh in the first year following the fire are similar to those obtained in previous studies on smaller watersheds (<1.5 km(2)) following the Station fire, suggesting hydrologic changes detected here can be applied to lower-order watersheds. Hydraulic roughness, n(c), was lowest in the first year following the fire, but increased by a factor of 2 after 1 year of recovery. Post-fire observations suggest changes in n(c) are due to changes in grain roughness and vegetation in channels. These results provide quantitative constraints on the magnitude of fire-induced hydrologic changes following severe wildfires in chaparral-dominated ecosystems as well as the timing of hydrologic recovery.

AB This study aims to evaluate the application of Rn-222 in groundwater as a tracer for monitoring CO2 plume migration in a shallow groundwater system, which is important to detect potential CO2 leakage in the carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. For this research, an artificial CO2-infused water injection experiment was performed in a shallow aquifer by monitoring hydrogeochemical parameters, including Rn-222. Radon in groundwater can be a useful tracer because of its sensitivity to sudden changes in subsurface environment. To monitor the CO2 plume migration, the data were analysed based on (a) the influence of mixing processes on the distribution of Rn-222 induced by the artificial injection experiment and (b) the influence of a carrier gas role by CO2 on the variation of Rn-222. The spatio-temporal distributions of radon concentrations were successfully explained in association with horizontal and vertical mixing processes by the CO2-infused water injection. Additionally, the mixing ratios of each monitoring well were calculated, quantitatively confirming the influence of these mixing processes on the distribution of radon concentrations. Moreover, one monitoring well showed a high positive relationship between Rn-222 and Total dissolved inorganic carbon (TIC) by the carrier gas effect of CO2 through volatilization from the CO2 plume. It indicated the applicability of Rn-222 as a sensitive tracer to directly monitor CO2 leakage. When with a little effect of carrier gas, natural Rn-222 in groundwater can be used to compute mixing ratio of CO2-infused water indicative of CO2 migration pathways. CO2 carrier gas effect can possibly increase Rn-222 concentration in groundwater and, if fully verified with more field tests, will pose a great potential to be used as a natural tracer for CO2.

AB Soil water repellency induced by wildfires can alter hydraulic properties and hydrologic processes; however, the persistence and vertical position (i.e., depth) of water-repellent layers can vary between systems and fires, with limited understanding of how those variations affect infiltration processes. This study occurred in two forested locations in the south-central Appalachian Mountains that experienced wildfires in late 2016: Mount Pleasant Wildfire Refuge, Virginia, and Chimney Rock State Park, North Carolina. In each location, sites were selected to represent unburned conditions and low to moderate burn intensities. At each site, we measured the soil water repellency at the surface (ash layer or O horizon) and ~2 cm below the surface (A horizon) using the water drop penetration time method (n = 10-14). Soil water content was also measured over the upper 10 cm of the soil (n = 10), and infiltration tests were conducted using a tension infiltrometer (n = 6-8). The results showed that soil repellency was highest in the surface layer at the Mount Pleasant location and was highest in the subsurface layer at the Chimney Rock location. Soil water content was lower in unburned soil than in burned soil, especially for measurements taken immediately postfire, with soil water content negatively correlated with water repellency. Water repellency in the surface layer significantly reduced relative infiltration rates (estimated as differences between initial and steady-state rates), whereas subsurface water repellency did not affect relative infiltration. As a result, water repellency persisted longer in sites with surface as opposed to subsurface water repellency. Finally, differences between burned and unburned sites showed that although the wildfires increased the occurrence of water repellency, they did not alter the underlying relationship between relative infiltration and water repellency of the surface soil.

ID MACKENZIE RIVER
AB Reliable and prompt information on river ice condition and extent is needed to make accurate hydrological forecasts to predict ice jams breakups and issue timely flood warnings. This study presents a technique to detect and monitor river ice using observations from the MODIS instrument onboard the Terra satellite. The technique incorporates a threshold-based decision tree image classification algorithm to process MODIS data and to determine the extent of ice. To differentiate between ice-covered and ice-free pixels within the riverbed, the algorithm combines observations in the visible and near-infrared spectral bands. The developed technique presents the core of the MODIS-based river ice mapping system, which has been developed to support National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NWS's operations. The system has been tested over the Susquehanna River in northeastern USA, where ice jam events leading to spring floods are a frequent occurrence. The automated algorithm generates three products: daily ice maps, weekly composite ice maps and running cloud-free composite ice maps. The performance of the system was evaluated over nine winter seasons. The analysis of the derived products has revealed their good agreement with the aerial photography and with in situ observations-based ice charts. The probability of ice detection determined from the comparison of the product with the high-resolution Landsat imagery was equal to 91%. A consistent inverse relationship was found between the river discharge and the ice extent. The correlation between the discharge and the ice extent as determined from the weekly composite product reached 0.75. The developed CREST River Ice Observation System has been implemented at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Cooperative Remote Sensing Science and Technology Center as an operational Web tool allowing end users and forecasters to assess ice conditions on the river.

AB Watershed scale hydrological and biogeochemical models rely on the correct spatial-temporal prediction of processes governing water and contaminant movement. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, one of the most commonly used watershed scale models, uses the popular curve number (CN) method to determine the respective amounts of infiltration and surface runoff. Although appropriate for flood forecasting in temperate climates, the CN method has been shown to be less than ideal in many situations (e. g. monsoonal climates and areas dominated by variable source area hydrology). The CN model is based on the assumption that there is a unique relationship between the average moisture content and the CN for all hydrologic response units (HRUs), and that the moisture content distribution is similar for each runoff event, which is not the case in many regions. Presented here is a physically based water balance that was coded in the SWAT model to replace the CN method of runoff generation. To compare this new water balance SWAT (SWAT-WB) to the original CN-based SWAT (SWAT-CN), two watersheds were initialized; one in the headwaters of the Blue Nile in Ethiopia and one in the Catskill Mountains of New York. In the Ethiopian watershed, streamflow predictions were better using SWAT-WB than SWAT-CN [Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) of 0.79 and 0.67, respectively]. In the temperate Catskills, SWAT-WB and SWAT-CN predictions were approximately equivalent (NSE >0.70). The spatial distribution of runoff-generating areas differed greatly between the two models, with SWAT-WB reflecting the topographical controls imposed on the model. Results show that a water balance provides results equal to or better than the CN, but with a more physically based approach. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Huai River Basin, as the sixth largest river basin in China, has a high-regulated river system and has been facing severe water problems. In this article, the changing patterns of runoff and precipitation at 10 hydrological stations from 1956 to 2000 on the highly regulated river (Shaying River) and less-regulated river (Huai River) in the basin are evaluated at the monthly, seasonal and annual scales using the Mann-Kendall test and simple linear regression model. The results showed that: (1) No statistically significant trends of precipitation in the upper and middle Huai River Basins were detected at the annual scale, but the trend of annual runoff at Baiguishan, Zhoukou and Fuyang stations in Shaying River decreased significantly, whereas the others were not. Moreover, the decreasing trends of runoff for most months were significant in Shaying River, although the trend of monthly precipitation decreased significantly only in April in the whole research area and the number of months in the dry season having significantly decreasing trends in runoff was more than that in the wet season. (2) The rainfall-runoff relationship was significant in both highly regulated river and less-regulated river. In regulated river, the reservoirs have larger regulation capacity than the floodgates and thus have the smaller correlation coefficient and t-value. In Huai River, the correlation coefficients decreased from upper stream to downstream. (3) The regulation of dams and floodgates for flood control and water supply was the principal reason for the decreasing runoff in Huai River Basin, although the decreasing precipitation in April in this basin was statistically significant. The findings are useful for recognizing hydrology variation and will provide scientific foundation to integrated water resources management in Huai River Basin.

TI PARADOXES AND REALITIES IN UNSATURATED FLOW THEORY
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In currently applied theory of unsaturated flow, paradoxes exist concerning the equation of state for the water phase, the idea of a water phase at negative absolute pressure, the applicability of the hydrostatic pressure gradient at equilibrium, and the lack of explicit inclusion of interface effects in the problem formulation.  The theory of unsaturated flow presented here eliminates those paradoxes and indicates that the hysteresis in capillary pressure and relative permeability may be accounted for by allowing these quantities to depend on interfacial area as well as saturation.  The wettability potential is shown to be a thermodynamic function which is important in describing unsaturated flow processes.  The momentum balance equation for the interface between the air and water phases also contributes to a systematic and tractable set of equations which describe unsaturated flow.

AB Daily swath MODIS Terra Collection 6 fractional snow cover (MOD10_L2) estimates were validated with two-day Landsat TM/ETM+snow-covered area estimates across central Idaho and southwestern Montana, USA. Snow cover maps during spring snowmelt for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 were compared between MODIS Terra and Landsat TM/ETM+using least-squared regression. Strong spatial and temporal map agreement was found between MODIS Terra fractional snow cover and Landsat TM/ETM+snow-covered area, although map disagreement was observed for two validation dates. High-altitude cirrus cloud contamination during low snow conditions as well as late season transient snowfall resulted in map disagreement. MODIS Terra's spatial resolution limits retrieval of thin-patchy snow cover, especially during partially cloudy conditions. Landsat's image acquisition frequency can introduce difficulty when discriminating between transient and resident mountain snow cover. Furthermore, transient snowfall later in the snowmelt season, which is a stochastic accumulation event that does not usually persist beyond the daily timescale, will skew decadal snow-covered area variability if bi-monthly climate data record development is the objective. As a quality control step, ground-based daily snow telemetry snow-water-equivalent measurements can be used to verify transient snowfall events. Users of daily MODIS Terra fractional snow products should be aware that local solar illumination and sensor viewing geometry might influence fractional snow cover estimation in mountainous terrain. Cross-sensor interoperability has been confirmed between MODIS Terra and Landsat TM/ETM+when mapping snow from the visible/infrared spectrum. This relationship is strong and supports operational multi-sensor snow cover mapping, specifically climate data record development to expand cryosphere, climate, and hydrological science applications.

AB Stream temperature was monitored at five mainstem locations and one tributary location on the Girnock Burn, a 31-km(2) tributary catchment of the Aberdeenshire Dee in north-east Scotland. Stream temperature was recorded at 15-min resolution between April 2003 and March 2006 to investigate the influence of semi-natural riparian woodland on the spatial and temporal variability of stream temperature and the influence that this had on the performance of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Two upstream sites were located in open moorland locations, while three downstream sites were located in areas of mixed deciduous/coniferous woodland areas at progressive distances of 0.75, 1.5 and 2.0 kin from the upstream edge of continuous riparian tree cover. The effects of riparian woodland on stream temperature varied through the year, increasing during the spring to a maximum in summer, before decreasing once again in autumn. Maximum, mean and diel temperature amplitude were lower and minimum temperatures higher at woodland sites when compared to those located in open moorland. Although significant differences in fish performance were detected between sites, the influence of temperature variability was unclear due to confounding factors, some of which could not be measured during the study. It is recommended that future studies should combine advances in field-based temperature monitoring with those in hydroclimatology to develop realistic process-based models that can be used for stream temperature prediction. Further advances are needed in understanding the relationship between naturally variable thermal regime and fish performance in order that ecological predictions can be usefully made from field and modelled temperature data.

AB The Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) provides the theoretical basis for many "atmospheric-based" methods (such as eddy covariance and flux-profile methods) that are widely used for quantifying surface-atmosphere exchange processes. The turbulence driven and highly nonlinear profiles of momentum, air temperature, and vapor densities require complex resistance expressions applied to simple gradients deduced from a single or few height measurements. Notwithstanding the success of these atmospheric-based methods, they often leave a gap at the immediate vicinity of terrestrial surfaces where fluxes emanate. A complementary approach for quantifying surface fluxes relies on diffusive interactions across a viscous sublayer next to the surface, referred to as the "surface boundary layer (BL)" approach. This study (for bare soil) establishes formal links between these two approaches thereby offering a physically based lower boundary condition (BC) for flux-profile methods while improving the top BC for surface BL-based formulations to include atmospheric stability. The modified lower BC for flux-profile relationships links characteristics of drying evaporating surfaces considering nonlinearities between wetness and evaporative fluxes and obviates reliance on both profile measurements and empirical surface resistances. The revised top BC for surface BL methods greatly improves the agreement with published field-scale experimental measurements. The proposed reconciliation procedure improves estimation capabilities of both flux-profile and surface BL formulations, and considerably enhances their accuracy of flux estimation when applied theoretically (in the absence of measured profiles) to drying bare soil surfaces.

AB It is known that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon induces marked climate variability across many parts of the world. However, in seeking useful relationships between ENSO and climate, several indices are available. In addition to the choice of index, previous studies assessing ENSO effects have employed a range of different methods to classify periods as El Nino, La Nina or Neutral. It is therefore clear that significant subjectivity exists in the adoption of ENSO classification schemes. In this study, several ENSO classification methods are applied to a range of ENSO indices. Each method-index combination is investigated to determine which provides the strongest relationship with rainfall: and runoff in the Williams River catchment, New South Wales, Australia. The results demonstrate substantial differences between the methods and indices. The Multivariate ENSO Index (or MEI) is found to provide the best classification irrespective of method. The potential for forecasting ENSO-related effects on rainfall, runoff and river abstractions is then investigated. A "rise rule" to account for dynamic ENSO trends is also assessed. Strong relationships were found to exist with runoff (rainfall) up to nine (eight) months in advance of the Summer/autumn period. Implications for improved forecasting of potential river abstractions are apparent.

AB Periodic submersion and exposure due to the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) alter the soil properties and plant characteristics at different elevations within the water level fluctuation zone (WLFZ), possibly influencing the soil detachment capacity (D-c), but the vertical heterogeneity of this effect is uncertain. Soil samples were taken from 6 elevation segments (5 m per segment) along a slope profile in the WLFZ of the TGR to clarify the vertical heterogeneity of D-c. Scouring experiments were conducted at 5 slope gradients (17.6%, 26.8%, 36.4%, 46.6%, and 57.7%) and 5 flow rates (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 L min(-1)) to determine D-c. The results indicate that the soil properties and biomass parameters of the WLFZ exhibit strongly vertical heterogeneity. D-c fluctuates with increasing elevation, with maximum and minimum average values at elevations of 145-150 m and 165-170 m, respectively. Linear equations accurately describe the relationships between D-c and hydrodynamic parameters, for which the shear stress (tau), stream power (omega), and unit energy of water-carrying section (E) perform much better than the unit stream power (U). Furthermore, a clear improvement is achieved when using a general index of flow intensity to estimate D-c. Furthermore, D-c is significantly and negatively correlated with the mean weight diameter (MWD, p < 0.05) and organic matter content (p < 0.01) but not significantly correlated with other soil properties (p > 0.05). The rill erodibility at elevations of 145-150 m and 170-175 m is greater than that at other elevations. The critical hydraulic parameters were highest in the 165-170 m segments. Both the rill erodibility and the critical parameters fluctuate vertically along the sloping surface. This research highlights the vertical heterogeneity of D-c and is helpful for better understanding the mechanisms responsible for soil detachment in the WLFZ of the TGR.

AB The channel boundary conditions along the Lower Yellow River (LYR) have been altered significantly since the 1950s with the continual reinforcement and construction of both main and secondary dykes and river training works. To evaluate how the confined complex channel-floodplain system of the LYR responds to floods, this study presents a detailed investigation of the relationship between the tempo-spatial distribution of sedimentation/erosion and overbank floods occurred in the LYR. For large overbank floods, we found that when the sediment transport coefficient (ratio of sediment concentration of flow to flow discharge) is less than 0.034, the bankfull channel is subject to significant erosion, whereas the main and secondary floodplains both accumulate sediment. The amount of sediment deposited on the main and secondary floodplains is closely related to the ratio of peak discharge to bankfull discharge, volume of water flowing over the floodplains, and sediment concentration of overbank flow, whereas the degree of erosion in the bankfull channel is related to the amount of sediment deposited on the main and secondary floodplains, water volume, and sediment load in flood season. The significant increase in erosion in the bankfull channel is due to the construction of the main and secondary dykes and river training works, which are largely in a wide and narrow alternated pattern along the LYR such that the water flowing over wider floodplains returns to the channel downstream after it drops sediment. For small overbank floods, the bankfull channel is subject to erosion when the sediment transport coefficient is less than 0.028, whereas the amount of sediment deposited on the secondary floodplain is associated closely with the sediment concentration of flow. Over the entire length of the LYR, the situation of erosion in the bankfull channel and sediment deposition on the main and secondary floodplains occurred mainly in the upper reach of the LYR, in which a channel wandering in planform has been well developed.

AB In the last decades, human activity has been contributing to climate change that is closely associated with an increase in temperatures, increase in evaporation, intensification of extreme dry and wet rainfall events, and widespread melting of snow and ice. Understanding the intricate linkage between climate warming and the hydrological cycle is crucial for sustainable management of groundwater resources, especially in a vulnerable continent like Africa. This study investigates the relationship between climate-change drivers and potential groundwater recharge (PGR) patterns across Africa for a long-term record (1960-2010). Water-balance components were simulated by using the PCR-GLOBWB model and were reproduced in both gridded maps and latitudinal trends that vary in space with minima on the Tropics and maxima around the Equator. Statistical correlations between temperature, storm occurrences, drought, and PGR were examined in six climatic regions of Africa. Surprisingly, different effects of climate-change controls on PGR were detected as a function of latitude in the last three decades (1980-2010). Temporal trends observed in the Northern Hemisphere of Africa reveal that the increase in temperature is significantly correlated to the decline of PGR, especially in the Northern Equatorial Africa. The climate indicators considered in this study were unable to explain the alarming negative trend of PGR observed in the Sahelian region, even though the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) values report a 15% drought stress. On the other hand, increases in temperature have not been detected in the Southern Hemisphere of Africa, where increasing frequency of storm occurrences determine a rise of PGR, particularly in southern Africa. Time analysis highlights a strong seasonality effect, while PGR is in-phase with rainfall patterns in the summer (Northern Hemisphere) and winter (Southern Hemisphere) and out-of-phase during the fall season. This study helps to elucidate the mechanism of the processes influencing groundwater resources in six climatic zones of Africa, even though modelling results need to be validated more extensively with direct measurements in future studies.

AB To improve quantitative understanding of mixed-land-use impacts on nutrient yields, a nested-scale experimental watershed study design (n = 5) was applied in a 303(d), clean water act impaired urbanizing watershed of the lower Missouri River Basin, USA. From 2010 to 2013, water samples (n = 858 sample days per site) were analysed for total inorganic nitrogen (TIN-N), nitrite (NO2-N) nitrate (NO3-N), ammonia (NH3-N), and total phosphorus (TP-P). Annual, seasonal, and monthly flow-weighted concentrations (FWCs) and nutrient yields were estimated. Mean nutrient concentrations were highest where agricultural land use comprised 58% of the drainage area (NH3 = 0.111 mg/l; NO2 = 0.045 mg/l; NO3 = 0.684 mg/l, TIN = 0.840 mg/l; TP = 0.127 mg/l). Average TP-P increased by 15% with 20% increased urban land use area. Highly variable annual precipitation was observed during the study with highest nutrient yields during 2010 (record setting wet year) and lowest nutrient yields during 2012 (extreme drought year). Annual TIN-N and TP-P yields exceeded 10.3 and 2.04 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) from the agricultural dominated headwaters. Mean annual NH3-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, TIN-N, and TP-P yields were 0.742, 0.400, 4.24, 5.38, and 0.979 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively near the watershed outlet. Precipitation accounted for the majority of the explained variance in nutrient yields (R-2 values from 0.68 to 0.85). Nutrient yields were also dependent on annual precipitation of the preceding year (R-2 values from 0.87 to 0.91) thus enforcing the great complexity of variable mixed-land-use mediated source-sink nutrient yield relationships. Study results better inform land managers and best management practices designed to mitigate nutrient pollution issues in mixed-land-use freshwater ecosystems.

AB Analysis of climate change impacts on streamflow by perturbing the climate inputs has been a concern for many authors in the past few years, but there are few analyses for the impacts on water quality. To examine the impact of change in climate variables on the water quality parameters, the water quality input variables have to be perturbed. The primary input variables that can be considered for such an analysis are streamflow and water temperature, which are affected by changes in precipitation and air temperature, respectively. Using hypothetical scenarios to represent both greenhouse warming and streamflow changes, the sensitivity of the water quality parameters has been evaluated under conditions of altered river flow and river temperature in this article. Historical data analysis of hydroclimatic variables is carried out, which includes flow duration exceedance percentage (e.g. Q90), single low- flow indices (e.g. 7Q10, 30Q10) and relationships between climatic variables and surface variables. For the study region of Tunga-Bhadra river in India, low flows are found to be decreasing and water temperatures are found to be increasing. As a result, there is a reduction in dissolved oxygen (DO) levels found in recent years. Water quality responses of six hypothetical climate change scenarios were simulated by the water quality model, QUAL2K. A simple linear regression relation between air and water temperature is used to generate the scenarios for river water temperature. The results suggest that all the hypothetical climate change scenarios would cause impairment in water quality. It was found that there is a significant decrease in DO levels due to the impact of climate change on temperature and flows, even when the discharges were at safe permissible levels set by pollution control agencies (PCAs). The necessity to improve the standards of PCA and develop adaptation policies for the dischargers to account for climate change is examined through a fuzzy waste load allocation model developed earlier.

TI A PHYSICAL EXPLANATION FOR AN OBSERVED AREA-SLOPE-ELEVATION RELATIONSHIP
   FOR CATCHMENTS WITH DECLINING RELIEF
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTION; MODEL
AB A general relationship between the contributing area, slope, and mean elevation of catchments with relief declining after a tectonic uplift event is presented. This relationship is based on the continuity equation for runoff and erosion processes in the catchment. The key hypothesis underlying this relationship is that as a catchment declines, the nondimensionalized catchment approaches a constant form. This hypothesis is verified for computer simulated catchments. The area-slope-elevation relationship covers several cases: catchments declining toward a peneplain; catchments declining from a high slope dynamic equilibrium (resulting from a high rate of tectonic uplift) to a low slope one (resulting from a lower rate bf tectonic uplift); and catchments declining from an elevated initial condition, as, for example, in the decline of a mine spoil heap. A previously published relationship between slope and area for catchments in dynamic equilibrium and based on runoff and erosion physics is shown to be a special case of this general relationship. The new area-slope-elevation relationship is compared with data from simulated catchments and a field catchment. It is thus shown that for declining catchments the area-slope-elevation relationship is a good predictor of catchment form for catchments with declining relief. It is argued that the slope-area-elevation relationship is sufficient, with the planiform drainage pattern, to completely define the elevation properties of the catchment such as, for instance, the hypsometric curve.

AB [1] Equilibrium temperature is the water temperature at which the sum of all heat fluxes through the water surface is zero. It can be calculated from weather data. Mean weekly stream temperature was found to be linearly related to mean weekly equilibrium temperature above 0 degreesC. The slopes and intercepts of the linear relationship were used to identify effects of shading, sheltering, cold water inputs ( groundwater, meltwater, and deep reservoir releases) and warm water inputs ( wastewater, cooling water, and lake surface water). The linearity hypothesis was confirmed for data from 596 U. S. Geological Survey stream gaging stations in the eastern and central United States. For approximately 15% ( 89 of 596, NSC greater than or equal to 0.90) of stream gaging stations, weekly equilibrium temperature was a good estimator of weekly stream temperature with zero wind sheltering and sun shading. With sheltering and shading the number rose to 26% ( 156 of 596). For these streams the heat exchange through the water surface has the most controlling effect on stream temperatures. For the remaining 74% of streams the relationship between weekly stream temperature and weekly equilibrium temperature was also linear, but its slope was significantly less than 1.0 ( even after calibration for shading and sheltering), indicating that processes other than surface heat exchange have an influence. Cold water inflows were dominant for 8% ( 46 of 596) of stream gaging sites. Less than 5% of all stream gaging stations showed evidence of unnatural heat inputs. Fitting an equilibrium temperature linearly to recorded stream temperatures, e. g., at a weekly timescale, can be of use to project stream temperatures under different weather-climate scenarios or to identify both natural and anthropogenic heat and hydrologic inputs to streams.

AB The hydroclimatology of prairie-dominated portions of the Lake Winnipeg watershed was investigated to determine the possible presence of trends and shifts in variables that may influence the streamflow regimes and water quality of Lake Winnipeg. The total annual streamflow, precipitation, runoff ratio and daily maximum streamflow in the two major tributaries of the Assiniboine River and Red River were analysed for a range of nonstationary behaviours. Each of these rivers has been gauged for more than 90?years. The methods used included a nonparametric MannKendall test modified to account for diverse memory properties (i.e. short term versus long term) and a Bayesian change point detection model to identify possible segments of time series with inconsistent nonstationary behaviour. Although there is no evidence of statistically significant trends in precipitation and streamflow in the Assiniboine River watershed, a shift-type nonstationarity in annual runoff and runoff ratio was observed in this area, which is manifested in the form of a sequence of wet and dry spells during the last century. Precipitation and runoff metrics in the American portion of the study area (i.e. Red River watershed) were characterised with both gradual and abrupt changes with an extremely increasing rate of streamflow beyond that of intensified precipitation. The nonproportional watershed runoff response is attributed to the dynamic nature of contributing areas that, together with the semiarid climate, leads to sudden changes of streamflow due to major or even some times minor changes in climate inputs. It is evident that streamflow in the depression-dominated landscapes of the semiarid glaciated plains of North America is particularly sensitive and vulnerable to minor climate variability and change. This study provides valuable insights into the highly complex precipitationrunoff relationship in depression-dominated landscapes and could have important implications for water management in this part of North America and comparable regions.

AB Continuous wavelet analyses of hourly time series of air temperature, stream discharge, and precipitation are used to compare the seasonal and inter-annual variability in hydrological regimes of the two principal streams feeding Bow Lake, Banff National Park, Alberta: the glacial stream draining the Wapta Icefields, and the snowmelt-fed Bow River. The goal is to understand how water sources and flow routing differ between the two catchments. Wavelet spectra and cross-wavelet spectra were determined for air temperature and discharge from the two streams for summers (June-September) 1997-2000, and for rainfall and discharge for the summers of 1999 and 2000. The diurnal signal of the glacial runoff was orders of magnitude higher in 1998 than in other years, indicating that significant ice exposure and the development of channelized glacial drainage occurred as a result of the 1997-98 El Nino conditions. Early retreat of the snowpack in 1997 and 1998 led to a significant summer-long input of melt runoff from a small area of ice cover in the Bow River catchment; but such inputs were not apparent in 1999 and 2000, when snow cover was more extensive. Rainfall had a stronger influence on runoff and followed quicker flow paths in the Bow River catchment than in the glacial catchment. Snowpack thickness and catchment size were the primary controls on the phase relationship between temperature and discharge at diurnal time scales. Wavelet analysis is a fast and effective means to characterize runoff, temperature, and precipitation regimes and their interrelationships and inter-annual variability. The technique is effective at identifying inter-annual and seasonal changes in the relative contributions of different water sources to runoff, and changes in the time required for routing of diurnal meltwater pulses through a catchment. However, it is less effective at identifying changes/differences in the type of the flow routing (e.g. overland flow versus through flow) between or within catchments.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; VARIABILITY; DISPERSION; SAND
AB A theory of dipole flow is developed to model flow induced by a vertical circulation well consisting of injection and extraction chambers in a single borehole. Included in the theory are an analytical description of the kinematic flow structure around a vertical circulation well and the drawdown in the well chambers. Using Stokes' stream function, simple criteria are derived to determine the region of intensive recirculation. This region extends (from the dipole center) approximately five distances between chamber centers in the radial direction and two distances between chamber centers in both vertical directions. The vertical scale does not depend on anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity, and the radial scale is corrected for anisotropic aquifers. Based on these estimates, criteria are given for the selection of the appropriate aquifer model to employ in five settings, including infinite, semi-infinite confined, semi-infinite unconfined, finite confined, and finite unconfined aquifers. Applications of dipole flow theory are given for analytical estimation of the capture zone for recirculation wells and for simultaneous measurement of horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity in uniform anisotropic aquifers using steady state measurements of drawdown in the well chambers.

AB Although sophisticated models for predicting spatial and temporal rainstorm patterns have been proposed in past decades, the temporal patterns of extreme rainstorm events are still unknown, and the performance of natural and man-made slopes and debris flow mitigation measures have never been assessed from the viewpoint of temporal rainfall patterns. To this end, three methods were used to simulate the hyetograph of an extreme rainstorm, namely, typhoon Morakot, which resulted in a maximum rainfall of 2884 mm in Taiwan from August 6-11, 2009. It was found that Gaussian-based hyetographs better simulated the rainstorm patterns recorded in the study area than conventional triangular and instantaneous intensity methods. Based on a satellite image investigation, a total of 32 events of reported debris flow disasters were identified with accurate times of debris flow strike and clear causative source slope failures adjacent to the disaster sites. Fundamental statistical parameters, namely the simulated time of peak rainfall intensity, t(p), and the standard deviation of rainfall duration, sigma(t), were used to correlate the time of debris flow initiation. It was found that 94% (30 out of 32 events) of the investigated debris flows occurred between t(p) - 0.50 sigma(t) and t(p) + 1.0 sigma(t), suggesting that intensive slope failures and debris flows occurred around the peak of hourly rainfall, associated with the steepest segment of the mass curve. It was also found that sites with larger source slope failure areas tended to have a longer delay between the time of peak hourly rainfall and the occurrence of debris flow. Results of the analyses revealed the potential of improving the accuracy of debris flow predictions using the proposed hyetograph method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A procedure is proposed for basing intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves on partial duration series (PDS) which are substantially larger than those commonly used for this purpose. The PDS are derived from event maxima series (EMS), composed of the maximum average intensities, over a given duration, determined for all rainfall events recorded at a station. The generalized Pareto distribution (GP) is fitted to many PDS nested within the EMS and the goodness-of-fit is determined by the Anderson-Darling test. The best fitted distribution is selected for predicting intensities associated with the given duration and with a number of recurrence intervals. This procedure was repeated for eleven rainfall durations, from 5 to 240 min, at four stations of the Israel Meteorological Service. For comparison, the GP and the generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions were fitted to annual maxima series (AMS) and the Gumbel and lognormal distributions were fitted to the PDS and to the AMS at these stations.
   In almost all cases, the GP distribution well fits to ranges of PDS within an EMS, while in a few cases the best fit is fair only. Another result is that the GP distribution does not fit to AMS and to EMS. The GEV distribution well fits to most AMS, and fairly fits to the others. The Gumbel and the lognormal distributions well fit to most of the AMS and to a very few PDS. In most cases of good fits of different distributions, the predicted values by the different distributions are not much different from one another. This indicates the importance of good fit of the distribution and of the power of the AD test used for determining it. In most cases the best fit of the GP distribution is to a PDS series substantially larger than its corresponding AMS. In most cases, the standard error of he estimated 100-year intensity, through the best fitted CP to PDS, is smaller than that estimated through the GEV fitted to the corresponding AMS. All these make the proposed procedure superior to the current ones. it also enables interpolated predictions down to recurrence intervals of N/n years (N is number of years of complete records and n is PDS size). The use of large samples would reduce the sensitivity of predicted intensities to sampling variations. (C) 2009 Elsevier FIN. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents a catchment characteristic sensitivity analysis concerning the non-linearity of rainfall-runoff response in 120 UK catchments. Two approaches were adopted. The first approach involved, for each catchment, regression of a power-law to flow rate gradient data for recession events only. This approach was referred to as the recession analysis (RA). The second approach involved calibrating a rainfall-runoff model to the full data set (both recession and non-recession events). The rainfall-runoff model was developed by combining a power-law streamflow routing function with a one parameter probability distributed model (PDM) for soil moisture accounting. This approach was referred to as the rainfall-runoff model (RM). Step-wise linear regression was used to derive regionalization equations for the three parameters. An advantage of the RM approach is that it utilizes much more of the observed data. Results from the RM approach suggest that catchments with high base-flow and low annual precipitation tend to exhibit greater non-linearity in rainfall-runoff response. In contrast, the results from the RA approach suggest that non-linearity is linked to low evaporative demand. The difference in results is attributed to the aggregation of storm-flow and base-flow into a single system giving rise to a seemingly more non-linear response when applying the RM approach to catchments that exhibit a strongly dual storm-flow base-flow response. The study also highlights the value and limitations in a regionlization context of aggregating storm-flow and base-flow pathways into a single non-linear routing function. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Baseflow has become an important source of nitrate nonpoint source pollution in many intensive agricultural watersheds. Uncertainties in baseflow nutrient load separation are caused by the effects of hydrometeorological factors on both baseflow recession and baseflow nutrient load recession. These uncertainties have not been addressed well in the existing separating algorithms, which are based on simple baseflow rate-load relationships. In the present study, a recursive tracing source algorithm (RTSA) was developed based on a nonlinear reservoir algorithm and hydrometeorology-corrected baseflow nutrient load recession parameter. This approach was used to reduce the uncertainty of baseflow nitrate load estimation caused by variations in different load recessions under varying climate conditions. RTSA validation in a typical rainy agricultural watershed yielded Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, root mean square error-observation standard deviation ratio, and R-2 values of 0.91, 0.30, and 0.91, respectively. The baseflow nitrate-nitrogen (NNO3-) loads from 2003 to 2012 in the Changle River watershed of eastern China were estimated with the RTSA. The results indicated that baseflow nitrate export accounted for 62.0% of the mean total annual NNO3- loads (18.0 kg/ha). The total baseflow NNO3- export was highest in spring (3.6 kg/ha), followed by summer (3.2 kg/ha), winter (2.3 kg/ha), and autumn (2.1 kg/ha). The contribution of baseflow to total nitrate in the stream decreased in the order of winter (69.88%) >spring (66.59%) >autumn (60.36%) >summer (54.04%). The monthly baseflow NNO3- loads and flow-weighted concentrations greatly increased during the research period (Mann-Kendall test, Z(s) > 2.56, p < .01). Without proper countermeasures, baseflow nitrate may represent a serious long-term risk for water surfaces in the future.

AB Increasing population and intensification of agriculture increase erosion rates and often result in severe land degradation and sedimentation of reservoirs. Finding effective management practices to counteract the increasing sediment load is becoming increasingly urgent especially in the Ethiopian highlands where the construction of the hydroelectric Grand Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile is underway. In this paper, we examine the results of 9years of a watershed experiment in which discharge and sediment losses were observed in the 113ha Anjeni watershed of the Blue Nile Basin. The study period encompasses conditions before, during, and after the installation of graded Fanya-Juu (throw uphill bunds) soil and water conservation practices (SWCP), which had the ultimate goal of creating terraces. We use a saturation-excess runoff model named the parameter-efficient distributed model as a mathematical construct to relate rainfall with discharge and sediment losses at the outlet. The parameter-efficient distributed model is based on landscape units in which the excess rainfall becomes direct runoff or infiltrates based on topographic position or hardpan characteristics. Deviations in this rainfall-discharge-sediment loss relationship are ascribed to the changes in infiltration characteristics caused by SWCPs on the hillslopes. With this technique, we found that in the Anjeni basin, the Fanya-Juu SWCPs are only effective in increasing the infiltration and thereby reducing the direct runoff and sediment concentrations in the first 5years. At the end of the 9-year observation period, the direct runoff and sediment concentrations were barely reduced compared to the levels before SWCP were installed. In addition, we found that the model structure based on landscape units was able to represent the varying runoff and erosion processes during the 9years well by varying mainly the portion of degraded land (and thereby representing the effectiveness of the Fanya-Juu to reduce runoff by increasing infiltration).

ID DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; OUSEBURN; SYSTEM
AB The results of a comparison between chemical water quality determinants and river water fluorescence on the River Tyne, NE England, demonstrate that tryptophan-like fluorescence intensity shows statistically significant relationships between nitrate, phosphate, ammonia, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen. Tryptophan-like fluorescence intensity at the 280 nm excitation/350 nm emission wavelength fluorescence centre correlates with both phosphate (r = 0(.)80) and nitrate (r = 0(.)87), whereas tryptophan-like fluorescence intensity at the 220 nm excitation/350 nm emission wavelength centre correlates with BOD (r = 0(.)85), ammonia (r = 0(.)70) and dissolved oxygen (r = -0(.)65). The strongest correlations are between tryptophan-like fluorescence intensity and nitrate and phosphate, which in the Tyne catchment derive predominantly from point and diffuse source sewage inputs. The correlation between BOD and the tryptophan-like fluorescence intensity suggests that this fluorescence centre is related to the bioavailable or labile dissolved organic matter pool. The weakest correlations are observed between tryptophan-like fluorescence intensity and ammonia concentration and dissolved oxygen. The weaker correlation with ammonia is due to removal of the ammonia signal by wastewater treatment, and that with dissolved oxygen due to the natural aeration of the river such that this is not a good indicator of water quality. The observed correlations only hold true when treated sewage, sewerage overflows or cross connections, or agricultural organic pollutants dominate the water quality-this is not true for two sites where airport deicer (propylene glycol, which is non-fluorescent) or landfill leachate (which contains high concentrations of humic and fulvic-like fluorescent DOM) dominate the dissolved organic matter in the river. Mean annual tryptophan-like fluorescence intensity agrees well with the General Water Quality Assessment as determined by the England and Wales environmental regulators, the Environment Agency.

AB In the semi-arid Mediterranean environment, the rainfall-runoff relationships are complex because of the markedly irregular patterns in rainfall, the seasonal mismatch between evaporation and rainfall, and the spatial heterogeneity in landscape properties. Watersheds often display considerable non-linear threshold behavior, which still make runoff generation an open research question. Our objectives in this context were: to identify the primary processes of runoff generation in a small natural catchment; to test whether a physically based model, which takes into consideration only the primary processes, is able to predict spatially distributed water-table and stream discharge dynamics; and to use the hydrological model to increase our understanding of runoff generation mechanisms. The observed seasonal dynamics of soil moisture, water-table depth, and stream discharge indicated that Hortonian overland-flow was negligible and the main mechanism of runoff generation was saturated subsurface-flow. This gives rise to base-flow, controls the formation of the saturated areas, and contributes to storm-flow together with saturation overland-flow. The distributed model, with a 1D scheme for the kinematic surface-flow, a 2D sub-horizontal scheme for the saturated subsurface-flow, and ignoring the unsaturated flow, performed efficiently in years when runoff volume was high and medium, although there was a smoothing effect on the observed water-table. In dry years, small errors greatly reduced the efficiency of the model. The hydrological model has allowed to relate the runoff generation mechanisms with the land-use. The forested hillslopes, where the calibrated soil conductivity was high, were never saturated, except at the foot of the slopes, where exfiltration of saturated subsurface-flow contributed to storm-flow. Saturation overland-flow was only found near the streams, except when there were storm-flow peaks, when it also occurred on hillslopes used for pasture, where soil conductivity was low. The bedrock-soil percolation, simulated by a threshold mechanism, further increased the non-linearity of the rainfall-runoff processes. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Using lake Stechlin in northeastern Germany as an example of a small groundwater-feed lake without surface inflows and outflows, we estimated the temporal scales and the variability ranges of the net groundwater contribution to the lake water budget. High-resolution water level measurements by a bottom-mounted pressure logger provided the background for the estimation of the total lake water budget. This method has demonstrated reliability for estimation of lake level variations during periods ranging from subdiurnal to perennial. The typical amplitudes of the synoptic-to-perennial variability characterizing the groundwater climate of lake Stechlin are estimated by comparing the two subsequent years 2006 and 2007; one of these years shows an extremely high, and the other an extremely low, annual precipitation-evaporation balance. The net groundwater flow, estimated as the difference between the total water budget and the precipitation-evaporation balance at the surface, revealed synoptic effects of lake water exfiltration into the groundwater aquifer following strong precipitation events. Perennial variations between wet and dry years superimposed seasonal oscillations. The probable origin of the latter is seasonality in the groundwater level on the watershed, although the exact amplitudes are subject to further quantification on account of seasonality in the evaporation estimation error. The results emphasize the non-stationary behaviour of groundwater flow on timescales shorter than climatic ones. The analysis yielded a net quantitative relationship between groundwater flow and water balance at the lake surface: The water level changes in the lake due to evaporation and precipitation are damped to 60% because of the lake-groundwater exchange by means of intermittent infiltration and exfiltration events. Assuming the remaining 40% of the surface water budget may potentially result in perennial water level variability, we estimated an effect of the precipitation decrease on the lake water budget as predicted by the regional climate scenarios for the next century.

AB Despite the availability of numerous approaches to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET), temperature-based PET equations such as the Hamon equation and Thornthwaite equation are still used to predict changes in hydrology in a changing climate as temperature is one of the primary reported outputs from general circulation models. To isolate the actual dependence of PET on temperature, we analysed meteorological and energy balance measurements from five AmeriFlux deciduous forest sites in the eastern United States during periods with minimal soil moisture control on transpiration. For all five sites, when PET measurements with similar net radiation are grouped, temperature does not correlate to PET within each group. Conversely when PET measurements with similar temperature are grouped, net radiation strongly correlates to PET within each group. In terms of assessing standard PET models, when dormant and growing season PET are separated, we found that the Priestley-Taylor equation (a model primarily dependent on net radiation) consistently explained more of the variation in PET than temperature-based methods such as the Hamon equation (median R-2 of 0.88 vs 0.66). We illustrate that the moderate ability of temperature-based equations to predict PET arises from the correlation between temperature and net radiation when the meteorological observations are averaged over at least several days. However, we suggest that because temperature is not the fundamental driver of PET and because the relationship between temperature and net radiation underlying temperature-based equations will shift with climate change, temperature-based equations in their current state will likely exaggerate PET in a changing climate.

AB This paper synthesizes 10-years' worth of interannual time-series space-borne ERS-1 and RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected coincident with daily measurement of snow-covered, land-fast first-year sea ice (FYI) geophysical and surface radiation data collected from the Seasonal Sea Ice Monitoring and Modeling Site, Collaborative-Interdisciplinary Cryospheric Experiment and 1998 North Water Polynya study over the period 1992 to 2002. The objectives are to investigate the seasonal co-relationship of the SAR time-series dataset with selected surface mass (bulk snow thickness) and climate state variables (surface temperature and albedo) measured in situ for the purpose of measuring the interannual variability of sea ice spring melt transitions and validating a time-series SAR methodology for sea ice surface mass and climate state parameter estimation. We begin with a review of the salient processes required for our interpretation of time-series microwave backscatter from land-fast FYI. Our results suggest that time-series SAR data can reliably measure the timing and duration of surface albedo transitions at daily to weekly time-scales and at a spatial scales that are on the order of hundreds of metres. Snow thickness on FYI immediately prior to melt onset explains a statistically significant portion of the variability in timing of SAR-detected melt onset to pond onset for SAR time-series that are made up of more than 25 images. Our results also show that the funicular regime of snowmelt, resolved in time-series SAR data at a temporal resolution of approximately 2.5 images per week, is not detectable for snow covers less than 25 curt in thickness.

AB In Mediterranean regions, hillslopes are generally considered to be a mosaic of sink and source areas that control runoff generation and water erosion processes. These hillslopes used to be characterized by a complex hydrological and erosive response combining Hortonian and saturation excess overland flows. The hydrological response of soils is highly dependent on the soil surface components (e.g. vegetation patches, bare soil, rock fragment cover, crusts), which each one of them is dominated by a certain hydrological process. One of these soil surface components, not widely considered in studies of soil hydrology under Mediterranean conditions, is the accumulation of litter beneath shrubs enhancing water repellency in soils. This study investigates the influence of soil surface components, especially the litter accumulated beneath Cistus spp., in the hydrological and erosive responses of soils on two Mediterranean hillslopes having different exposures. The study was performed by means of rainfall simulation experiments and the Water Drop Penetration Time for measuring water repellency of soils, both techniques being carried out at the end of summer (September 2010) with very dry soils. The results indicate that (i) soil surface components from the north facing hillslope are characterized by a more uniform hydrological and erosive response than those from the south-facing ones; (ii) the water repellency is more influential on the hydrological response of the north-facing hillslope due to a greater accumulation of organic rest on the soils as the vegetation cover is also higher; (iii) the south-facing hillslope seemed to follow the fertility island theory with very degraded bare soil areas, which are the most generated areas of runoff and mobilized sediments; (iv) the experimental area can be considered as a threshold area between the semiarid and subhumid Mediterranean environments, with the south-facing hillslope being comparable with the former and the north facing one with the latter.

AB Semi-arid to temperate south-east Australian catchments with agricultural landscapes demonstrate unique hydro-climatic characteristics. Understanding the behaviour of soil moisture over such catchments and the influence of driving factors are crucial for hydrologic, climatic and agricultural applications. However, this is challenging due the complex, non-linear relationship between these factors and soil moisture, and the lack of long-term catchment scale data records. To address this, spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture over two south-east Australian river catchments (i.e., Krui and Merriwa) and the influence of soil texture, topography, vegetation and rainfall on soil moisture variability were evaluated using a decadal in-situ dataset. This unique in-situ soil moisture monitoring network is established over a semi-arid to temperate catchment representing typical south-east Australian agricultural landscape and the data record has captured some major climatic events. Time stability of catchment-scale soil moisture and the potential of predicting catchment mean soil moisture content using one representative station were also examined using a linear regression model. Soil texture was found as the dominating factor driving the spatial variability of soil moisture in the area. The temporal patterns of soil moisture showed a positive agreement with vegetation dynamics and rainfall at topsoil layers (0-5 cm and 0-30 cm). A higher spatial variability of soil moisture was observed during dry catchment conditions compared to wet catchment conditions. The deeper soil layers (30-60 cm and 60-90 cm) showed highly stable soil moisture values, which might be the driving force of the agriculture in the area. A linear regression based prediction model demonstrated a good potential in estimating spatial mean soil moisture content from one representative station. The results are useful in parameterization of soil moisture variability in land surface, climatic and hydrologic models, agricultural applications and in remote sensing of soil moisture.

AB Most terrestrial allochthonous organic matter enters river networks through headwater streams during high flow events. In headwaters, allochthonous inputs are substantial and variable, but become less important in streams and rivers with larger watersheds. As allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) moves downstream, the proportion of less aromatic organic matter with autochthonous characteristics increases. How environmental factors converge to control this transformation of DOM at a continental scale is less certain. We hypothesized that the amount of time water has spent travelling through surface waters of inland systems (streams, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs) is correlated to DOM composition. To test this hypothesis, we used established river network scaling relationships to predict relative river network flow-weighted travel time (FWTT) of water for 60 stream and river sites across the contiguous United States (3090 discrete samples over 10 water years). We estimated lentic contribution to travel times with upstream in-network lake and reservoir volume. DOM composition was quantified using ultraviolet and visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. A combination of FWTT and lake and reservoir volume was the best overall predictor of DOM composition among models that also incorporated discharge, specific discharge, watershed area, and upstream channel length. DOM spectral slope ratio (R-2 = 0.77) and Freshness Index (R-2 = 0.78) increased and specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (R-2 = 0.68) and Humification Index (R-2 = 0.44) decreased across sites as a function of FWTT and upstream lake volume. This indicates autochthonous-like DOM becomes continually more dominant in waters with greater FWTT. We assert that river FWTT can be used as a metric of the continuum of DOM composition from headwaters to rivers. The nature of the changes to DOM composition detected suggest this continuum is driven by a combination of photo-oxidation, biological processes, hydrologically varying terrestrial subsidies, and aged groundwater inputs.

AB Soils derived from different lithologies and their controls on preferential flow remain underexplored in forested landscapes. In the same lithology, the propensity for preferential flow occurrence at different hillslope positions also remains largely elusive. By utilizing a soil moisture response time method, we compared preferential flow occurrence between a shale site (Shale Hills, silt loam soils) and a sandstone site (Garner Run, sandy loam soils) at four hillslope positions: ridge-top, North- and South-facing mid-slopes and toe slope, for over 2 years. The catchments are neighbouring and covered by temperate forest. For the four hillslope positions, Shale Hills had higher preferential flow frequencies compared to Garner Run. Between these two catchments, the South-facing mid-slope sites showed the highest contrasts in preferential flow frequency (33.5% of events at Shale Hills vs. 8.8% at Garner Run) while the ridge-top sites showed the lowest contrasts (18.7 vs. 13.2%). Additionally, over the unfrozen period, for seven out of eight monitoring sites, drier antecedent conditions tended to be more favourable for preferential flows to occur, with significant (p < .01) relationships at two sites. Except for the South-facing mid-slope sites, both Shale Hills and Garner Run had two preferential flow pathways. The characteristic preferential flow pathways at Shale Hills were the B(w)and C horizons, and for Garner Run, preferential flow moved from the E/AE horizon to the B(w)horizon. This study shows that shale-derived soils tended to have higher preferential flow occurrence than sandstone soils, but hillslope positions exhibit different levels of contrasts. More effort should be paid to study the impact of lithology on preferential flows in the context of land surface modelling and biogeochemical reactions to improve ecosystem services of headwater catchments.

AB In this study, we investigated rainfall, run-off, and sediment transport dynamics (414 run-off events and 231 events with sediment information) of a humid mountain badland areathe Araguas catchment (Central Pyrenees, Spain)from October 2005 to September 2016. Use of this long-term database allows characterization of the hydrological response, which consist of low-magnitude/high-frequency events and high-magnitude/low-frequency events, and identification of seasonal dynamics and rainfall-run-off thresholds. Our results indicate that the Araguas catchment, similarly to other humid badlands, had high hydrological responsiveness (mean annual run-off coefficient: 0.52), a non-linear relationship of rainfall with run-off (common in Mediterranean environments), and seasonal hydrological and sedimentological dynamics. We created and validated a multivariate regression model to characterize the hydrological variables (stormflow and peak discharge) and sedimentological variables (mean and maximum suspended sediment concentrations and total suspended sediment load). In summer and at the beginning of autumn, the response was mainly related to rainfall intensity, suggesting a predomination of Hortonian flows. In contrast, in spring and winter, the responses were mainly related to the antecedent conditions (previous rainfall and baseflow), suggesting the occurrence of saturated excess flow processes, and the contribution of neighbouring vegetated areas. The multivariate analysis also showed that total sediment load is better predicted by a multivariate regression model that integrates pre-event, rainfall, and run-off variables. In general, our models provided more accurate predictions of small-magnitude/high-frequency events than high-magnitude/low-frequency events. This study highlights the high inter- and intra-annual variability response in humid badland areas and that long-term records are needed to reduce the uncertainty of hydrological and sedimentological responses in Mediterranean badland areas.

AB The processes that control run-off quantity and quality in urban watersheds are complex and not well understood. Although impervious surface coverage has traditionally been used to examine altered hydrologic response in urban watersheds, several studies suggest that other elements of the urban landscape, particularly those associated with urban infrastructure and the drainage system, play an equally important role. The relative importance of impervious surfaces, stormwater ponds, expansion of the drainage network, and drainage network structures in controlling hydrologic response was examined in the subwatersheds of the Kromma Kill, an urban watershed located in Albany County, NY. In this study, geographic information systems was used to compute geospatial land surface and drainage network properties of 5 Kromma Kill subwatersheds. In these same subwatersheds, water quantity (rainfall and run-off) and quality (macroinvertebrates, nitrate, total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and nonpurgable organic carbon) parameters were measured. Strong and significant correlations were identified between land surface and drainage network properties and field observations. Causal relationships were then tested using the Environmental Protection Agency's Stormwater Management Model. Field and model analyses suggest that whereas percent imperviousness is a dominant control on water quality, drainage density and slope are equally important. However, for water quantity, whereas imperviousness is positively correlated with increased run-off volumes, drainage network properties and slope are the dominant controls on run-off volumes. Results have important implications for stormwater management plans, especially those aimed at reducing the effective impervious surface coverage of urban watersheds. Reducing the percentage of effective imperviousness in a watershed is not a one size fits all solution and can help to meet some management objectives, such as reducing nitrogen concentrations and improving water quality, but may not serve as the most effective, and therefore economical, solution for every management objective including reducing run-off volumes.

AB Determination of saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s, and the shape parameters and n of the water retention curve, (h), is of paramount importance to characterize the water flow in the vadose zone. This work presents a modified upward infiltration method to estimate K-s, and n from numerical inverse analysis of the measured cumulative upward infiltration (CUI) at multiple constant tension lower boundary conditions. Using the HYDRUS-2D software, a theoretical analysis on a synthetic loam soil under different soil tensions (0, 0-10, 0-50 and 0-100cm), with and without an overpressure step of 10cm high from the top boundary condition at the end of the upward infiltration process, was performed to check the uniqueness and the accuracy of the solutions. Using a tension sorptivimeter device, the method was validated in a laboratory experiment on five different soils: a coarse and a fine sand, and a 1-mm sieved loam, clay loam and silt-gypseous soils. The estimated and n parameters were compared to the corresponding values measured with the TDR-pressure cell method. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that K-s and (h) can be simultaneously estimated from measured upward cumulative infiltration when high (>50cm) soil tensions are initially applied at the lower boundary. Alternatively, satisfactory results can be also obtained when medium tensions (<50cm) and the K-s calculated from the overpressure step at the end of the experiment are considered. A consistent relationship was found between the (R-2=0.86, p<0.02) and n (R-2=0.97, p<0.001) values measured with the TDR-pressure cell and the corresponding values estimated with the tension sorptivimeter. The error between the (in logarithm scale) and n values estimated with the inverse analysis and the corresponding values measured with pressure chamber were 3.1 and 6.1%, respectively.

AB Frequent algal blooms in surface water bodies caused by nutrient loading from agricultural lands are an ongoing problem in many regions globally. Tile drains beneath poorly and imperfectly drained agricultural soils have been identified as key pathways for phosphorus (P) transport. Two tile drains in an agricultural field with sandy loam soil in southern Ontario, Canada were monitored over a 28-month period to quantify discharge and the concentrations and loads of dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total P (TP) in their effluent. This paper characterizes seasonal differences in runoff generation and P export in tile drain effluent and relates hydrologic and biogeochemical responses to precipitation inputs and antecedent soil moisture conditions. The generation of runoff in tile drains was only observed above a clear threshold soil moisture content (similar to 0.49m(3)center dot m(-3) in the top 10cm of the soil; above field capacity and close to saturation), indicating that tile discharge responses to precipitation inputs were governed by the available soil-water storage capacity of the soil. Soil moisture content approached this threshold throughout the non-growing season (October - April), leading to runoff responses to most events. Concentrations of P in effluent were variable throughout the study but were not correlated with discharge (p > 0.05). However, there were significant relationships between discharge volume (mm) and DRP and TP loads (kg ha(-1)) for events occurring over the study period (R-2 >= 0.49, p <= 0.001). This research has shown that the hydrologic and biogeochemical responses of tile drains in a sandy loam soil can be predicted to within an order of magnitude from simple hydrometric data such as precipitation and soil moisture once baseline conditions at a site have been determined.

AB Regimes are useful tools for characterizing the seasonal behaviour of river flow and other hydroclimatological variables over an annual cycle (hydrological year). This paper develops and tests: (i) a regime classification method to identify spatial and temporal patterns in intraannual hydroctimatological response; and (ii) a novel sensitivity index (SI) to assess river flow regimes' climatic sensitivity. The classification of regime shape (form) and magnitude considers the whole annual cycle rather than isolating a single month or season for analysis, which has been the common approach of previous studies. The classification method is particularly useful for identifying large-scale patterns in regimes and their between-year stability, thus providing a context for short-term, small-scale process-based research. The SI provides a means of assessing the often-complex linkages between climatic drivers and river flow, as it identifies the strength and direction of associations between classifications of climate and river flow regimes. The SI has the potential for application to other problems where relationships between nominal classifications require to be found. These techniques are evaluated by application to a test data set of river flow, air temperature and rainfall time-series (1974-1999) for a sample of 35 UK river basins. The results support current knowledge about the hydroclimatology of the UK. Although this research does not seek to yield new, detailed physical process understanding, it provides perspective at large spatial and temporal scales upon climate and flow regime patterns and quantifies linkages. Having clearly demonstrated the regime classification and SI to be effective in an environment where the hydroclimatology is relatively well known, there appears to be much to gain from applying these techniques in parts of the world where patterns and associations between climate and hydrology are poorly understood.

AB A modified Green-and-Ampt model is formulated to quantify infiltration on sloping terrain underlain by homogeneous soil wetted by surficial water application. This paper's theory for quantifying infiltration relies on the mathematical statement of the coupled partial differential equations (pdes) governing infiltration and runoff. These pdes are solved by employing an explicit finite-difference numerical method that yields the infiltration, the infiltration rate, the depth to the wetting front, the rate of runoff, and the depth of runoff everywhere on the slope during external wetting. Data inputs consist of a water application rate or the rainfall hyetograph of a storm of arbitrary duration, soil hydraulic characteristics and antecedent moisture, and the slope's hydraulic and geometric characteristics. The presented theory predicts the effect an advancing wetting front has on slope stability with respect to translational sliding. This paper's theory also develops the 1D pde governing suspended sediment transport and slope degradation caused by runoff influenced by infiltration. Three examples illustrate the application of the developed theory to calculate infiltration and runoff on a slope and their role on the stability of cohesive and cohesionless soils forming sloping terrain.

   PROPERTIES OF THE LINEAR CHANNEL RESPONSE
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
AB The use of dimensionless cumulants to characterize the shape of the linear response of a semi-infinite prismatic channel is extended and simplified by means of the dimensionless coefficient (gamma(R)) linking the Rth order shape factor to the 3rd order shape factor raised to the power of (R - 2). It is shown that, for the special structure of the cumulants of the linearized St. Venant equations, the dimensionless cumulant coefficient (gamma(R)) of any order R > 4 is a single-valued function of gamma(4). It is also shown that the value of gamma(R) for any Froude number F-0 combined with any shape of section and any friction law (both characterized by the parameter m) is intermediate between the values for the two limiting cases of the diffusion analogy model (F-0 = 0) and the rapid flow model (F-0 = 1). The dimensionless cumulant coefficient gamma(R) is related to gamma(4) through a parameter p(m, F-0) by a polynomial of order [R/2] - 1.

AB Soil moisture plays an important role in partitioning rainfall into runoff and evapotranspiration. Due to advancements in remotely sensed soil moisture data acquisition techniques, many soil moisture data assimilation (SMDA) studies have been conducted to improve streamflow prediction. It is thus expected that the outcome of a SMDA exercise will be determined by the quality of soil moisture data in hand and the hydrology of the catchment. Our study begins with the hypothesis that it is possible to determine the usefulness of a satellite-based soil moisture data product for areas where paramaterizing a complex model is difficult due to availability of limited information. To this end, we use satellite-based GLDAS root-zone soil moisture data with dynamic Budyko (DB), rainfall-runoff model, to improve streamflow prediction for 60 US basins. Our results suggest that there is a reasonably good one-to-one or universal relationship between instantaneous dryness-index (phi), the key state variable of the DB model, and root-zone soil moisture (theta), which implies that the model can directly use soil moisture information for predicting streamflow. To check the robustness of the universal phi-theta relationship, we also developed basin specific phi-theta relationships. Model performance, expressed in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), improved in 34 basins when we considered the universal phi-0 relationship and in 51 basins when we considered the basin specific relationships. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis reveals that change in NSE due to the use of soil moisture information is predicted quite well by certain basin characteristics. In particular, it is found that available water capacity and forest area positively influence NSE, whereas average sand, silt and clay contents, latitude, and longitude affect it negatively. A slightly stronger MLR relationship was observed while considering soil moisture deficit (the difference between saturated soil moisture and actual soil moisture) in place of soil moisture. From the stepwise MLR analysis, it is observed that the vegetation and runoff generation mechanism control the parameters of the phi-theta relationship. Overall, our study provides a framework to determine the suitability of remotely-based soil moisture data for hydrological modelling.

AB The simplicity of the hydrochemical stationarity concept renders it attractive for partitioning solutes between geogenic and anthropogenic sources. The current study used a small urban headwater stream in a seasonally dry environment to address two research questions: (1) What concentration (C) discharge (Q) patterns exist in small urban headwater streams?; and (2) Do the C-Q patterns persist across C-Q metrics and temporal scales? Four C-Q metrics were tested: concentration-discharge (C-Q), concentration-cumulative discharge (C-EQ), load (L)-discharge (L-Q) and normalized concentration normalized discharge (NC-NQ). C-Q and NC-NQ revealed discharge-invariant behaviour for Ca, two linear relationships with threshold-like transitions from negative to positive slopes for Mg, K and Na, and positive linear relationships for Fe, Pb and PO43-. The threshold-like transitions with distinct breakpoints were more apparent in C-Sigma Q patterns for all solutes. These patterns are consistent with three hypotheses: (1) negative linear to zero slope relationships indicate dilution followed by discharge-invariant behaviour (Ca); (2) negative to positive linear relationships (Mg, K and Na) point to dilution followed by solute enrichment or flushing; and (3) positive to negative linear relationships (Pb, Fe and PO43-) suggest initial solute mobilization followed by dilution. The three dominant behaviours were robust across weekly, fortnightly and monthly timescales. Significant linear L-Q relationships were observed for all solutes, suggesting that loads can be predicted from discharge. Our findings suggest that C-Q relationships are highly dynamic, and multiple processes control streamflow hydrochemistry at different times depending on antecedent discharge. The application of multiple C-Q metrics provided additional insights not apparent by using a single metric. The insights are critical to understanding of catchment hydrology and conceptual representation of hydrochemical processes in models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, the Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining (AI&DM) models have become popular tools in assisting various aspects of reservoir operation. However, the practical uses are still rarely reported. Comparison experiment of many AI&DM models over a large number of reservoir cases is particularly valuable to help reservoir operators first examine the usefulness and transferability of different AI&DM models, and then identify the most stable and reliable AI&DM model in assist of various decision-making processes. In this study, a total of 12 AI&DM models with different parameterizations and simulation scenarios are comprehensively tested out and compared in simulating the controlled reservoir outflows of 33 reservoir cases over the Upper Colorado Region, United States. Results show that the Random Forecast and the Long-Short-Term-Memory model could consistently derive the best statistical performance than other models under the baseline simulation scenario. The employed AI&DM models could obtain satisfactory statistical interquartile ranges (25-75%) between [0.6-0.9], [0.3-0.8], and [0.2-0.8], for CORR, NSE, and KGE measurements, respectively, and [1.5-6.5], [-15 to 20], and [0.5-8.5] for the normalized RMSE, PBIAS and RSR measurements, respectively. Results also show Multi-Layer Perceptron model and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree Algorithm produced more stable and superior performance than other models under more complex input scenarios. We also found that the performance of different AI&DM models are closely relevant to the reservoir elevations, sizes, and functionalities. Discussions were made about the sensitivity of AI&DM models' parameterizations and the key advantages of AI&DM models over the rule-based reservoir models. We further identify that the main advantage of AI&DM models is the flexibility in designing input structures, whereas the rule-based simulation model is rather limited. Future studies were suggested regarding the best way reservoir operators and researchers could use, select, and apply different AI&DM models in simulating reservoir releases under different natural and modeling environments. This comparison study also serves as a reference and a piece of groundwork for further promoting the practical uses of AI&DM models in assisting reservoir operation.

AB Seasonally variation of water salinity is observed worldwide, the mechanisms of water salinity are not well understood due to natural factors and anthropogenic activities. Quantification water salinity source are challenging since complex influence factors, especially in agricultural regions irrigated with multi-water sources. In the lowland area of North China Plain, transferred water, brackish shallow groundwater and fresh deep groundwater were combinative utilized to relieve prominent contradictions between regional water shortages and grain production. In this study, influence factors of surface water (canal water, pond water) and shallow groundwater salinity were identified and quantified through statistical analysis, deuterium excess, and ionic relationship. Salinity of canal water and pond water increased in dry season and decreased in rainy season, while salinity of shallow groundwater decreased in dry season after water transfer and rainy season, but increased in dry season. Evaporation and mineral dissolution were main factors for surface water salinity in dry season, with mineral dissolution was the more important one. The contribution ratio of evaporation and mineral dissolution for canal salinity were 4.4 and 49.1% in dry season after water transfer, 7.1 and 34.4% in dry season, and that for pond water salinity were 12.4 and 18.3% in dry season, respectively. Precipitation and surface runoff were main factors for surface water salinity in rainy season. The contribution of surface runoff for canal water and pond water salinity were 66.1 and 45.8%, respectively. Salinity of canal water and shallow groundwater was temporary decreased by water transfer. Domestic sewage from rural areas had larger influence than agricultural activities for salinity increase of pond water and shallow groundwater. Mineral dissolution was the main contributor for shallow groundwater salinity, with contribution ratio larger than 60% in different periods. This study demonstrated and quantified salinity source of surface water and shallow groundwater and may deepen our understanding of water management under multi-water resources utilization.

TI Isotope mixing models require individual isotopic tracer content for
   correct quantification of sediment source contributions

AB The use of isotopic tracers for sediment source apportionment is gaining interest with recent introduction of compound-specific stable isotope tracers. The method relies on linear mixing of source isotopic tracers, and deconvolution of a sediment mixture initially quantifies the contribution of sources to the mixture's tracer signature. Therefore, a correction to obtain real sediment source proportions is subsequently required. As far as we are aware, all published studies to date have used total isotopic tracer content or a proxy (e.g., soil carbon content) for this post-unmixing correction. However, as the relationship between the isotopic tracer mixture and the source mixture is different for each isotopic tracer, post-unmixing corrections cannot be carried out with one single factor. This contribution presents an isotopic tracer model structurethe concentration-dependent isotope mixing model (CD-IMM)to overcome this limitation. Herein, we aim to clarify why the conventional approach to converting isotopic tracer proportions to source proportions using a single factor is wrong. In an initial mathematical assessment, error incurred by not using CD-IMM (NCD-IMM) in unmixing two sources with two isotopic tracers showed a complex relation as a function of relative tracer contents. Next, three artificial mixtures with different proportions of three soil sources were prepared and deconvoluted using C-13 of fatty acids using CD-IMM and NCD-IMM. Using NCD-IMM affected both accuracy (mean average error increased up to a threefold compared with the CD-IMM output) and precision (interquartile range was up to 2.5 times larger). Finally, as an illustrative example, the proportional source contribution reported in a published study was recalculated using CD-IMM. This resulted in changes in estimated source proportions and associated uncertainties. Content of isotopic tracers is seldom reported in published work concerning use of isotopic tracers for sediment source partitioning. The magnitude of errors made by miscalculation in former studies is therefore difficult to assess. With this contribution, we hope the community will acknowledge the limitations of prior approaches and use a CD-IMM in future studies.

AB Distributed hydrologic models based on triangulated irregular networks (TIN) provide a means for computational efficiency in small to large-scale watershed modelling through an adaptive, multiple resolution representation of complex basin topography. Despite previous research with TIN-based hydrology models, the effect of triangulated terrain resolution on basin hydrologic response has received surprisingly little attention. Evaluating the impact of adaptive gridding on hydrologic response is important for determining the level of detail required in a terrain model. In this study, we address the spatial sensitivity of the TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS) in order to assess the variability in the basin-averaged and distributed hydrologic response (water balance, runoff mechanisms, surface saturation, groundwater dynamics) with respect to changes in topographic resolution. Prior to hydrologic simulations, we describe the generation of TIN models that effectively capture topographic and hydrographic variability from grid digital elevation models. In addition, we discuss the sampling methods and performance metries utilized in the spatial aggregation of triangulated terrain models. For a 64 km(2) catchment in northeastern Oklahoma, we conduct a multiple resolution validation experiment by utilizing the tRIBS model over a wide range of spatial aggregation levels. Hydrologic performance is assessed as a function of the terrain resolution, with the variability in basin response attributed to variations in the coupled surface-subsurface dynamics. In particular, resolving the near-stream, variable source area is found to be a key determinant of model behaviour as it controls the dynamic saturation pattern and its effect on rainfall partitioning. A relationship between the hydrologic sensitivity to resolution and the spatial aggregation of terrain attributes is presented as an effective means for selecting the model resolution. Finally, the study highlights the important effects of terrain resolution on distributed hydrologic model response and provides insight into the multiple resolution calibration and validation of TIN-based hydrology models.

AB Environmental engineering geological patterns (EEGPs) are the generalized manifestation of environmental engineering geology with the protection of phreatic water resources as the core, especially in mining areas with fragile eco-geological environment. Based on the formation mechanism of mining-induced EEGPs, with the aim of win-win between protection of phreatic water resources and exploitation of coal resources, this study presents a zoning method for EEGPs. Taking the Yushenfu mining area in northern Shaanxi, China, as a case study, four types of EEGPs (basically unaffected model, gradually restored model after destruction, gradually deteriorated model, and disaster model) were defined separately. On the basis of the degree of influence of mining activities on phreatic aquifer, the zoning method for EEGPs was proposed. Firstly, the height of water-flowing fractured zone (WFFZ) and the residual aquifuge thickness were calculated using multivariate linear regression method. Secondly, according to the relationship among phreatic water leakage, groundwater recharge, and variation in groundwater level, the thickness of laterite, loess and bedrock as the thresholds between the EEGPs were separately determined. Thirdly, based on the thresholds between EEGPs and the linear variation of residual aquifuge thickness combination, the zoning criteria for EEGPs were formulated. Finally, the zoning results were obtained. Furthermore, the verification of the types of EEGPs in coalfaces and the comparison between the zoning results obtained using variable weight theory and those given in the present study indicated that the zoning results presented in the current study are more accurate and reasonable. The research results can provide theoretical basis for solving the contradiction between coal resource exploitation and eco-geological environmental protection.

AB It is critical for monthly water balance models (MWBMs) to achieve realistic hydrological modelling of total flow and its components (i.e. quick flow and baseflow) in practical application. Various methods have been developed to improve the performances of the three flow components by focusing on calibration procedures. However, the understanding of runoff partitioning structure in MWBMs for better performances is still very limited, especially whether the storage-discharge relationship is linear or nonlinear at monthly time scale. In this study, model structures for baseflow simulation in 5 widely used MWBMs are reviewed and modified from a linear storage-discharge relationship to a nonlinear exponential storage-discharge relationship to achieve realistic baseflow simulation in 443 catchments from Australia with diverse hydro-climatic conditions. The performances of original and modified models are evaluated and compared through four assessment criteria including Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), logarithmic form of NSE (NSE(log)), Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and Bias (B). Basically, the original models with linear storage-discharge relationship perform satisfactorily in simulating total streamflow and quick flow, but degrade remarkably for simulating baseflow with an underestimation of -60 +/- 36% in all study catchments. The modified MWBMs with nonlinear storage-discharge relationship significantly outperform the original ones for simulating both total streamflow and baseflow. The assessment criteria NSE, NSE(log), r and B of total streamflow improve in 82 +/- 4.0% (mean +/- 1 standard deviation of 5 MWBMs), 72 +/- 4.7%, 76 +/- 4.5% and 51 +/- 2.4% study catchments, respectively. The NSE(log) and r of baseflow simulated using the modified MWBMs have improved in 68 +/- 4.6% and 83 +/- 4.1% catchments with median improvement of 0.17 +/- 0.03 and 0.14 +/- 0.03, respectively. It suggests that the exponential nonlinear storage-discharge relationship is more capable for MWBMs to capture storage-discharge dynamics than the linear one at monthly time scale. This study highlights that, at monthly time scale, the nonlinearity in catchment storage-discharge relationship is a very important factor for MWBMs performance and more studies are required to reveal catchment monthly runoff generation mechanisms.

AB We use two hydrological models of varying complexity to study the Juncal River Basin in the Central Andes of Chile with the aim to understand the degree of conceptualization and the spatial structure that are needed to model present and future streamflows. We use a conceptual semi-distributed model based on elevation bands [Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP)], frequently used for water management, and a physically oriented, fully distributed model [Topographic Kinematic Wave Approximation and Integration ETH Zurich (TOPKAPI-ETH)] developed for research purposes mainly. We evaluate the ability of the two models to reproduce the key hydrological processes in the basin with emphasis on snow accumulation and melt, streamflow and the relationships between internal processes. Both models are capable of reproducing observed runoff and the evolution of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer snow cover adequately. In spite of WEAP's simple and conceptual approach for modelling snowmelt and its lack of glacier representation and snow gravitational redistribution as well as a proper routing algorithm, this model can reproduce historical data with a similar goodness of fit as the more complex TOPKAPI-ETH. We show that the performance of both models can be improved by using measured precipitation gradients of higher temporal resolution. In contrast to the good performance of the conceptual model for the present climate, however, we demonstrate that the simplifications in WEAP lead to error compensation, which results in different predictions in simulated melt and runoff for a potentially warmer future climate. TOPKAPI-ETH, using a more physical representation of processes, depends less on calibration and thus is less subject to a compensation of errors through different model components. Our results show that data obtained locally in ad hoc short-term field campaigns are needed to complement data extrapolated from long-term records for simulating changes in the water cycle of high-elevation catchments but that these data can only be efficiently used by a model applying a spatially distributed physical representation of hydrological processes.

AB The influence of land use patterns on water quality in a river system is scale-dependent. In this study, a four-order hierarchical arrangement method was used to select water sampling sites and to delineate sub-basins in the Daliao River Basin, China. The 20 sub-basins were classified into four spatial scales that represented four different stream orders. Pearson correlation analysis was used to quantify relationships between land use composition and the river's physical-chemical variables for all samples collected. This analysis showed that the presence of forest cover was associated with higher water quality at the scale of the whole basin. The scale effects of land use patterns on water quality were then examined using stepwise multiple regression analysis that compared different land use types with water quality variables. The results from this analysis showed that urban areas, as opposed to forest areas, became the most significant contributors of water pollutants when scale effects were considered. The influence of urban land cover on water pollution was significantly higher at larger scales. The lack of a significant regression correlation for the forest land use type at smaller scales revealed that forest located upstream of the Daliao River Basin did not provide a buffer for improved water quality. Further analysis showed that this result could be because of disproportionate spatial distributions for forest and urban land use types. The topographic characteristics of sub-basins, such as average slope (S) and size (A), were determined to be secondary explanatory variables that affected land use impacts on stream water quality. Areas with steep slopes were associated with increased water oxygenation, whereas areas with flatter slopes were associated with higher concentrations of pollutants. These results are significant because they can provide a better understanding of the appropriate spatial scale required for effective river basin management in the future.

AB Entrapped biogenic gas in peat can greatly affect peatland biogeochemical and hydrological processes by altering volumetric water content, peat buoyancy, and 'saturated' hydraulic conductivity, and by generating over-pressure zones. These over-pressure zones further affect hydraulic gradients which influence water and nutrient flow direction and rate. The dynamics of entrapped gas are of global interest because the loss of this gas to the atmosphere via ebullition (bubbling) is likely the dominant transport mechanism of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere from peatlands, which are the largest natural terrestrial source per annum of atmospheric CH4. We investigated the relationship between atmospheric pressure and temperature on volumetric gas content (VGC) and CH4 ebullition using a laboratory peat core incubation experiment.
   Peat cores were incubated at three temperatures (one core at 4 degrees C, three cores at 11 degrees C, and one core at 20 degrees C in sealed PVC cylinders, instrumented to measure VGC, pore-water CH4 concentrations, and ebullition (volume and CH4 concentrations). Ebullition events primarily occurred (71% of the time) during periods of falling atmospheric pressure. The duration of the drop in atmospheric pressure had a larger control on ebullition volume than the magnitude of the drop. VGC in the 20 degrees C core increased from the onset of the experiment and reached a fluctuating but time-averaged constant level between experiment day 30 and 115. The chance in VGC was low for the 11 degrees C cores for the initial period of the experiment but showed large increases when the growth chamber temperature increased to 20 degrees C due to a malfunction. The core maintained at 4 degrees C showed only a small increase in entrapped gas content throughout the experiment. The 20 degrees C core showed the largest increase in VGC. The increases in VGC occurred despite pore-water concentrations of CH4 being below the equilibrium solubility level. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Non-perennial streams comprise over half of the global stream network and impact downstream water quality. Although aridity is a primary driver of stream drying globally, surface flow permanence varies spatially and temporally within many headwater streams, suggesting that these complex drying patterns may be driven by topographic and subsurface factors. Indeed, these factors affect shallow groundwater flows in perennial systems, but there has been only limited characterisation of shallow groundwater residence times and groundwater contributions to intermittent streams. Here, we asked how groundwater residence times, shallow groundwater contributions to streamflow, and topography interact to control stream drying in headwater streams. We evaluated this overarching question in eight semi-arid headwater catchments based on surface flow observations during the low-flow period, coupled with tracer-based groundwater residence times. For one headwater catchment, we analysed stream drying during the seasonal flow recession and rewetting period using a sensor network that was interspersed between groundwater monitoring locations, and linked drying patterns to groundwater inputs and topography. We found a poor relationship between groundwater residence times and flowing network extent (R-2 < 0.24). Although groundwater residence times indicated that old groundwater was present in all headwater streams, surface drying also occurred in each of them, suggesting old, deep flowpaths are insufficient to sustain surface flows. Indeed, the timing of stream drying at any given point typically coincided with a decrease in the contribution from near-surface sources and an increased relative contribution of groundwater to streamflow at that location, whereas the spatial pattern of drying within the stream network typically correlated with locations where groundwater inputs were most seasonally variable. Topographic metrics only explained similar to 30% of the variability in seasonal flow permanence, and surprisingly, we found no correlation with seasonal drying and down-valley subsurface storage area. Because we found complex spatial patterns, future studies should pair dense spatial observations of subsurface properties, such as hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity, to observations of seasonal flow permanence.

AB Surface soil moisture has been extensively studied for various land uses and landforms. Although many studies have reported potential factors that control surface soil moisture over space or time, the findings have not always been consistent, indicating a need for identification of the main factors. This study focused on the static controls of topographic, soil, and vegetation features on surface soil moisture in a steep natural forested headwater catchment consisting of three hillslope units of a gully area, side slope, and valley-head slope. Using a simple correlation analysis to investigate the effects of the static factors on surface soil moisture at depths of 0-20cm at 470 points in 13 surveys, we addressed the characteristics of surface soil moisture and its main controlling factors. The results indicated that the mean of surface soil moisture was in the decreasing order of gully area>valley-head slope>side slope. The relationship between the mean and standard deviation of surface soil moisture showed a convex-upward shape in the headwater catchment, a negative curvilinear shape in the gully area, and positive curvilinear shapes at the side and valley-head slopes. At the headwater catchment and valley-head slope, positive contributions of soil porosity and negative contributions of slope gradient and saturated hydraulic conductivity were the main controlling factors of surface soil moisture under wetter conditions, whereas positive contributions of topographic wetness index and negative contributions of vegetation density were the main controlling factors of surface soil moisture under drier conditions. At the side slope underlain by fractured bedrocks, only saturated hydraulic conductivity and vegetation density were observed to be the controlling factors. Surface soil moisture in the gully area was mainly affected by runoff rather than were static features. Thus, using hillslope units is effective for approximately estimating the hydrological behaviours of surface moisture on a larger scale, whereas dependency between the main static factors and moisture conditions is helpful for estimating the spatial distributions of surface moisture on a smaller scale.

AB Conservation management for the water dependent desert-oasis ecotone in arid northwest China requires information on the water use of the dominant species. However, no studies have quantified their combined water use or linked species composition to ecotone transpiration. Here, the water use of three dominant shelterbelt shrubs (Haloxylon ammodendron, Nitraria tangutorum, and Calligonum mongolicum) within an ecotone was measured throughout the full leaf-out period for three shrub species from 30 May to 16 October 2014, with sap flow gauges using the stem heat balance approach. Species-specific transpiration was estimated by scaling up sap flow velocities measured in individual stems, to stand area level, using the frequency distribution of stem diameter and assuming a constant proportionality between sap flow velocity and basal crosssectional area for all stems. The mean peak sap flux densities (J(sn)) for H. ammodendron, N. tangutorum, and C. mongolicum, were 40.12 g cm(-2) h(-1), 71.33 g cm(-2) h(-1), and 60.34 g cm(-2) h(-1), respectively, and the mean estimated daily area-averaged transpiration rates (T-daily) for the same species were 0.56 mm day(-1), 0.34 mm day(-1), and 0.11 mm day(-1). The accumulative stand transpiration was approximately 140.8mm throughout the measurement period, exceeding precipitation by as much as 42.1 mm. Furthermore, T-daily of these shrubs appeared to be much less sensitive to soil moisture as compared to atmospheric drivers, and the relationship between J(sn) and atmospheric drivers was likely uninfluenced by soil moisture regimes in the whole profile (to 1-m depth), especially for H. ammodendron and C. mongolicum. Results indicate that these shrubs may use deep soil water recharged by capillary rise, or may directly access shallow groundwater. This study provides quantitative data offering important implications for ecotone conservation and water and land resource management. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB On patterned peatlands, open water pools develop within a matrix of terrestrial vegetation ('ridges'). Regional patterns in the distribution of ridge-pool complexes suggest that the relative cover of these two surface types is controlled in part by climate wetness, but landscape topography must also be an important controlling factor. In this paper, a functional model that relates relative cover of ridges and pools to climate and surface gradient was developed and tested. The model was formulated in terms of a water budget, based on the differential effects of ridges and pools on losses by evapotranspiration and subsurface flow. It predicts a positive relationship between surface gradient and ridge proportion, with a linear effect related to water supply and ridge hydraulic conductivity, modified at high ridge proportion by differences in evapotranspiration between ridges and pools. The limit to patterned peatland distribution occurs where the surface is completely covered by ridges. The model may be sensitive or insensitive to climate differences between localities, depending on whether hydraulic characteristics of ridge peat co-vary with water supply. To distinguish between these alternative hypotheses, surface gradient and ridge proportion were surveyed along 20 transects in each of three localities in Scotland that differ threefold in net precipitation to pools. The results of the field survey served to reject the climate-sensitive hypothesis, but were consistent with the climate-insensitive hypothesis. Analysis of the residuals suggested that variation within localities was related more to topographic control of water supply than to ridge hydraulic conductivity or developmental stage. Hence, within this maritime climate region, the distribution of ridge-pool complexes and the relative abundance of pools are controlled mainly by topographic variables. Field surveys across both maritime and continental regions are required to confirm a subtle climatic effect that allows pools to occur on higher gradients in drier climates than in wetter climates. Further development and testing of the functional model will provide a stronger basis for assessing potential feedback between climate change, peatland surface structure and methane emission from pools.

AB Estimates of greenhouse gas evasion from rivers have been refined over the past decades to constrain their role in global carbon cycle processes. However, despite 55% of the human population living in urban areas, urban rivers have had limited attention. We monitored carbon dynamics in an urbanized river (River Kelvin, 331 km(2), UK) to explore the drivers of dissolved carbon lateral and vertical export. Over a 2-year sampling period, riverine methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations were consistently oversaturated with respect to atmospheric equilibria, leading to continual degassing to the atmosphere. Carbon stable isotopic compositions (delta C-13) indicated that terrestrially derived carbon comprised most of the riverine CH4 and dissolved CO2 (CO2*) load while dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from groundwater was the main form of riverine DIC. The dynamics of CH4, CO2*, and DIC in the river were primarily hydrology-controlled, that is, [CH4] and [CO2*] both increased with elevated discharge, total [DIC] decreased with elevated discharge while the proportion of biologically derived DIC increased with increasing discharge. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) showed a weak relationship with river hydrology in summer and autumn and was likely influenced by the combined sewer overflows. Carbon emission to the atmosphere is estimated to be 3.10 +/- 0.61 kg C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) normalized to water surface area, with more than 99% emitted as CO2. Annual carbon loss to the coastal estuary is approximately 4.69 +/- 0.70 Gg C yr(-1), with annual DIC export approximately double that of DOC. Per unit area, the River Kelvin was a smaller carbon source to the atmosphere than natural rivers/streams but shows elevated fluxes of DIC and DOC under comparable conditions. This research illustrates the role urban systems may have on riverine carbon dynamics and demonstrates the potential tight link between urbanization and riverine carbon export.

AB Rainfall and its consequences are usually considered as the major factor triggering slope instabilities within clay deposits. The link between rainfall, water infiltration and landslide activity may be complex, and comprehensive sets of data are still necessary to understand how water infiltrates in cohesive material. On unstable slopes made of fine-grained sediments, gravitational deformation generates superficial shear ruptures and tension fissures whose continuous opening could be amplified by shrinkage during dry periods. This fissure network at the surface can be very dense and strongly controls the water infiltration process. However, it remains difficult to assess the fissure evolution at depth and its eventual relationship with shallow slip surfaces. This work presents the results of a geophysical study which aimed to characterize the fissures that are observed along the unstable clay slopes of the Trieves area (French Alps). The site was first investigated combining geomorphological analysis, drilling, borehole logging, geotechnical tests and geophysical experiments. This investigation evidenced the presence of at least three rupture surfaces (at 5, 1015 and 42 m) with a water flow at the second one. In a second step, permanent instruments were installed (piezometers and soil water content probes). Results indicate high water infiltration velocities, down to the water table located at 2.5 m depth, that are likely to be linked with sub-vertical preferential paths, such as fissures. Geophysical parameters (electrical resistivity, S-wave velocities and Rayleigh waves attenuation) were monitored. Geophysical results suggest that fissures are permanently open, that they serve as preferential infiltration paths, and that they can reach, at least, a depth of 2 m. The methods employed in this research put forward that the system of imbricated fissures drains water from the surface down to the shallow slip surfaces at 5 and 1015 m. This work highlights the role of fissures network in water infiltration in the numerous clay landslides of the Trieves area. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Small streams with catchment areas <2 km(2) make up the majority of all stream length and are of great ecological importance. Surveys of first and second order streams reveal great spatial and temporal variability in the water chemistry of these headwaters, but their assessment presents a serious challenge since systematic, representative data are usually only collected in larger streams and rivers. Using low flow synoptic survey data from seven mesoscale Swedish catchments, this study tests the hypothesis that downstream monitoring data can be used to predict key features of the distribution of chemistry in headwater streams [median and interquartile range (IQR)]. Three ecologically relevant analytes were tested: pH, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and total organic carbon (TOC). For all seven catchments, the outlets (36-127 km(2)) were considerably less acid with lower TOC than the median of the headwaters (<2 km(2), N = 19-45). Among catchments, headwater median and IQR were positively correlated with the value at the outlet, for all three analytes. A univariate general linear model (GLM) was used to predict the headwater chemistry distribution for each catchment from its outlet chemistry, using the relationship established with the other six catchments. Headwater median pH and IQR of ANC were well predicted by a single downstream sample [median adj. R-2 similar to 0.7, normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) <0.7]. Other response variables were not as well predicted, with median adj. R-2 ranging from 0.08 to 0.48, and NRMSE up to 1.1. A minority of models were significant at alpha = 0.05, in part due to the limited availability of catchments with such extensive survey data. However, the clear trends observed suggest that with additional model development, downstream chemistry could ultimately provide a valuable tool for characterizing the range of chemistry in the contributing headwaters.

AB Key to evaluating the consequences of woody plant encroachment on water and carbon cycling in semiarid ecosystems is a mechanistic understanding of how biological and non-biological processes influence water loss to the atmosphere. To better understand how precipitation is partitioned into the components of evapotranspiration (bare-soil evaporation and plant transpiration) and their relationship to plant uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as ecosystem respiratory efflux, we measured whole plant transpiration, evapotranspiration, and CO2 fluxes over the course of a growing season at a semiarid Chihuahuan Desert shrubland site in south-eastern Arizona. Whole plant transpiration was measured using the heat balance sap-flow method, while evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) Of CO2 were quantified using the Bowen ratio technique.
   Before the summer rainy season began, all water and CO2 fluxes were small. At the onset of the rainy season, evapotranspiration was dominated by evaporation and CO2 fluxes were dominated by respiration as it took approximately 10 days for the shrubs to respond to the higher soil moisture content. During the growing season, periods immediately following rain events (<2 days) were dominated by evaporation and respiration while transpiration and CO2 uptake peaked during the interstorm periods. The surface of the coarse, well-drained soils dried quickly, rapidly reducing evaporation. Overall, the ratio of total transpiration to evapotranspiration was 58%, but it was around 70% during the months when the plants were active. Peak respiration responses following rain events generally lagged after the evaporation peak by a couple of days and were better correlated with transpiration. Transpiration and CO2 uptake also decayed rather quickly during interstorm periods, indicating that optimal plant soil moisture conditions were rarely encountered. NEE Of CO2 was increasingly more negative as the growing season progressed, indicating a greater net uptake Of CO2 and greater water use efficiency due mainly to decreases in respiration.

AB This contribution presents a study of discharge variability at two karst springs outlet in southwestern France and aims at presenting the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), which method is not very usual in hydrology, to the community interested in investigating the scaling behavior of karst hydrological responses. Several studies have already highlighted the existence of a power law scaling behavior in the spectral variance distribution of hydrological signals such as rainfall rates, stream flow and groundwater levels. This power law behavior provides evidence for characteristic scales that correspond to different physical responses of the system depending on its complexity and occurring at distinct temporal scales. We derive in this contribution particular scaling behavior of karstic watersheds, in particular, the assessment of time interval of karstic watershed responses to rainfall. Based on DFA analysis and relying on a unique high resolution long-term discharge database, we provide evidence for a scaling behavior in the response of two French karstic watersheds. The DFA analysis of discharge time series fluctuations at daily, half hourly and 3-min sampling rate allows to detect scaling behavior in the fluctuation of karstic stream flow from 1 h up to 100-h, from 100-h up to 1-year time scales and for scales larger than I year. The DFA analysis can also be useful in investigating groundwater levels or chemical conductance time series scaling behavior and deserves to be more largely disseminated in hydrology as valuable complement to Fourier or wavelet analyses.

AB The advance of a chemical weathering front into the bedrock of a hillslope is often limited by the rate weathering products that can be carried away, maintaining chemical disequilibrium. If the weathering front is within the saturated zone, groundwater flow downslope may affect the rate of transport and weathering-however, weathering also modifies the rock permeability and the subsurface potential gradient that drives lateral groundwater flow. This feedback may help explain why there tends to be neither "runaway weathering" to great depth nor exposed bedrock covering much of the earth and may provide a mechanism for weathering front advance to keep pace with incision of adjacent streams into bedrock. This is the second of a two-part paper exploring the coevolution of bedrock weathering and lateral flow in hillslopes using a simple low-dimensional model based on hydraulic groundwater theory. Here, we show how a simplified kinetic model of 1-D rock weathering can be extended to consider lateral flow in a 2-D hillslope. Exact and approximate analytical solutions for the location and thickness of weathering within the hillslope are obtained for a number of cases. A location for the weathering front can be found such that lateral flow is able to export weathering products at the rate required to keep pace with stream incision at steady state. Three pathways of solute export are identified: "diffusing up," where solutes diffuse up and away from the weathering front into the laterally flowing aquifer; "draining down," where solutes are advected primarily downward into the unweathered bedrock; and "draining along," where solutes travel laterally within the weathering zone. For each pathway, a different subsurface topography and overall relief of unweathered bedrock within the hillslope is needed to remove solutes at steady state. The relief each pathway requires depends on the rate of stream incision raised to a different power, such that at a given incision rate, one pathway requires minimal relief and, therefore, likely determines the steady-state hillslope profile.

AB The Everglades has been experiencing major changes, both natural and anthropogenic, such that the landscape is deviating away from its natural equilibrium. The land within the Everglades has undergone severe modifications that may have detrimental effects on wildlife and natural features, such as rivers and landscape connectivity. Here in this study, we focus on understanding and quantifying hydrologic and geomorphic signatures of climatic and anthropogenic changes on the Everglades landscape. For this, in particular, we use available data on natural hydrological processes, such as rainfall, groundwater elevation, streamflow as well as surface elevations and satellite images for three different regions. These regions are categorized as forested, urban (nearby Everglades regions) and transition (in between forested and urban regions). Our results show distinct differences in the statistics of observed hydrologic variables for the three different regions. For example, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of groundwater elevation for the case of urban region show a shift in mean as well as lower asymmetry as compared to forested regions. In addition, a significant difference in the slopes between smaller and larger scales of the power spectral densities (PSDs) is observed when transitioning from forested to urban. For the case of the streamflow PDFs and PSDs, we observe the opposite trends. Finally, computing the interarrival times of extreme (>95th percentile) events that suggest power-law behavior, the changes in power-law exponents of the hydrologic processes further highlights how these processes differ spatially and how the landscape has to respond to these changes. Quantifying these observed changes will help us develop a better understanding of the Everglades and other wetlands ecosystems for management to future changes and restoration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fluid transport across the natural tight micro-nanometer porous media governs numerous subsurface geological and industrial activities. The unsteady-state two-phase fluid flow at the very initial stage of non-wetting phase fluid intrusion, governing the hydrocarbon accumulation and CO2 geological sequestration process, remains uncertain. A modified unsteady-state pressurization gas displacement experiment incorporating systematic pore structure description combining mercury porosimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray computed tomography is conducted on the tight sandstone cores to investigate the fluid flow behaviors and to uncover their pore-scale controls. The results indicate that the unsteady-state gas-water flow deviates from Darcy's law, in which the threshold for the onset of continuous non-wetting phase fluid intrusion (ISTP) can be observed and degree of water movement and gas intrusion strongly depend on the injection pressure. Analyses under circular pore assumption, water layer distribution model based on DLVO theory, effective flow assumption, and overall pore connectivity evaluation suggest that the water movement and gas accessibility increases are dominated by the water displacement in the free water layer zone when injection pressure < ISTP, while the criticality of continuous gas intrusion is determined by the water movement in the inner layer of weakly bound water zone located in the narrow parts of the connected pathways, especially that in the pores < 40 nm, but its increment mainly occurs in the out layer of the weakly bound water zone when injection pressure > ISTP. Distinctions in the distributions and proportions of free and bound water layers in the different connected pore systems lead to the significant variations in the ISTP, water mobility, and gas accessibility of tight sandstone. The primary reasons for the differences in the static fluid mobility and flow behaviors lay in the differed structural attributes of connected pore systems. The narrowing, heterogeneity increase, and actual flow length increment of the connected pathways will raise the resistance for continuous non-wetting phase flow and lead to losses in water mobility, accessibility of non-wetting phase fluid, and flow velocity in the unsteady-state two-phase fluid flow. The high sensitivity of the dynamic fluid flow and gas accessibility to tortuosity of the connected pore system suggests the unsteady-state two-phase fluid flow behaviors are under the coupled control of pore size, complexity, and heterogeneity.

AB Precipitation is a major component of the hydrologic cycle in arid desert areas. To date, however, few studies have been conducted on investigating the isotope characteristics and moisture sources of precipitation in arid desert environments. The Alxa Desert Plateau is a critical arid desert area in North China. This study is the first to analyse the stable isotopic composition of precipitation to identify the sources of atmospheric moisture over this plateau. Our results show that the D and O-18 values of precipitation across the plateau change greatly at both daily and monthly timescales, and exhibit seasonal variations. Among the main meteorological parameters, atmospheric temperature is the most predominant factor controlling the isotopic composition and the D-O-18 relationship of local precipitation. Analyses of the precipitation isotopes with the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model reveal that (a) the westerly and polar moisture sources are the dominant controls on summer and winter precipitation and (b) the evaporation of local lake water significantly affects winter precipitation even though it only represents a small amount. Based on the isotope data of 2013-2016 precipitation, a local meteoric water line (LMWL) is derived: D=(8.20 +/- 0.22)O-18+(8.15 +/- 2.16)parts per thousand for the study site. Compared to the global meteoric water line, the LMWL has a greater slope and lower d-excess. This can be explained by admixing of atmospheric moisture resulting from the evaporation of local lake water. Based on this LMWL, we are able to trace that groundwater of the Badain Jaran Desert originates from the surrounding mountains with altitudes of <4,000m. The newly derived LMWL shows that the recharge altitudes of desert groundwater are overestimated on the basis of the previous LMWLs. This study not only provides insights into the hydrological cycle but also offers guidance for water resource management in arid desert areas of China. Additionally, this study provides techniques that can be applied to the analyses of precipitation isotopes in similar arid regions of the world.

AB Despite uncertainties and errors in measurement, observed peak discharges are the best estimate of the true peak discharge from a catchment. However, in ungauged catchments, the catchment response time is a fundamental input to all methods of estimating peak discharges; hence, errors in estimated catchment response time directly impact on estimated peak discharges. In South Africa, this is particularly the case in ungauged medium to large catchments where practitioners are limited to use empirical methods that were calibrated on small catchments not located in South Africa. The time to peak (T-P), time of concentration (T-C) and lag time (T-L) are internationally the most frequently used catchment response time parameters and are normally estimated using either hydraulic or empirical methods. Almost 95% of all the time parameter estimation methods developed internationally are empirically based. This paper presents the derivation and verification of empirical T-P equations in a pilot scale study using 74 catchments located in four climatologically different regions of South Africa, with catchment areas ranging from 20km(2) to 35 000km(2). The objective is to develop unique relationships between observed T-P values and key climatological and geomorphological catchment predictor variables in order to estimate catchment T-P values at ungauged catchments. The results show that the derived empirical T-P equation(s) meet the requirement of consistency and ease of application. Independent verification tests confirmed the consistency, while the statistically significant independent predictor variables included in the regressions provide a good estimation of catchment response times and are also easy to determine by practitioners when required for future applications in ungauged catchments. It is recommended that the methodology used in this study should be expanded to other catchments to enable the development of a regional approach to improve estimation of time parameters on a national-scale. However, such a national-scale application would not only increase the confidence in using the suggested methodology and equation(s) in South Africa, but also highlights that a similar approach could be adopted internationally.

AB Water samples from the Yamuna and its tributaries, one of the major river systems draining the Himalaya, have been analysed for their stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes during three seasons (summer, monsoon and post-monsoon). The data show clear seasonal and altitudinal variations; waters from higher altitudes and those collected during monsoon season are characterized by relatively depleted isotopic composition. Regression analysis of deltaD-delta(18)O data of samples collected during summer and monsoon seasons shows that the slope of the best-fit lines are nearly identical to those of precipitation at New Delhi for the same period. The similarity in their slopes suggests that the isotopic composition of precipitation contributing water to these rivers are reasonably well preserved in both monsoon and non-monsoon seasons, however, during the non-monsoon period both rainfall and river waters carry signatures of evaporation. The 'deuterium excess' in river waters during the three seasons though overlap with each other, the values during October are higher. This can be understood in terms of recycled moisture contributions to precipitation. The 'altitude effect' for delta(18)O in these waters is determined to be 0.11parts per thousand per 100 m, a factor of about two less than that reported for the Ganga source waters from similar altitudinal range. The variability in altitude effects in rivers draining the Himalaya seems to be controlled by the 'amount effect' associated with the monsoon. The significant spatial variability in altitude effect in these river basins, which are a few hundred kilometers apart, suggests that reconstruction of palaeoelevation in the Himalaya, based on delta(18)O-altitude gradients, would depend critically on its proper assessment in the region. This study has established a relationship between total cation abundance and delta(18)O in waters of the Yamuna mainstream; total cations (corrected for cyclic components) double for a 1.4 km decrease in altitude as the Yamuna flows downstream.

AB An approach for nonstationary low-flow frequency analysis is developed and demonstrated on a dataset from the rivers on the Loess Plateau of China. Nonstationary low-flow frequency analysis has drawn significant attention in recent years by establishing relationships between low-flow series and explanatory variables series, but few studies have tested whether the time-varying moments of low flow can be fully described by the time-varying moments of the explanatory variables. In this research, the low-flow distributions are analytically derived from the 2 basic explanatory variablesthe recession duration and the recession coefficientwith the assumption that the recession duration and recession coefficient variables follow exponential and gamma distributions, respectively; the derived low-flow distributions are applied to test whether the time-varying moments of explanatory variables can explain the nonstationarities found in the low-flow variable. The effects of ecosystem construction measures, that is, check dam, terrace, forest, and grassland, on the recession duration and recession coefficient are further discussed. Daily flow series from 11 hydrological stations from the Loess Plateau are used and processed with a moving average technique. Low-flow data are extracted following the pit under threshold approach. Six of the 11 low-flow series show significant nonstationarities at the 5% significance level, and the trend curves of the moments of low flow are in close agreement with the curves estimated from the derived distribution with time-dependent moments of the recession duration and time-constant moments of the recession coefficient. It is indicated that the nonstationarity in the low-flow distribution results from the nonstationarity in the recession duration in all 6 cases, and the increase in the recession duration is resulted from large-scale ecosystem constructions rather than climate change. The large-scale ecosystem constructions are found to have more influence on the decrease in streamflow than on the increase in watershed storage, thus resulting in the reduction of low flow. A high return period for the initial fixed design value decreases dramatically with an increasing recession duration.

AB Characterizing active and water-conducting porosity in organic soils in both saturated and unsaturated zones is required for models of water and solute transport. There is a limitation, largely due to lack of data, on the hydraulic properties of unsaturated organic soils in permafrost regions, and in particular, the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and pressure head. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to what fraction of the matrix and what pores conduct water at different pressure heads, as closed and dead-end pores are common features in organic soil. The objectives of this study were to determine the water-conducting porosity of organic soils for different pore radii ranges using the method proposed by Bodhinayake et al. (2004) [Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 68:760-769] and compare these values to active pore size distributions from resin-impregnated laboratory thin sections and pressure plate analysis. Field experiments and soil samples were completed in the Wolf Creek Research Basin, Yukon. Water infiltration rates were measured 16 times using a tension infiltrometer (TI) at 5 different pressure heads from -150 to 0 mm. This data was combined with Gardiner's (1958) exponential unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function to provide water-conducting porosity for different pore-size ranges. Total water-conducting porosity was 1.1 x 10(4) which accounted for only 0.01% of the total soil volume. Active pore areas obtained from 2-D image analysis ranged from 0.45 to 0.60, declining with depth. Macropores accounted for approximately 65% of the water flux at saturation, yet all methods suggest macropores account for only a small fraction of the total porosity. Results among the methods are highly equivocal, and more research is required to reconcile field and laboratory methods of pore and hydraulic characteristics. However, this information is of significant value as organic soils in permafrost regions are poorly characterized in the literature. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Soil is a critical intermediary of water flux between precipitation and stream flow. Characterization of soil water content (theta, m(3) m(-3)) may be especially difficult in mountainous, snow-dominated catchments due to highly variable water inputs, topography, soils and vegetation. However, individual sites exhibit similar seasonal dynamics, suggesting that it may be possible to describe spatial variability in terms of temporally stable relationships. Working in a 0.36 km(2) headwater catchment, we: (i) described and the spatial variability of theta over a 2 year period, (ii) characterized that variability in terms of temporal stability analysis, and (iii) related changes in temporally stable soil water patterns to stream flow generation. Soil water data were collected for 2 years at representative sites and quantified in terms of theta and water storage to a depth of 75 cm (S-75, cm). Both S-75 and theta were normally distributed in space on all measurement dates. Spatial variability was high relative to other studies, reflecting catchment heterogeneity. However, the ranking Of S-75 values displayed temporal stability for all site locations, seasonally and annually. This stability was attributed to soil texture. Further temporal analysis indicated that estimates of catchment mean and standard deviation of S-75 may be characterized with relatively few measurements. Finally, we used temporal linear regression to define catchment soil water conditions related to stream-flow generation. Static, high S-75 conditions in late winter and early spring indicate that stream-flow response is highly sensitive to inputs, whereas static, low S-75 conditions in late summer and early fall indicate minimum stream-flow sensitivity to water inputs. The fall transition was marked by uniform Sd across the catchment. The late spring transition was marked by nonuniform S-75 decreases, with the highest S-75 sites decreasing most. Threshold S-75 values identifying catchment sensitivity to water input were identified. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB In urban rivers, flow regime and channel morphology are the drivers of physical habitat quality for aquatic species. Peak discharges are increased at high flows as a result of impermeable catchments and channel engineering for flood protection schemes. Hazardous conditions and flashy hydrographs mean that measurement of velocities at high flows is a difficult task. This research uses a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3D-CFD) model to simulate hydraulic patterns in two urban river channels. A 3D-CFD code, called SSIIM, was used to simulate hydraulic conditions in two engineered river reaches of the River Tame, Birmingham, UK. These two sites represent channels with different levels of engineering. Models were calibrated and tested using field measurements. Results show that modelled water surface levels and velocity profiles are well simulated. Calibrated roughness heights are compared with those derived from field measurement of sediment size. Numerical experiments are used to assess the relationship between grid resolution in the vertical dimension and the form of the modelled velocity profiles. Biologists have used laboratory experiments to determine maximum sustainable swimming speeds (MSSS) of fish, often in order to assess what level of a particular pollutant may be tolerable. In this work, simulations of high-flow hydraulic patterns are used to compare velocity patterns with fish MSSS. Results show that when the water levels rise to fill the, first channel of the two-stage channels at the sites, which occurred 16 times in 2000, MSSS are surpassed in the majority of available habitat, suggesting that excessive velocities at high flows are one factor that limits fish habitat. A comparison between the two reaches shows that there is less available habitat in the more modified reach. Conclusions suggest that an approach that integrates water quality issues and physical channel characteristics must be taken in river rehabilitation schemes, as improvements to water quality alone may not be sufficient to improve habitat quality to the desired level.

AB Porous media whose grain sizes are distributed according to the law proposed by Turcotte (1986, J. Geophys. Res., 91(B2): 1921-1926) are investigated in order to check if the void volume is a fractal object. It is shown that a power-law distribution of the particle sizes implies a scaling structure of the voids only within a given range of values of the porosity and of the distribution exponent.

ID ENERGY-BALANCE CLOSURE
AB Conventionally, the Bowen ratio method and eddy covariance are used to measure evapotranspiration (ET); however, they have limited accuracy. Inverse analysis (IA), a novel method presented here, can estimate evapotranspiration (ETa) using commonly measured climatic variables. However, because actual ET data are limited, the accuracy of IA remains uncertain. Recently, IA accuracy has been improved, thus, observed latent heat flux (lEobs) in FLUXNET2015 data, a global dataset, and estimated values can be compared. Herein, we aim to evaluate the accuracy of the IA method. Eight forest sites in the dataset during 2000-2014 were selected as test sites, and hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly comparisons of lEobs and ETa were conducted using regression analysis and root mean square error (RMSE) calculations. The results are as follows: (sic) Comparison of lEobs-hourly and ETa for all sites showed a similar pattern, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0053 mm h(-1). (sic) Comparison of lEobs-daily and ETa showed high correlation coefficients, with slopes ranging from 1.016-0.717 and an average RMSE of 1.08 mm h(-1). (sic)Comparison of lEobs-monthly and ETa showed similar patterns, with slopes ranging from 1.042-0.811 and an average RMSE of 17.9 mm m(-1). (sic) The slope of lEobs-yearly and ETa was 0.988 and the average RMSE was 71.0 mm year(-1). (sic) The average of lEobs-yearly and ETa showed a strong relationship, with a slope of 0.992. (sic) The differences between the time steps of lEobs and ETa were evaluated qualitatively using RMSE/lEobs-yearly, with hourly-yearly differences of 8.4%, 70.2%, 40.4%, and 14.2%, respectively. The above results indicate that IA can be used for an accurate estimation of ET. The findings of this study contribute significantly to water management and a deeper understanding of the hydrologic cycle.

AB Sediment delivery following post-fire logging is a concern relative to water quality. While studies have assessed the effect of post-fire logging on sediment yields at different spatial scales, none have explicitly identified sediment sources. Our goal was to quantify post-fire and post-salvage logging sediment yields and use rill patterns to identify sediment sources. We measured the extent and type of logging disturbance, length of rills per unit area or "rill density", ground cover, and sediment yields in nine logged and five control small catchments or "swales", 0.09 to 0.81 ha, for 5 years after the 2013 Rim Fire in California's Sierra Nevada. The logged swales had a mean ground disturbance of 31%. After the first wet season following logging, there was no difference in either mean rill density (0.071 and 0.088 m m(-2), respectively) or mean transformed, normalized sediment yields between the control and logged swales. Untransformed mean sediment yields across three sites ranged from 0.11-11.8 and 1.1-3.2 Mg ha(-1) for the controls and salvage-logged swales, respectively. Rill density was strongly related to sediment yield and increased significantly with the amount of high-traffic skid trail disturbance in logged swales. Rill density was not significantly related to the amount of bare soil despite a significant relationship between sediment yields and bare soil. Rills usually initiated in bare soil and frequently connected high traffic skid trails to the drainage network after being diverted by waterbars. Rill connectivity and sediment yields decreased in control and logged swales where vegetation or other surface cover was high, suggesting this cover disconnected rills from the drainage network. Increasing ground cover on skid trails and between areas disturbed by post-fire logging and stream channels may reduce sediment yields as well as the hydrologic connectivity between hillslopes and the drainage network.

AB Uncertainty communication is an important topic within hydrological forecasting. Hydrological ensemble prediction systems are established tools for the generation of forecasts including uncertainty information. The interpretation of such forecasts requires new visualization and verification tools to help forecasters and end-users in their decision making. While the visualization of hydrographs is important for estimating flood volumes, little support is provided for the interpretation of peak-flow forecasts. We introduce the 'Peak-Box', a novel visual support that envelops all ensemble peak timings and peak discharge, from which specific verification metrics are defined. A user-defined metric quantifies the sharpness concerning peak timing and peak discharge and allows communicating a-priori, if the spread of peak forecasts is acceptable.
   Eighteen months of ensemble predictions for four basins have been evaluated. A probabilistic verification which relies on the relationships between the spread and the relative operating characteristic area indicates the quality of the ensemble predictions in all basins. A sub-sample of 485 events was used for exploring the value of the 'Peak-Box'. The combined spread of forecast peak time and peak discharge is higher than a tailored reference sharpness for most of the considered events. We show that, depending on the lead time of the forecasts, 30% to 55% of the observed peaks are found outside the predicted range. Most correct forecasts (hits) were obtained for forecasts having a lead time of 2 or more days. Further analyses indicate that the median of the ensemble peak forecast provides reliable estimates on either peak timing or peak discharge in more than 80% of the events evaluated. Finally, a score system was defined in order to combine different verification measures and obtain an overall assessment on the quality of both the peak discharge and peak -timing of the ensemble forecasts.
   We demonstrate that the 'Peak-Box' can be adopted in different ways in order to obtain quantitative and qualitative insights on the quality of peak forecasts. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB First-order streams are rarely the focus of research even though they play an important hydrological and ecological role in upland landscapes and may be more susceptible to human impacts than larger streams. We studied 16 first-order streams in the North Carolina Piedmont to examine relationships between land use, discharge, flashiness and conductivity in the headwaters of the Rocky River and McDowell Creek. Stream gauges were installed on each of the 16 headwater streams to provide constant monitoring of stream depth, temperature and specific conductance. Rating curves were created for each site using models that combined field measured and Manning's calculated discharge. Initial attempts to measure flashiness using the Richards-Baker Index (RBI) indicated that it is not a good proxy for flashiness in small streams because its use of median daily flows do not capture fluctuations that occur over short time periods. Instead, we developed a new method that focused on the number of days each stream flows above its 99th percentile flow (DMQ99). We also examined individual storm events across multiple seasons. We found that headwater streams in the Piedmont are flashier than more commonly gauged second and third order streams because first-order streams are more directly connected to the landscape. Streams located in suburban areas tend to be flashier than streams in forested areas as a result of the increase in impervious surfaces and the reduction of evapotranspiration (ET) caused by development. Additionally, we found that all streams become flashier in the winter when ET is lower, suggesting important feedbacks between physical and biological systems. All streams experience periodic extreme conductivity events, indicating significantly impaired ecological conditions. More developed basins generally have higher maximum specific conductance compared with less developed basins although streams have significant natural variability as well. Overall, our results indicate that first-order streams in the Piedmont are highly impacted by development and that extra caution should be exercised when altering landscapes near small streams.

AB Water temperature is a key driver for riverine biota and strongly depends on shading by woody riparian vegetation in summer. While the general effects of shading on daily maximum water temperature T-max are well understood, knowledge gaps on the role of the spatial configuration still exist. In this study, the effect of riparian buffer length, width, and canopy cover (percentage of buffer area covered by woody vegetation) on T-max was investigated during summer baseflow using data measured in seven small lowland streams in western Germany (wetted width 0.8-3.7 m). The effect of buffer length on T-max differed between downstream cooling and heating: T-max approached cooler equilibrium conditions after a distance of 0.4 km (similar to 45 min travel-time) downstream of a sharp increase in canopy cover. In contrast, T-max continued to rise downstream of a sharp decrease in canopy cover along the whole 1.6 km stream length investigated. The effect of woody vegetation on T-max depended on buffer width, with changes in canopy cover in a 10 m wide buffer being a better predictor for changes in T-max compared to a 30 m buffer. The effect of woody vegetation on T-max was linearly related to canopy cover but also depended on daily temperature range T-range, which itself was governed by cloudiness, upstream canopy cover, and season. The derived empirical relationship indicated that T-max was reduced by -4.6 degrees C and increased by +2.7 degrees C downstream of a change from unshaded to fully shaded conditions and vice versa. This maximum effect was predicted for a 10 m wide buffer at sunny days in early summer, in streams with large diel fluctuations (large T-range). Therefore, even narrow woody riparian buffers may substantially reduce the increase in T-max due to climate change, especially in small shallow headwater streams with low baseflow discharge and large daily temperature fluctuations.

AB The relationships between catchment characteristics, management and ecological response of receiving waters categorise risk of impact from diffuse pollution. We investigated spatiotemporal patterns in area-weighted nutrient loads and nutrient-flow relationships at 14 locations on 11 rivers in the catchment of Lough Mask in the west of Ireland. Relationships between river flow and the concentrations of a number of fractions of phosphorus and nitrogen differed significantly among the rivers, suggesting that risk is not static, but varies over short timescales and among catchments. Further, the relative magnitude of the nutrient-flow relationship was found to vary seasonally for both phosphorus and nitrogen. Nutrient concentrations during high flows in summer and autumn were significantly higher than during winter and spring, suggestive of disproportionate risk to surface water quality during summer high flow events owing to high potential growth rates of algal communities. Significant positive associations were found between extent of high productivity grasslands and urban areas with nutrient loads, slopes of nutrient-flow relationships and the most biologically available fractions of nutrients. These findings are important for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive, as defining risk to degradation of ecological quality of waters from catchment activities will drive programmes of measures. Insufficient or inappropriate risk assessment will likely inhibit or prevent effective implementation. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We explored the feasibility of an improved design of a CO2 leakage monitoring network at a geologic storage site. To effectively represent CO2 pathways, a rule-based percolation model was adopted rather than the rigorous multiphase flow model based on Darcy's equation. Five different monitoring network designs were compared using a few scenarios and multiple correlated random field realizations. The ensemble results showed that given the detection uncertainty across the entire sensor network, regular spacing deployment of sensors is the most effective method when a sufficient number of sensors is available. The results also showed that an aggressive monitoring design based on information of the spatial permeability distribution near the surface can be a viable method when a limited number of sensors is employed. However, such an aggressive design can lead to elevated uncertainty in leakage detectability.

AB A study was made of the water chemistry, tissue nutrients and surface phosphatase activities of the 2-cm apices of three mosses in four upland streams in northern England, UK. This was part of a project to optimize methods for assessing nutrient fractions in environments with highly variable water chemistry. Aqueous N and P fractions showed the greatest variability followed by moss phosphatase activities, with nutrient composition of the shoot apices the least variable. There was no consistent pattern as to which aqueous N or P fraction was the most variable. The ratio between total inorganic N and total filtrable P ranged over three orders of magnitude in some streams. The interrelations between tissue N and P concentrations, tissue N:P ratio, phosphatase activities and aqueous variables showed:
   (1) Significant +ve relationship between tissue N and aqueous NO3-N in some populations, but not between tissue P and aqueous P concentration;
   (2) Significant +ve relationships between phosphatase activities and aqueous organic N, but none with aqueous organic P;
   (3) Significant +ve relationships between phosphodiesterase:phosphomonoesterase activities and aqueous organic N;
   (4) Significant -ve relationships between phosphatase activities and tissue concentration;
   (5) Significant +ve relationships between phosphatase activities and tissue N:P.
   Both types of biological measurement are valuable for monitoring ambient nutrients in upland streams. Neither is clearly better than the other, so both should be included in surveys. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithological and hydrological influence on fluvial physical and chemical erosion was studied in a glacierized sedimentary basin with high evaporite presence. Suspended particulate matter (SPM), total dissolved solids (TDS) and major ion concentrations were analysed for 2years of different hydrologic condition: (i) 2009-2010, Q=100% average; and (ii) 2010-2011, Q=60% average. Annual hydrograph was simple regime-type with one peak in summer related to snow melting. The intra-annual SPM and TDS variations were directly and inversely associated to Q, respectively. Snow chemistry showed continental influence (Na+/Ca2+=0.17), and atmospheric input of TDS was <1% of the total exported flux. River water was highly concentrated in Ca2+ and SO42- (4mmoll(-1)) and in Na+ and Cl- (3mmoll(-1)). Ca2+/SO42- and Na+/Cl- molar ratios were 1 and related to Q, directly and inversely, respectively. Major ion relationships suggest that river chemistry is controlled by evaporite (gypsum and halite) dissolution having a summer input from sulfide oxidation and carbonate dissolution, and a winter input from subsurface flow loaded with silicate weathering products. This variation pattern resulted in nearly chemostatic behaviour for Ca+, Mg2+ and SO42-, whereas Na+, Cl- and SiO2 concentrations showed to be controlled by dilution/concentration processes. During the 2009-2010 hydrological year, the fluxes of water, SPM and TDS registered in the snow melting-high Q season were, respectively, 71%, 92% and 67% of the annual total, whereas for equal period in 2010-2011, 56% of water, 86% of SPM and 54% of TDS annual fluxes were registered. The SPM fluxes for 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 were 1.19x10(6) and 0.79x10(6)tyear(-1), whereas TDS fluxes were 0.68x10(6) and 0.55x10(6)tyear(-1), respectively. Export rates for 2009-2010 were 484tkm(2)year(-1) for SPM and 275tkm(2)year(-1) for TDS. These rates are higher than those observed in glacierized granite basins and in non-glacierized evaporite basins, suggesting a synergistic effect of lithology and glaciers on physical and chemical erosion.

AB The formation of bauxite from a granitic protolith, at 25 degrees C, has been simulated using a modified version of the 1DREACT software far one-dimensional reactive transport, which uses a kinetic approach to describe the mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions. The rate laws describing these reactions incorporate the important effects of mineral surface area, pH, and solution saturation state, and are based on experimentally determined rates published in the literature. The original program has been modified to allow for a different treatment of the mineral surface areas and reaction rate laws.
   The results of long term simulations (>1 Ma) show the development of gibbsite-rich weathering profiles (bauxites), which are underlaid by muscovite-rich zones. These muscovite-rich zones are not observed in the field (the typical 'bauxitic' profile consists of an upper gibbsite-rich and a lower kaolinite-rich zone). A strong nucleation barrier for muscovite could explain the absence of muscovite from the weathering profiles. The results also show that the infiltrating solutions get closer to saturation with respect to microcline than with respect to albite, in agreement with numerous field observations.
   The simulations also predict the formation of a 5-10 m thick gibbsite-kaolinite transition zone, which is in agreement with field observations, and argues for the applicability of the experimentally determined rates, or at least their ratios, to field conditions.
   Regarding the chemistry of the solutions leaving the weathering profiles, the Si/(Na + K) ratio of the waters increases to values higher than 3 with time (intense weathering), in agreement with some of the river chemistry data from the Guayana Shield reported by Edmond et al. (1995). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We compared median runoff (R) and precipitation (P) relationships over 25years from 20 mesoscale (50 to 5,000km(2)) catchments on the Boreal Plains, Alberta, Canada, to understand controls on water sink and source dynamics in water-limited, low-relief northern environments. Long-term catchment R and runoff efficiency (RP-1) were low and varied spatially by over an order of magnitude (3 to 119mm/year, 1 to 27%). Intercatchment differences were not associated with small variations in climate. The partitioning of P into evapotranspiration (ET) and R instead reflected the interplay between underlying glacial deposit texture, overlying soil-vegetation land cover, and regional slope. Correlation and principal component analyses results show that peatland-swamp wetlands were the major source areas of water. The lowest estimates of median annual catchment ET (321 to 395mm) and greatest R (60 to 119mm, 13 to 27% of P) were observed in low-relief, peatland-swamp dominated catchments, within both fine-textured clay-plain and coarse-textured glacial deposits. In contrast, open-water wetlands and deciduous-mixedwood forest land covers acted as water sinks, and less catchment R was observed with increases in proportional coverage of these land covers. In catchments dominated by hummocky moraines, long-term runoff was restricted to 10mm/year, or 2% of P. This reflects the poor surface-drainage networks and slightly greater regional slope of the fine-textured glacial deposit, coupled with the large soil-water and depression storage and higher actual ET of associated shallow open-water marsh wetland and deciduous-forest land covers. This intercatchment study enhances current conceptual frameworks for predicting water yield in the Boreal Plains based on the sink and source functions of glacial landforms and soil-vegetation land covers. It offers the capability within this hydro-geoclimatic region to design reclaimed catchments with desired hydrological functionality and associated tolerances to climate or land-use changes and inform land management decisions based on effective catchment-scale conceptual understanding.

AB Fluxes across the groundwater-surface water interface are spatially and temporally variable, difficult to observe and measure, and play a major role in regulating ecological habitat distributions, water quality, and water quantity. The long-term quantification of these fluxes is difficult as field conditions dictate when data can be collected. Ultimately there is a pressing necessity to quantify these long-term flow regimes, as impacts from a changing climate are altering the timing and extent of key groundwater-surface water interactions. The use of periodic temperature time series data is one method that can be utilized to capture these fluxes over long periods of time. Long term deployment of temperature sensors, continuously logging temperature time series data, can be leveraged into time-varying Darcy fluxes via time series analysis and the advection-dispersion equation. However, as hydrologic boundary conditions change, fluxes transition in both magnitude and direction and these temperature time series-based methods are less capable of accurately quantifying fluxes. Real world data taken from five existing United States Geological Survey paired stream gages and riparian groundwater wells sites were used as boundary conditions to inform a one-dimensional heat and mass transport model, with the simulated temperatures used to quantify Darcy fluxes through time. Comparing the Darcy fluxes found using Darcy's Law and the estimated Darcy fluxes from the use of heat as an environmental tracer, periodic temperature time series derived fluxes accurately matched those derived from Darcy's law at three of the sites. For the remaining two sites, hydrologic conditions resulted in erroneous flux estimates, allowing for the identification of specific conditions where temperature time series methods relying on a periodic signal cannot be applied.

AB Long-term hydrological data are key to understanding catchment behaviour and for decision making within water management and planning. Given the lack of observed data in many regions worldwide, such as Central America, hydrological models are an alternative for reproducing historical streamflow series. Additional types of informationto locally observed dischargecan be used to constrain model parameter uncertainty for ungauged catchments. Given the strong influence that climatic large-scale processes exert on streamflow variability in the Central American region, we explored the use of climate variability knowledge as process constraints to constrain the simulated discharge uncertainty for a Costa Rican catchment, assumed to be ungauged. To reduce model uncertainty, we first rejected parameter relationships that disagreed with our understanding of the system. Then, based on this reduced parameter space, we applied the climate-based process constraints at long-term, inter-annual, and intra-annual timescales. In the first step, we reduced the initial number of parameters by 52%, and then, we further reduced the number of parameters by 3% with the climate constraints. Finally, we compared the climate-based constraints with a constraint based on global maps of low-flow statistics. This latter constraint proved to be more restrictive than those based on climate variability (further reducing the number of parameters by 66% compared with 3%). Even so, the climate-based constraints rejected inconsistent model simulations that were not rejected by the low-flow statistics constraint. When taken all together, the constraints produced constrained simulation uncertainty bands, and the median simulated discharge followed the observed time series to a similar level as an optimized model. All the constraints were found useful in constraining model uncertainty for anassumed to beungauged basin. This shows that our method is promising for modelling long-term flow data for ungauged catchments on the Pacific side of Central America and that similar methods can be developed for ungauged basins in other regions where climate variability exerts a strong control on streamflow variability.

AB Reduced sampling frequency is known to increase the error associated with estimates of stream solute load. However, the extent to which the magnitude of error differs among commonly measured solutes and across seasons is unclear. In this study, a high sampling frequency data set from two forested streams (one upland-draining and one wetland-draining stream) in south-central Ontario was systematically sub-sampled to simulate weekly, fortnightly and monthly fixed frequency sampling regimes for 12 stream solutes. We found that solutes which had a higher degree of temporal variation in concentration (i.e. higher % RSD) had poorer precision (C-v) in estimates of annual load relative to solutes with a lower % RSD. In addition, the magnitude and direction of bias varied considerably among solutes and were related to differences in spring concentration-discharge relationships (m([spring) (Q) (vs) (C])) among the 12 solutes. Solutes which decreased in concentration with increases in spring flow (i.e. m([spring) (Q) (vs C]) < 0) exhibited positive bias in annual load while solutes which increased in concentration with increases in spring flow (i.e. m([spring) (Q) (vs) (C]) > 0) were negatively biased. In terms of differences between seasonal and annual load errors, precision was generally lower for estimates of seasonal load relative to annual load while bias varied in both magnitude and direction among seasons. When the root mean square error (RMSE) of load estimates was compared to a threshold of acceptable error (<15%), the proportion of solutes attaining acceptable levels of uncertainty ranged from 11/12 for annual load estimates at a weekly sampling frequency to only 4/12 at a monthly frequency when both annual and seasonal loads were considered. Our results demonstrate that commonly measured solutes do not behave uniformly in response to changes in sampling frequency and that estimates of seasonal loads are often less accurate than estimates of annual load. These findings provide important insights into the design of stream monitoring programs and the evaluation of existing long-term data sets. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Numerous studies investigated the influence of abiotic (meteorological conditions) and biotic factors (tree characteristics) on stemflow generation. Although these studies identified the variables that influence stemflow volumes in simply structured forests, the combination of tree characteristics that allows a robust prediction of stemflow volumes in species-rich forests is not well known. Many hydrological applications, however, require at least a rough estimate of stemflow volumes based on the characteristics of a forest stand. The need for robust predictions of stemflow motivated us to investigate the relationships between tree characteristics and stemflow volumes in a species-rich tropical forest located in central Panama. Based on a sampling setup consisting of ten rainfall collectors, 300 throughfall samplers and 60 stemflow collectors and cumulated data comprising 26 rain events, we derive three main findings. Firstly, stemflow represents a minor hydrological component in the studied 1-ha forest patch (1.0% of cumulated rainfall). Secondly, in the studied species-rich forest, single tree characteristics are only weakly related to stemflow volumes. The influence of multiple tree parameters (e.g. crown diameter, presence of large epiphytes and inclination of branches) and the dependencies among these parameters require a multivariate approach to understand the generation of stemflow. Thirdly, predicting stemflow in species-rich forests based on tree parameters is a difficult task. Although our best model can capture the variation in stemflow to some degree, a critical validation reveals that the model cannot provide robust predictions of stemflow. A reanalysis of data from previous studies in species-rich forests corroborates this finding. Based on these results and considering that for most hydrological applications, stemflow is only one parameter among others to estimate, we advocate using the base model, i.e. the mean of the stemflow data, to quantify stemflow volumes for a given study area. Studies in species-rich forests that wish to obtain predictions of stemflow based on tree parameters probably need to conduct a much more extensive sampling than currently implemented by most studies.

AB Surface water connectivity between waterbodies in a river-floodplain system is considered one of the key determinants of habitat quality, biodiversity and ecological integrity. This manuscript presents results from an investigation into the potential changes in floodplain inundation and connectivity between wetlands and rivers under projected future climates, in a large river catchment in Western Australia. The study was conducted using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model (MIKE 21), and the modelling domain included the floodplain reaches encompassing the ecologically important wetlands. A lumped rainfall-runoff model (SIMHYD) was used to estimate local runoff and inflows from ungauged catchments. A SRTM derived 30-m elevation data was used to parameterize land topography and stream networks in the hydrodynamic model. Hydraulic roughness parameters were estimated using a land cover map, which was developed using a combination of aerial photography, topographic maps and Google Earth imagery. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated using stream gauge data and flood inundation maps derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer imagery. Model simulated stage heights were combined with land topography to identify floodplain pathways that connect wetlands with rivers.
   The connectivity of 30 off-stream wetlands was evaluated under present and future climates. The duration of connection of the individual wetlands to the main river channel varied from 1 to 40 days depending on flood magnitude and duration. Topographic relief, location on the floodplain and magnitude and duration of the flood were found to be key factors governing the level of connectivity, and the relationship between return period of flood and inundated area was found to be non-linear. Modelling under a drier future climate indicated that the duration of connectivity of wetlands could be up to 20% less than under the current climate, whilst under a wetter climate the connectivity could be 5% longer. The results of this study provide potential use for future studies on movement and recruitment patterns of aquatic biota, wetland habitat characteristics and water quality and wetland biodiversity assessment.

AB The temporal and spatial dynamics of groundwater was investigated in a small catchment in the Spanish Pyrenees, which was extensively used for agriculture in the past. Analysis of the water table fluctuations at five locations over a 6-year period demonstrated that the groundwater dynamics had a marked seasonal cycle involving a wetting-up period that commenced with the first autumn rainfall events, a saturation period during winter and spring and a drying-down period from the end of spring until the end of the summer. The length of the saturation period showed great interannual variability, which was mainly influenced by the rainfall and evapotranspiration characteristics. There was marked spatial variability in the water table, especially during the wetting-up period, which could be related to differences in slope and drainage area, geomorphology, soil properties and local topography. Areas contributing to runoff generation were identified within the catchment by field mapping of moisture conditions. Areas contributing to infiltration excess runoff were correlated with former cultivated fields affected by severe sheetwash erosion. Areas contributing to saturation excess runoff were characterized by a marked spatial dynamics associated with catchment wetness conditions. The saturation spatial pattern, which was partially related to the topographic index, was very patchy throughout the catchment, suggesting the influence of other factors associated with past agricultural activities, including changes in local topography and soil properties. The relationship between water table levels and stream flow was weak, especially during the wetting-up period, suggesting little connection between ground water and the hydrological response, at least at some locations. The results suggest that in drier and human-disturbed environments, such as sub-Mediterranean mountains, saturation patterns cannot be represented only by the general topography of the catchment. They also suggest that groundwater storage and runoff is not a succession of steady-state flow conditions, as assumed in most hydrological models. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The USLE/RUSLE model was designed to predict long-term (similar to 20years) average annual soil loss by accounting for the effects of climate, soil, topography and crops. The USLE/RUSLE model operates mathematically in two steps. The first step involves the prediction of soil loss from the unit' plot, a bare fallow area 22.1m long on a 9% slope gradient with cultivation up and down the slope. Appropriate values of the factors accounting for slope length, gradient, crops and crop management and soil conservation practice are then used to adjust that soil loss to predict soil loss from areas that have conditions that are different from the unit plot. Replacing EI30, the USLE/RUSLE event erosivity index, by the product of the runoff ratio (Q(R)) and EI30, can enhance the capacity of the model to predict short-term soil loss from the unit plot if appropriate data on runoff is available. Replacing the EI30 index by another index has consequences on other factors in the model. The USLE/RUSLE soil erodibility factor cannot be used when the erosivity factor is based on Q(R)EI(30). Also, the USLE/RUSLE factors for slope length, slope gradient crops and crop management, and soil conservation practice cannot be used when runoff from other than the unit plot is used to calculate Q(R). Here, equations are provided to convert the USLE/RUSLE factors to values suitable for use when the erosivity factor is based on the Q(R)EI(30) index under these circumstances. At some geographic locations, non linear relationships exist between soil loss from bare fallow areas and the Q(R)EI(30) index. The effect of this on the slope length factor associated with the Q(R)EI(30) index is demonstrated using data from runoff and soil loss plots located at the Sparacia site, Sicily.

AB Catchment-scale transit times for water are increasingly being recognized as an important control on geochemical processes. In this study, snowmelt water mean transit times (MTTs) were estimated for the 15 Krycklan research catchments in northern boreal Sweden. The snowmelt water MTTs were assumed to be representative of the catchment-scale hydrologic response during the spring thaw period and, as such, may be considered to be a component of the catchment's overall MTT. These snowmelt water MTTs were empirically related to catchment characteristics and landscape structure represented by using different indices of soil cover, topography and catchment similarity. Mire wetlands were shown to be significantly correlated to snowmelt MTTs for the studied catchments. In these wetlands, shallow ice layers form that have been shown to serve as impervious boundaries to vertical infiltration during snowmelt periods and, thus, alter the flow pathways of water in the landscape. Using a simple thought experiment, we could estimate the potential effect of thawing of ice layers on snowmelt hydrologic response using the empirical relationship between landscape structure (represented using a catchment-scale Pe number) and hydrologic response. The result of this thought experiment was that there could be a potential increase of 20-45% in catchment snowmelt water MTTs for the Krycklan experimental catchments. It is therefore possible that climatic changes present competing influences on the hydrologic response of northern boreal catchments that need to be considered. For example, MTTs may tend to decrease during some times of the year due to an acceleration in the hydrologic cycle, while they tend to increase MTTs during other times of the year due to shifts in hydrologic flow pathways. The balance between the competing influences on a catchment's MTT has consequences on climatic feedbacks as it could influence hydrological and biogeochemical cycles at the catchment scale for northern latitude boreal catchments.

AB The processes of species obtaining water resources are crucial to evaluate the adaptability of plantations, which can affect the establishment and survival of restored ecosystems and functions of water-limited ecosystems. However, there are still limitations in understanding water use patterns of different four plantations (Populus sylvestris, Salix cheliophe, Hippophae rhamnoides and Artemisia ordosica) in the Qinghai Lake basin. Stable isotopes of xylem water of four individual species were analysed at different dunes located at the eastern shore of Qinghai Lake in 2018 and 2019. The purpose of this study was to explore potential water sources used by different life form plants, to identify whether the soil moisture content and root distribution determined the plants water use patterns. Results from the Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR showed that all species mainly uses three levels of soil water, but they extracted soil water from different layers in different growing seasons among species. All species primarily depended on water from upper soil layers at the early growing stage, but P. sylvestris and S. cheliophe also absorbed much proportion middle and deep soil layers' water in dry year of 2019. All four species shift to use middle or deep soil layer water rather than shallow water in July with the most rainfall and soil water content (SWC). However, it was only used by P. sylvestris and H. rhamnoides in 2018. In all, seasonal water use pattern of different species was affected by SWC, soil texture and root distribution. Compared with moratorium plantations such as S. cheliophe, mixed afforestation of P. sylvestris and H. rhamnoides maximized of soil water sources absorbed by the plants. The study can shed light on plant-water relationships to facilitate the woody species for afforestation and desertification restoration management in the semi-arid desert ecosystem.

AB In this study, we developed the urban ecohydrology model (UEM) to investigate the role of bioretention on watershed water balance, runoff production, and streamflow variability. UEM partitions the land surface into pervious, impervious, and bioretention cell fractions. Soil moisture and vegetation dynamics are simulated in pervious areas and bioretention cells using a lumped ecohydrological approach. Bioretention cells receive runoff from a fraction of impervious areas. The model is calibrated in an urban headwater catchment near Seattle, WA, USA, using hourly weather data and streamflow observations for 3years. The calibrated model is first used to investigate the relationship between streamflow variability and bioretention cell size that receives runoff from different values of impervious area in the watershed. Streamflow variability is quantified by 2 indices, high pulse count (HPC), which quantifies the number of flow high pulses in a water year above a threshold, and high pulse range (HPR), which defines the time over which the pulses occurred. Low values of these indices are associated with improved stream health. The effectiveness of the modelled bioretention facilities are measured by their influence on reducing HPC and HPR and on flow duration curves in comparison with modelled fully forested conditions. We used UEM to examine the effectiveness of bioretention cells under rainfall regimes that are wetter and drier than the study area in an effort to understand linkages between the degree of urbanization, climate, and design bioretention cell size to improve inferred stream health conditions. In all model simulations, limits to the reduction of HPC and HPR indicators were reached as the size of bioretention cells grew. Bioretention was more effective as the rainfall regime gets drier. Results may guide bioretention design practices and future studies to explore climate change impacts on bioretention design and management.

AB We combined a conceptual rainfall-runoff model and input-output relationships of stable isotopes to understand ecohydrological influences on hydrological partitioning in snow-influenced northern catchments. Six sites in Sweden (Krycklan), Canada (Wolf Creek; Baker Creek; Dorset), Scotland (Girnock) and theUSA (Dry Creek) span moisture and energy gradients found at high latitudes. A meta-analysis was carried out using the Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model to estimate the main storage changes characterizing annual water balances. Annual snowpack storage importance was ranked as Wolf Creek > Krycklan > Dorset > Baker Creek > Dry Creek > Girnock. The subsequent rate and longevity of melt were reflected in calibrated parameters that determine partitioning of waters between more rapid and slower flowpaths and associated variations in soil and groundwater storage. Variability of stream water isotopic composition depends on the following: (i) rate and duration of spring snowmelt; (ii) significance of summer/autumn rainfall; and (iii) relative importance of near-surface and deeper flowpaths in routing water to the stream. Flowpath partitioning also regulates influences of summer evaporation on drainage waters. Deviations of isotope data from the Global Meteoric Water Line showed subtle effects of internal catchment processes on isotopic fractionation most likely through evaporation. Such effects are highly variable among sites and with seasonal differences at some sites. After accounting for climate, evaporative fractionation is strongest at sites where lakes and near-surface runoff processes in wet riparian soils can mobilize isotopically enriched water during summer and autumn. Given close soil-vegetation coupling, this may result in spatial variability in soil water isotope pools available for plant uptake. We argue that stable isotope studies are crucial in addressing the many open questions on hydrological functioning of northern environments. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Estimates of sediment yield are essential in water resources analysis, modelling and engineering, in investigations of continental denudation rates, and in studies of drainage basin response to changes in climate and land use. The availability of high resolution, global environmental datasets offers an opportunity to examine the relationships between specific sediment yield (SYsp) and drainage basin attributes in a geographical information system (GIS) environment. This study examines SYsp at 14 long-term gauging stations within the upper Indus River basin. Twenty-nine environmental variables were derived from global datasets, the majority with a 1 x 1 km resolution. The SYsp ranges from 194 to 1302 t km(-2) yr(-1) for sub-basins ranging from 567 to 212 447 km(2). The high degree of scatter in SYsp is greatly reduced when the stations are divided into three groups: upper, glacierized sub-basins; lower, monsoon sub-basins; and the main Indus River. Percentage snow/ice cover (LCs) emerges as the single major land cover control for SYsp in the high mountainous upper Indus River basin. A regression model with percentage snow/ice cover (LCs) as the single independent variable explains 73.4% of the variance in SYsp for the whole Indus basin. A combination of percentage snow/ice cover (LCs), relief and climate variables explains 98.5% of the variance for the upper, glacierized sub-basins. For the lower monsoon region, a regression model with only mean annual precipitation (P) explains 99.4% of the variance. Along the main Indus River, a regression model including just basin relief (R) explains 92.4% of the variance in SYsp. Based on the R-adj(2) and P-value statistics, the variables used are capable of explaining the majority of variance in the upper Indus River basin. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study was designed to develop a physically based hydrological model to describe the hydrological processes within forested mountainous river basins. The model describes the relationships between hydrological fluxes and catchment characteristics that are influenced by topography and land cover. Hydrological processes representative of temperate basins in steep terrain that are incorporated in the model include intercepted rainfall, evaporation, transpiration, infiltration into macropores, partitioning between preferential flow and soil matrix flow, percolation, capillary rise, surface flow (saturation-excess and return flow), subsurface flow (preferential subsurface flow and baseflow) and spatial water-table dynamics. The soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer scheme used was the single-layer Penman-Monteith model, although a two-layer model was also provided. The catchment characteristics include topography (elevation, topographic indices), slope and contributing area, where a digital elevation model provided flow direction on the steepest gradient flow path. The hydrological fluxes and catchment characteristics are modelled based on the variable source-area concept, which defines the dynamics of the watershed response. Flow generated on land for each sub-basin is routed to the river channel by a kinematic wave model. In the river channel, the combined flows from sub-basins are routed by the Muskingum-Cunge model to the river outlet; these comprise inputs to the river downstream. The model was applied to the Hikimi river basin in Japan. Spatial decadal values of the normalized difference vegetation index and leaf area index were used for the yearly simulations. Results were satisfactory, as indicated by model efficiency criteria, and analysis showed that the rainfall input is not representative of the orographic lifting induced rainfall in the mountainous Hikimi river basin. Also, a simple representation of the effects of preferential flow within the soil matrix flow has a slight significance for soil moisture status, but is insignificant for river flow estimations.

AB We use the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) to study the complex water fluctuations of some of the principal Brazilian rivers. We obtain the generalized Hurst exponents for the series of water level of 16 hydrological stations, situated in cities of different climatic zones in Brazil. From this analysis, we can state that all the series analyzed demonstrate multifractality and nonstationary behavior. This paper shows that it is possible to treat the Brazilian river water levels from the multifractal perspective and thereby to have a better understanding of the complex behavior of the scaling laws present within these series.

AB The forecasted runoff is an important input data for the daily operation of hydropower station, and the forecast accuracy directly affects its operation efficiency. However, the forecasting error is inevitable, and it is influenced by the input, the structural parameters and many human factors, it is not only random, but also has great fuzziness. Therefore, it is very important to study the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error and reveal its fuzzy distribution law to guide the actual operation of hydropower station. In view of this, this paper has carried out research work in the following two aspects. At the theoretical level, in order to make the establishment of fuzzy set more objective and scientific, based on different theoretical fuzzy distribution functions and the parameter optimization method, an overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed by coupling the optimal closeness criterion, which can make full use of the guiding role of practical experience and at the same time effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice. At the practical level, in order to quantify the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error, a quantification method for runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is proposed based on the Hamming closeness, Cauchy distribution, Normal distribution and Cusp Gamma distribution. Taking the Jinxi hydropower station of Yalong River basin as the research object, the fuzzy membership functions of the fuzzy sets of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals are calculated and optimized by the proposed method. The results show that the optimized Cusp r distribution can fit the actual data points better compared with Cauchy distribution and Normal distribution, and its average closeness can reach 0.979. So, the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals is well realized, which provides a good basis for the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station operation.

AB In hydrological studies complex drainage structures in river systems are open to ambiguous subjectivity when conventional classification systems are followed. We suggest rules that compliment both Strahler's and Shreve's methods of stream numbering and their extent consideration to reduce this subjective uncertainty. We delineated three possible complex distributary conditions followed by individual application of Strahler's and Shreve's rationales for stream classifications with concurrent verification in real river situations. As a result, for Strahler's method, we derived the decisive criteria in designating correct stream number in complex stream interconnections by plotting minimum number of segments along with the concept of primary and secondary flow. On the other hand, for Shreve's method, splitting the magnitude of the streams at divides of the distributaries yielded precise results. Final real world verification from both applications substantiated the potential of our proposed methodologies to reduce subjectivity in stream classification. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrological processes in mountain headwater basins are changing as climate and vegetation change. Interactions between hydrological processes and subalpine forest ecological function are important to mountain water supplies due to their control on evapotranspiration (ET). Improved understanding of the sensitivity of these interactions to seasonal and interannual changes in snowmelt and summer rainfall is needed as these interactions can impact forest growth, succession, health, and susceptibility to wildfire. To better understand this sensitivity, this research examined ET for a sub-alpine forest in the Canadian Rockies over two contrasting growing seasons and quantified the contribution of transpiration (T) from the younger tree population to overall stand ET. The younger population was focused on to permit examination of trees that have grown under the effect of recent climate change and will contribute to treeline migration, and subalpine forest densification and succession. Research sites were located at Fortress Mountain Research Basin, Kananaskis, Alberta, where the subalpine forest examined is composed of Abies lasiocarpa (Subalpine fir) and Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce). Seasonal changes in water availability from snowmelt, precipitation, soil moisture reserves yielded stark differences in T and ET between 2016 and 2017. ET was higher in the drier year (2017), which had late snowmelt and lower summer rainfall than in the wetter year (2016) that had lower snowmelt and a rainy summer, highlighting the importance of spring snowmelt recharge of soil moisture. However, stand T of the younger trees (73% of forest population) was greater (64 mm) in 2016 (275 mm summer rainfall) than 2017 (39 mm T, 147 mm summer rainfall), and appears to be sensitive to soil moisture decreases in fall, which are largely a function of summer period rainfall. Relationships between subalpine forest water use and different growing season and antecedent (snowmelt period) hydrological conditions clarify the interactions between forest water use and alpine hydrology, which can lead to better anticipation of the hydrological response of subalpine forest-dominated basins to climate variability and change.

AB Few systematic studies of valley-scale geomorphic drivers of streamflow regimes in complex alpine headwaters have compared response between catchments. As a result, little guidance is available for regional-scale hydrological research and monitoring efforts that include assessments of ecosystem function. Physical parameters such as slope, elevation range, drainage area and bedrock geology are often used to stratify differences in streamflow response between sampling sites within an ecoregion. However, these metrics do not take into account geomorphic controls on streamflow specific to glaciated mountain headwaters. The coarse-grained nature of depositional features in alpine catchments suggests that these landforms have little water storage capacity because hillslope runoff moves rapidly just beneath the rock mantle before emerging in fluvial networks. However, recent studies show that a range of depositional features, including talus slopes, protalus ramparts and 'rock-ice' features may have more storage capacity than previously thought.
   To better evaluate potential differences in streamflow response among basins with extensive coarse depositional features and those without, we examined the relationships between streamflow discharge, stable isotopes, water temperature and the amplitude of the diurnal signal at five basin outlets. We also quantified the percentages of colluvial channel length measured along the stepped longitudinal profile. Colluvial channels, characterized by the presence of surficial, coarse-grained depositional features, presented sediment-rich, transport-limited morphologies that appeared to have a cumulative effect on the timing and volume of flow downstream. Measurements taken from colluvial channels flowing through depositional landforms showed median recession constants (K-r) of 0.9-0.95, delta O-18 values of >= - 14.5 and summer diurnal amplitudes <= 0.8 as compared with more typical surface water recession constant values of 0.7, delta O-18 <= -13.5 and diurnal amplitudes >2.0. Our results demonstrated strong associations between the percentage of colluvial channel length within a catchment and moderated streamflow regimes, water temperatures, diurnal signals and depleted delta O-18 related to groundwater influx.

AB The conceptual hydrogeological model of the low to medium temperature Daying and Qicun geothermal fields has been proposed, based on hydrochemical characteristics and isotopic compositions. The two geothermal fields are located in the Xinzhou basin of Shanxi, China and exhibit similarities in their broad-scale flow patterns. Geothermal water is derived from the regional groundwater flow system of the basin and is characterized by Cl center dot SO4-Na type. Thermal water is hydrochemically distinct from cold groundwater having higher total dissolved solids (TDS) (>0.8 g/l) and Sr contents, but relatively low Ca, Mg and HCO3 contents. Most shallow groundwater belongs to local flow systems which are subject to evaporation and mixing with irrigation returns. The groundwater residence times estimated by tritium and C-14 activities indicate that deep non-thermal groundwater (130-160 m) in the Daying region range from modern (post-1950s) in the piedmont area to more than 9.4 ka BP (Before Present) in the downriver area and imply that this water belong to an intermediate flow system. Thermal water in the two geothermal fields contains no detectable active C-14, indicating long residence times (>50 ka), consistent with this water being part of a large regional flow system. The mean recharge elevation estimated by using the obtained relationship Altitude (m) = -23.8 x delta H-2 (parts per thousand) - 121.3, is 1980 and 1880 m for the Daying and Qicun geothermal fields, respectively. The annual infiltration rates in the Daying and Qicun geothermal fields can be estimated to be 9029 x 10(3) and 4107 x 10(3) m(3)/a, respectively. The variable Sr-86/Sr-87 values in the thermal and non-thermal groundwater in the two fields reflect different lithologies encountered along the flow path(s) and possibly different extents of water-rock interaction. Based on the analysis of groundwater flow systems in the two geothermal fields, hydrogeochemical inverse modelling was performed to indicate the possible water-rock interaction processes that occur under different scenarios.

AB Modelling the hydrologic processes of semiarid basins is specially challenging due to the specific characteristics of this type of environment. The discontinuity of the processes both in space and in time produces a highly complicated rainfall-runoff relationship. Runoff production and reinfiltration areas produce a discontinuous spatial pattern of runoff; channel flow is ephemeral and restricted to the wet season of the year or to heavy rainfalls, and many local saturated layers of soil separated by unsaturated areas can occur. The hydrological connection of the different parts of the basin produces a nonlinear and complex hydrologic behaviour because different response mechanisms of the basin are triggered as the hydrological connectivity increases. Similarly, as connectivity decreases, so does the information arriving at the monitored state variables used to calibrate the model and to understand the system. This paper describes the application of a distributed hydrologic model to describe the hydrologic behaviour of a small semiarid basin including surface and subsurface processes. The model is parameterized and calibrated to simulate a period of 71 days covering the transition of the basin from a dry to a wet state, during which most of the hydrologic processes of the basin are activated. The calibration strategy used different sources and types of information on the state of the basin and an efficient gradient based search algorithm to find the optimal values of the most sensitive parameters. The modelled hydrograph and the modelled internal description of the basin were analysed in the light of its known behaviour and the existing knowledge of semiarid hydrology reported in the literature. The results indicate that while the integrated behaviour of the basin represented by the output hydrograph can be well reproduced, the subsurface processes and the internal dynamics of the basin are less accurately simulated, mainly due to the lack of information on the geometry of the subsurface domain (soil depths and bedrock topography) and on the spatial distribution of the parameters.

AB Electrical conductivity of meltwaters in the Batura river which drains from the portal of Batura glacier in the Karakoram mountains was recorded continuously, together with stage, throughout an ablation season with the aim of estimating the annual total solute flux from the 56% glacier-covered basin. Through-time variations of meltwater cationic concentration were obtained from the electrical conductivity record using a rating curve established between sums of cations determined in periodically-collected samples of meltwater and electrical conductivity measured at the times of sampling. Hourly average cationic flux was then obtained as the product of cationic concentration and discharge, error arising as a result of inaccuracy in river gauging and use of the rating relationship. Electrical conductivity varied diurnally inversely with discharge, overall level decreasing as discharge increased in spring, continuing subdued through July and August irrespective of episodic discharge fluctuations. In contrast, solute flux mimicked discharge variation, low solute concentrations being offset by the volume of water flowing. Total annual cationic flux from Batura basin was 1.03 Meq +/- similar to 15%. Assuming almost all of the flux was derived subglacially, the solute flux from beneath Batura glacier was 2.64 +/- 0.40 eq m(-2) a(-1). These rates of cationic denudation, substantially higher than the continental average, are at the top end of the global range of reasonably-reliable estimates for other smaller glacierized basins. Carbonate lithology, high annual runoff, high sediment concentration in meltwaters, and long subglacial pathways account for the high solute flux from Batura glacier. Through longer residence times of meltwater in transit under ice and higher discharges, dissolution kinetics and flow couple to enhance solute fluxes from larger glaciers. Although subglacial chemical denudation in the Karakoram mountains is significant in carbon cycling at the continental scale, such carbonate dissolution probably contributes little to net consumption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

AB Distributed, continuous hydrologic models promote better understanding of hydrology and enable integrated hydrologic analyses by providing a more detailed picture of water transport processes across the varying landscape. However, such models are not widely used in routine modelling practices, due in part to the extensive data input requirements, computational demands, and complexity of routing algorithms. We developed a two-dimensional continuous hydrologic model, HYSTAR, using a time-area method within a grid-based spatial data model with the goal of providing an alternative way to simulate spatiotemporally varied watershed-scale hydrologic processes. The model calculates the direct runoff hydrograph by coupling a time-area routing scheme with a dynamic rainfall excess sub-model implemented here using a modified curve number method with an hourly time step, explicitly considering downstream reinfiltration' of routed surface runoff. Soil moisture content is determined at each time interval based on a water balance equation, and overland and channel runoff is routed on time-area maps, representing spatial variation in hydraulic characteristics for each time interval in a storm event. Simulating runoff hydrographs does not depend on unit hydrograph theory or on solution of the Saint Venant equation, yet retains the simplicity of a unit hydrograph approach and the capability of explicitly simulating two-dimensional flow routing. The model provided acceptable performance in predicting daily and monthly runoff for a 6-year period for a watershed in Virginia (USA) using readily available geographic information about the watershed landscape. Spatial and temporal variability in simulated effective runoff depth and time area maps dynamically show the areas of the watershed contributing to the direct runoff hydrograph at the outlet over time, consistent with the variable source area overland flow generation mechanism. The model offers a way to simulate watershed processes and runoff hydrographs using the time-area method, providing a simple, efficient, and sound framework that explicitly represents mechanisms of spatially and temporally varied hydrologic processes.

AB Tropical regions are experiencing high rates of forest cover loss coupled with changes in the volume and timing of rainfall. These shifts can compromise streamflow and water provision, highlighting the need to identify how forest cover influences streamflow generation under variable rainfall conditions. Although rainfall is the key driver of streamflow regimes, the role of forests is less clear, particularly in tropical regions where forest loss is an ongoing risk. Forest cover loss alters evapotranspiration, rainfall infiltration and storage, and may increase stream ecosystem vulnerability to rainfall extremes. Puerto Rico, an island with spatially heterogenous forest cover and a marked geographic rainfall gradient, is projected to experience more frequent droughts and flash flooding. Using 15-min streamflow data collected between 2005 and 2016 from 20 US Geological Survey stream gages and 3-hourly Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation rainfall estimates, we utilized flow-duration curves and linear mixed regression models to examine the role of forest cover in regulating the timing and volume of streamflow. The mixed model approach helps to account for differences in watershed characteristics. We determined the effects of rainfall and forest cover on low and peak flows in Puerto Rican streams, then evaluated changes in these relationships under dry and wet antecedent rainfall conditions. Watersheds with high forest cover had consistently greater low and peak streamflow than deforested ones under all rainfall conditions, although the effect was more marked during wet antecedent conditions, suggesting that peak flow is largely the result of saturation excess overland flow. During dry antecedent rainfall conditions, highly forested watersheds had higher streamflow than deforested ones, suggesting greater hillslope storage and release may also be at play. Our results demonstrate that forest cover generated a net increase in hillslope infiltration and storage and may lessen drought impacts on streamflow in Puerto Rico. Resilience to prolonged drought may be limited by finite water storage potential in this steep, mountainous setting, highlighting maintenance of forest cover as an important water management strategy to increase infiltration.

AB Continuing long and extensive wildfire seasons in the Western US emphasize the need for better understanding of wildfire impacts including post-fire management scenarios. Advancements in our understanding of post-fire hillslope erosion and watershed response such as flooding, sediment yield, and debris flows have recently received considerable attention. The potential impacts of removing dead trees, called salvage logging, has been studied, however the use of remotely sensed imagery after salvage logging to evaluate spatial patterns and recovery is novel. The 2015 North Star Fire provided an opportunity to evaluate hillslope erosion reduction using two field experiments and coincidental remotely sensed imagery over 3 years. Simulated rill experiments with four flow rates were used to quantify hillslope erosion on skidder trails with and without added logging slash compared with a burned-only control. Seven replicated hillslope silt fence plots with the same treatments were also evaluated for natural rainfall events. WorldView-2 satellite imagery was used to relate ground cover and erodible bare soil between the two experiments using multi-temporal Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Results indicate that the skid trails produced significantly more sediment (0.70 g s(-1)) than either the slash treated skid trail (0.34 g s(-1)) or controls (0.04 g s(-1)) with the simulated rill experiment. Similarly, under natural rainfall conditions sediment yield from hillslope silt fence plots was significantly greater for the skid trail (3.42 Mg ha(-1)) than either the slash treated skid trail (0.18 Mg ha(-1)) or controls (0 Mg ha(-1)). An NDVI value of 0.32 on all plots over all years corresponded to a ground cover of about 60% which is an established threshold for erosion reduction. Significant relationships between NDVI, ground cover, and sediment values suggest that NDVI may help managers evaluate ground cover and erosion potential remotely after disturbances such as a wildfire or salvage logging.

   QUANTIFICATION
AB Urban green spaces (UGS), like most managed land covers, are getting progressively affected by water scarcity and drought. Preserving, restoring and expanding UGS require sustainable management of green and blue water resources to fulfil evapotranspiration (ET) demand for green plant cover. The heterogeneity of UGS with high variation in their microclimates and irrigation practices builds up the complexity of ET estimation. In oversized UGS, areas too large to be measured with in situ ET methods, remote sensing (RS) approaches of ET measurement have the potential to estimate the actual ET. Often in situ approaches are not feasible or too expensive. We studied the effects of spatial resolution using different satellite images, with high-, medium- and coarse-spatial resolutions, on the greenness and ET of UGS using Vegetation Indices (VIs) and VI-based ET, over a 780-ha urban park in Adelaide, Australia. We validated ET with the ground-based ET method of Soil Water Balance. Three sets of imagery from WorldView2, Landsat and MODIS, and three VIs including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2), were used to assess long-term changes of VIs and ET calculated from the different imagery acquired for this study (2011-2018). We found high correspondence between ET-MODIS and ET-Landsat (R-2 > 0.99 for all VIs). Landsat-VIs captured the seasonal changes of greenness better than MODIS-VIs. We used artificial neural network (ANN) to relate the RS-ET and ground data, and ET-MODIS (EVI2) showed the highest correlation (R-2 = 0.95 and MSE =0.01 for validation). We found a strong relationship between RS-ET and in situ measurements, even though it was not explicable by simple regressions; black box models helped us to explore their correlation. The methodology used in this research makes a strong case for the value of remote sensing in estimating and managing ET of green spaces in water-limited cities.

AB Marine overwash events are among the most serious short-term threats to groundwater supply of small coral islands. During such events, seawater can inundate small islands partially or completely, causing salinization of the aquifer. A comprehensive knowledge of freshwater lens recovery is essential for water planners on these islands. In this study, a numerical modelling approach is used to quantify recovery of the freshwater lens on 4 islands of the Maldives after a tsunami-induced overwash event similar to that experienced from the Indian Ocean earthquake in December 2004. The islands vary in size (0.2 to 10.1km(2)) and span the climatic regions of the Maldives. A tested 3-dimensional SEAWAT groundwater model for each island is used to simulate the recovery process. Recharge rates from historical rainfall data and from global climate models are imposed on each island during the post-overwash recovery period. The effect of groundwater pumping on lens recovery also is examined. Results show abrupt decrease in fresh groundwater volumes for each island, followed by recovery that is significantly influenced by island size and recharge patterns. Overall, salinization is more widespread on small islands (<1km(2)), but recovery is more rapid than for large islands. Between 50% and 90% of lens recovery occurs after 2years for small islands (<1km(2)) whereas only 35% and 55% for large islands. Imposing pumping rates required to sustain the local population lengthened the recovery time between 5% and 15%, with smaller islands having the higher percentage. However, the governing factor on recovery time is the spatial extent of land surface inundation by the overwash event, with wave height and duration of the event having a negligible impact. A strong relationship exists between required recovery time and island surface area, thereby providing a method to determine recovery time for other atoll islands not investigated in this study with similar geologic structure. Our results can be used to aid in managing water resources during the post-overwash period.

AB The Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) was modified to correct an underestimation of the winter albedo in evergreen needleleaf forests. Default values for the visible and near-infrared albedo of a canopy with intercepted snow, (VIS,cs) and (NIR,cs), respectively, were too small, and the fraction of the canopy covered with snow, f(snow), increased too slowly with interception, producing a damped albedo response. A new model for f(snow) is based on z(I*), the effective depth of newly intercepted snow required to increase the canopy albedo to its maximum, which corresponds in the model with f(snow)=1. Snow unloading rates were extracted from visual assessments of photographs and modelled based on relationships with meteorological variables, replacing the time-based method employed in CLASS. These parameterizations were tested in CLASS version 3.6 at boreal black spruce and jack pine forests in Saskatchewan, Canada, a subalpine Norway spruce and silver fir forest at Alptal, Switzerland, and a boreal maritime forest at Hitsujigaoka, Japan. Model configurations were assessed based on the index of agreement, d, relating simulated and observed daily albedo. The new model employs (VIS,cs)=0.27, (NIR,cs)=0.38 and z(I*)=3cm. The best single-variable snow unloading algorithm, determined by the average cross-site d, was based on wind speed. Two model configurations employing ensemble averages of the unloading rate as a function of total incoming radiation and wind speed, and air temperature and wind speed, respectively, produced larger minimum cross-site d values but a smaller average. The default configuration of CLASS 3.6 produced a cross-site average d from October to April of 0.58. The best model employing a single parameter (wind speed at the canopy top) for modelling the unloading rate produced an average d of 0.86, while the two-parameter ensemble-average unloading models produced a minimum d of 0.81 and an average d of 0.84.

AB A global river discharge simulation was conducted that accounted for 452 individually operated reservoirs by Locating them on the digital global river network map of TRIP, a global river routing model. An operating rule was determined for each reservoir using a newly-developed algorithm that used currently available global data such as reservoir storage capacity, intended purposes, simulated inflow, and water demand in the lower reaches. This algorithm reduced the root mean square error of reservoir release and river discharge simulations from that of earlier global river discharge simulations that neglected reservoir operations or substituted an algorithm for natural-take outflow. The 2-year global simulation results indicate that reservoir operations substantially altered monthly discharge for individual basins (i.e., by more than 20%). Averaged over the continental scale, the maximum change in monthly river discharge varied from 0% to 34% and the changes in reservoir storage were small as a proportion of the total storage capacity.

AB Monte Carlo simulations are used to (1) investigate the accuracy of approximations that are implicit in first-order stochastic dispersion theories and (2) identify the accuracy limits of first-order dispersion theories in isotropic porous media. The Fickian theory of Gelhar and Axness (1983), as well as the Fickian and non-Fickian theories of Dagan (1984) and Neuman and Zhang (1990) are investigated. All Monte Carlo simulations are in three dimensions. Confidence limits of ensemble-averaged Monte Carlo results in isotropic porous media are established for 0.1 less-than-or-equal-to sigma(Y) less-than-or-equal-to 1.5. These results showed that first-order theoretical estimates of the Eulerian velocity covariance function are quite accurate for sigma(Y) < 1; theoretical estimates of the non-Fickian longitudinal dispersivity do not deviate significantly from theory for at least sigma(Y) less-than-or-equal-to 1.5; theoretical estimation of the transverse dispersivity is limited to sigma(Y) < 1; and, the Fickian longitudinal dispersivity is overestimated by the theory of Gelhar and Axness (1983). Of all first-order dispersion theories, the theory of Dagan (1984) is most robust in estimating the dispersivity tensor.

AB During past decades, a diverse system of subsistence agriculture in south-east Spain (annual rainfall of less than 300 mm) has been overturned in favour of large-scale plantations of almond trees without consideration for topography and related spatial patterns in soil hydrological properties. The objective of this paper is to investigate the spatial pattern in soil physical properties induced by this cultivation system, and to highlight its impacts on the water balance. Soil properties were recorded along hillslopes with shallow soils developed on slates and greywackes in the upper part of the Guadalentin drainage basin (Murcia region). Frequent tillage of these almond plantations covering entire hillslopes has resulted in denudation by tillage erosion on the topographic convexities, as well as transport of rock fragments and fine earth along the slopes. These processes have created a systematic spatial pattern of soil thickness and rock fragment content: shallow and stony soils on the topographic convexities and deep soils with a rock fragment mulch in the concavities at the foot of the slopes. At the same time, a negative relationship between rock fragment content and fine earth bulk density was observed. The impact of this spatial pattern in soil properties on the water balance was evaluated using the PATTERN one-dimensional hydrological and plant growth model, The model simulates the water balance of soil profiles covering the observed variation in soil thickness, stoniness and bulk density. The model results indicate that the highest rates of infiltration, evaporation and drainage, as well as the lowest rates of overland flow are restricted to shallow soils on the hilltops. In contrast, the deeper soils in the valley bottoms produce a more stable moisture regime than shallower soils, which tend to saturate and dry out quickly. These model results are in agreement with the spatial patterns of almond productivity: an asymptotic increase with soil thickness. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Water resource management in ungauged catchments is complex due to uncertainties around the hydrological parameters that characterize streamflow behaviour. These parameters are usually defined by regionalization approaches, in which the hydrological response patterns of ungauged basins are inferred from those of gauged basins. Regression-based methods using physical properties derived from cartographic data sources are widely used. The current remote sensing techniques offer new opportunities for the regionalization of hydrological parameters since the hydrological response depends on the physical attributes related to the spectral responses of a given land surface. Moreover, machine learning approaches have not been specifically applied to the regionalization of hydrological parameters in forested areas. This work studies the capability of a catchment's spectral signature based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to address a regression-based regionalization of hydrological model parameters using a machine learning approach. Hydrological modelling was conducted by the HBV-light model. We tested the random forest algorithm in several regionalization scenarios: the new approach using the catchments' spectral signature, the traditional method using physical properties and a fusion of these methods. The calibration results were excellent (median KGE = 0.83), and the regionalized parameters achieved good performance, in which the three scenarios showed almost the same goodness of fit (median KGE = 0.45-0.50). We found that the effectiveness depends on the climatic environment and that predictions in humid catchments exhibited better performance than those in the driest catchments. The physical approach (median KGE = 0.71) exhibited better performance than the spectral approach (median KGE = 0.64) in humid catchments, whereas spectral regionalization (median KGE = 0.33) enhanced the physical scenario in the driest catchments (median KGE = 0.25). Our results confirm that regionalization is still challenging in drier climates, such as in the Mediterranean environment. The new spectral approach showed promising results and it was effective in the analysis of the relationship between the spectral response of the territory and its hydrological characteristics, specially, where no cartographic data is available.

AB Numerous efforts have been made to understand stemflow dynamics under different types of vegetation at the inter-event scale, but few studies have explored the stemflow characteristics and corresponding influencing factors at the intra-event scale. An in-depth investigation of the inter- and intra-event dynamics of stemflow is important for understanding the ecohydrological processes in forest ecosystems. In this study, stemflow volume (F-V), stemflow funnelling ratio (F-R), and stemflow ratio (F-%) from Quercus acutissima and Broussonetia papyrifera trees were measured at both inter- and intra-event scales in a subtropical deciduous forest, and the driving factors, including tree species and meteorological factors were further explored. Specifically, the F-V, F-R and F-% of Q. acutissima (52.3 L, 47.2, 9.6%) were lower than those of B. papyrifera (85.1 L, 91.2, 12.4%). The effect of tree species on F-V and F-% was more obvious under low intensity rainfall types. At the inter-event scale, F-V had a strong positive linear correlation with rainfall amount (G(P)) and event duration (D-E) for both tree species, whereas F-R and F-% had a positive logarithmic correlation with G(P) and D-E only under high-intensity, short-duration rainfall type. F-R and F-% were mainly affected by wind speed and the maximum 30-min rainfall intensity under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall type. At the intra-event scale, for both tree species, the mean lag time between the start of rainfall and stemflow was the shortest under high-intensity, short-duration rainfall type, while the mean duration and amount of stemflow after rain cessation were the greatest under high-amount, long-duration rainfall type. The relationship between stemflow intensity and rainfall intensity at the 5-min interval scale also depended greatly on rainfall type. These findings can help clarify stemflow dynamics and driving factors at both inter- and intra-event scales, and also provide abundant data and parameters for ecohydrological simulations in subtropical forests.

AB Discharge simulation from snow-dominated catchments seems to be an easy task. Any spatially explicit precipitation-runoff model coupled to a temperature-index snow model generally yields simulations that mimic well the observed daily discharges. The robustness of such models is, however, questionable: in the presence of strong annual discharge cycles, small model residuals do not guarantee high explanatory power of the underlying model. This paper proposes a methodology for snow hydrological model identification within a limits-of-acceptability framework, where acceptable model simulations are the ones that reproduce a set of signatures within an a priori specified range. The signatures proposed here namely include the relationship between the air temperature regime and the discharge regime, a new snow hydrology signature that can be readily transferred to other Alpine settings. The discriminatory power of all analysed signatures is assessed with a new measure of their discriminatory power in the model prediction domain. The value of the proposed snow hydrology signatures and of the limits-of-acceptability approach is demonstrated for the Dischma river in Switzerland, whose discharge shows a strong temporal variability of hydrologic forcing conditions over the last 30 years. The signature-based model identification for this case study leads to the surprising conclusion that the observed discharge data contains a multi-year period that cannot be reproduced with the model at hand. This model-data mismatch might well result from a yet to be identified problem with the discharge observations, which would have been difficult to detect in a classical residual-based model identification approach. Overall, the detailed results for this case study underline the robustness of the limits-of-acceptability approach in the presence of error-prone observations if it is applied in combination with relatively robust signatures. Future work will show whether snow hydrology signatures and their limits-of-acceptability can be regionalized to ungauged catchments, which would make this model selection approach particularly powerful for Alpine environments.

AB Cryoturbated Upper Chalk is a dichotomous porous medium wherein the intra-fragment porosity provides water storage and the inter-fragment porosity provides potential pathways for relatively rapid flow near saturation. Chloride tracer movement through 43 cm long and 45 cm diameter undisturbed chalk columns was studied at water application rates of 0.3, 1.0, and 1.5 cm h(-1). Microscale heterogeneity in effluent was recorded using a grid collection system consisting of 98 funnel-shaped cells each 3.5 cm in diameter. The total porosity of the columns was 0.47 +/- 0.02 m(3) m(-3), approximately 13% of pores were >15 mu m diameter, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity was 12.66 +/- 1.31 m day(-1). Although the column remained unsaturated during the leaching even at all application rates, proportionate flow through macropores increased as the application rate decreased. The number of dry cells (with 0 ml of effluent) increased as application rate decreased. Half of the leachate was collected from 15, 19 and 22 cells at 0.3, 1.0, 1.5 cm h(-1) application rates respectively. Similar breakthrough curves (BTCs) were obtained at all three application rates when plotted as a function of cumulative drainage, but they were distinctly different when plotted as a function of time. The BTCs indicate that the columns have similar drainage requirement irrespective of application rates, as the rise to the maxima (C/C-o) is almost similar. However, the time required to achieve that leaching requirement varies with application rates, and residence time was less in the case of a higher application rate. A two-region convection-dispersion model was used to describe the BTCs and fitted well (r(2) = 0.97-0-99). There was a linear relationship between dispersion coefficient and pore water velocity (correlation coefficient r = 0.95). The results demonstrate the microscale heterogeneity of hydrodynamic properties in the Upper Chalk. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In watershed modelling, the traditional practice of arbitrarily filling topographic depressions in digital elevation models has raised concerns. Advanced high-resolution remote sensing techniques, including airborne scanning laser altimetry, can identify naturally occurring depressions that impact overland flow. In this study, we used an ensemble physical and statistical modelling approach, including a 2D hydraulic model and two-point connectivity statistics, to quantify the effects of depressions on high-resolution overland flow patterns across spatial scales and their temporal variations in single storm events. Computations for both models were implemented using graphic processing unit-accelerated computing. The changes in connectivity statistics for overland flow patterns between airborne scanning laser altimetry-derived digital elevation models with (original) and without (filled) depressions were used to represent the shifts of overland flow response to depressions. The results show that depressions can either decrease or increase (to a lesser degree and shorter duration) the probability that any two points (grid locations) are hydraulically connected by overland flow pathways. We used macro-connectivity states (phi) as a watershed-specific indicator to describe the spatiotemporal thresholds of connectivity variability caused by depressions. Four states of phi are identified in a studied watershed, and each state represents different magnitudes of connectivity and connectivity changes (caused by depressions). The magnitude of connectivity variability corresponds to the states of phi, which depend on the topological relationship between depressions, the rising/recession limb, and the total rainfall amount in a storm event. In addition, spatial distributions of connectivity variability correlate with the density of depression locations and their physical structures, which cause changes in streamflow discharge magnitude. Therefore, this study suggests that depressions are "nontrivial" in watershed modelling, and their impacts on overland flow should not be neglected. Connectivity statistics at different spatial scales and time points within a watershed provide new insights for characterizing the distributed and accumulated effects of depressions on overland flow.

AB In the decades since dramatic reductions in acid emissions and subsequent deposition in North America and Europe, the vast majority of research on aquatic chemical recovery has focused on trends in acid-base concentrations during baseflow conditions. Missing from such assessments is consideration of higher flow periods, when flow paths and chemical concentrations change and episodic acidification may occur. Stream samples collected weekly and bi-hourly during high-flow storm events from 1992 to 2015 at three watersheds representing a gradient in response to acid deposition in the south-eastern United States were used to evaluate temporal trends in acid anions, base cations, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), and pH for each of five distinct flow exceedance regimes, as well as trends in concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships. For the most well-buffered watershed (mean ANC=220 mu eq L-1), ANC and pH increased at a similar rate for baseflow and storm flow conditions. Decreases in sulfate controlled ANC trends at higher flows, whereas smaller sulfate decreases in combination with base cation increases resulted in similar ANC improvements for low-flow periods. For the most acid sensitive watershed (mean ANC=10 mu eq L-1), no trends in ANC or pH were observed for the lowest flows (>90% flow exceedance), whereas reductions in sulfate resulted in significant increases in ANC during higher flow conditions. At all sites, greater rates of sulfate decline during high-flow, as compared with low-flow, conditions are likely a result of a reduced capacity of near surface soils to adsorb and retain sulfur in these non-glaciated watersheds. Overall, consistent increases in pH (similar to 0.01-0.02pH units year(-1)) during higher flow conditions (<10% flow exceedance) in contrast to the variable trends observed during lower flows (>50% flow exceedance) illustrate that episodic acidification is recovering at an equal or greater rate than chronic acidification in these watersheds.

AB A precise estimation of sediment transport capacity (T-c) is key to establishing process-based erosion models. However, few data are available for estimating transport capacity on steep slopes and test materials sorted at high coarse grain values of >2 mm. Colluvial deposits with loose, coarse material and steep slopes make up the packed materials underlying the collapsing walls in benggang, which collapse due to hydraulic pressure and gravity. The objectives of this study were to investigate how flow discharge and slope steepness affect T-c and to examine relationships between T-c and flow velocity, shear stress, stream power, and unit stream power for colluvial deposits found on steep slopes. A nonerodible rill flume of 4 m long and 0.12 m wide was used. Slope steepness values ranged from 18% to 84%, and unit flow discharge values ranged from 0.56 x 10(-3) to 4.44 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1). T-c increased as a power function with flow discharge and slope steepness with a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) value of 0.99, and the effects of flow discharge were stronger than those of slope steepness. T-c was overestimated for a colluvial deposit when the equations of the ANSWERS, Zhang et al. and Wu et al. models were considered and when T-c exceeded 5 kg m(-1) s(-1), as the slope steepness used in our study was much higher than those used (<47%) in the other models. Regression analyses show that T-c can be predicted from linear equations of flow velocity, stream power, and unit stream power, and T-c can be fit to shear stress with power function equation. Flow velocity optimizes to predict T-c with NSE = 0.97, and stream power and shear stress can also be successfully related to T-c (NSE = 0.91 and NSE = 0.81, respectively); however, unit stream power performs poorly (NSE = 0.67). These results provide a basis for establishing process-based erosion models on steep colluvial slopes.

AB The persistence of snow cover across mountainous landscapes influences land-atmosphere energy exchange, water availability, the partitioning of snowmelt into various hydrologic pathways, vegetation productivity, and fluxes of nutrients. Understanding the processes controlling snow cover persistence has been limited as relationships between physiography, climate, and snow persistence are nonlinear and difficult to characterize empirically. The work detailed herein uses 7 years of remotely sensed snow cover persistence observed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer over the Sierra Nevada Mountains as a dependent variable in binary regression tree models with a suite of independent variables comprised of both physiographic and climatic metrics. Annual snow cover persistence over 2001-2007 revealed significant inter-annual variability, with domain-average snow persistence values exceeding 4.01 (i. e. early April) in the wettest year of 2005 and reaching as low as 2.90 (i. e. late February) in the driest year of 2007. Regression tree models revealed that elevation was the most important explanatory variable regarding snow cover persistence, ranking first in the hierarchical models in 10 out of 13 watersheds. Precipitation (Feather and Owens River basins) and temperature (Kern River basin) were the first-ranking variables in the remaining three watersheds. Second, the order variables of importance included vegetation, which ranked between 2nd and 5th in 10 of 13 watersheds, and slope, which ranked 4th and 5th in 12 of the 13 watersheds. Interestingly, solar radiation and aspect were of tertiary importance but were more influential in watersheds with north-south orientation (e. g. in the Feather, Mokelumne and Stanislaus watersheds). These results have implications for understanding the sensitivity of snow cover persistence to changes in climate as watersheds where elevation and/or temperature strongly influence snow cover persistence may be more sensitive to future warming. Further work is needed to identify associated ecosystem sensitivities to future changes in snow cover persistence. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The index flood procedure coupled with the L-moments method is applied to the annual flood peaks data taken at all stream-gauging stations in Turkey having at least 15-year-long records. First, screening of the data is done based on the discordancy measure (D-t) in terms of the L-moments. Homogeneity of the total geographical area of Turkey is tested using the L-moments based heterogeneity measure, H, computed on 500 simulations generated using the four parameter Kappa distribution. The L-moments analysis of the recorded annual flood peaks data at 543 gauged sites indicates that Turkey as a whole is hydrologically heterogeneous, and 45 of 543 gauged sites are discordant which are discarded from further analyses. The catchment areas of these 543 sites vary from 9.9 to 75121 km(2) and their mean annual peak floods vary from 1.72 to 3739.5 m(3) s(-1). The probability distributions used in the analyses, whose parameters are computed by the L-moments method are the general extreme values (GEV), generalized logistic (GLO), generalized normal (GNO), Pearson type III (PE3), generalized Pareto (GPA), and five-parameter Wakeby (WAK). Based on the L-moment ratio diagrams and the |Z(dist)|-statistic criteria, the GEV distribution is identified as the robust distribution for the study area (498 gauged sites). Hence, for estimation of flood magnitudes of various return periods in Turkey, a regional flood frequency relationship is developed using the GEV distribution. Next, the quantiles computed at all of 543 gauged sites by the GEV and the Wakeby distributions are compared with the observed values of the same probability based on two criteria, mean absolute relative error and determination coefficient. Results of these comparisons indicate that both distributions of GEV and Wakeby, whose parameters are computed by the L-moments method, are adequate ;in predicting quantile estimates.

AB Verification of distributed hydrologic models is rare owing to the lack of spatially detailed field measurements and a common mismatch between the scale at which soil hydraulic properties are measured and the scale of a single modelling unit. In this study, two of the most commonly calibrated parameters, i.e. soil depth and the vertical distribution of lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s, were eliminated by a spatially detailed soil characterization and results of a hillslope-scale field experiment. The soil moisture routing (SMR) model, a geographic information system-based hydrologic model, was modified to represent the dominant hydrologic processes for the Palouse region of northern Idaho. Modifications included K, as a double exponential function of depth in a single soil layer, a snow accumulation and melt algorithm, and a simple relationship between storage and perched water depth (PWD) using the drainable porosity. The model was applied to a 2 ha catchment without calibration to measured data. Distributed responses were compared with observed PWD over a 3-year period on a 10 in x 15 m grid. Integrated responses were compared with observed surface runoff at the catchment outlet. The modified SMR model simulated the PWD fluctuations remarkably well, especially considering the shallow soils in this catchment: a 0.20 m error in PWD is equivalent to only a 1.6% error in predicted soil moisture content. Simulations also captured PWD fluctuations during a year with high spatial variability of snow accumulation and snowmelt rates at upslope, mid-slope, and toe slope positions with errors as low as 0.09 m, 0.12 m, and 0.12 m respectively. Errors in distributed and integrated model simulations were attributed mostly to misrepresentation of rain events and snowmelt timing problems. In one location in the catchment, simulated PWD was consistently greater than observed PWD. indicating a localized recharge zone, which was not identified by the soil morphological survey.

AB Ecosystem health and water quality of rivers are dependent on their temperature. With ongoing human-induced climate change causing increases in air temperature across the globe, it is anticipated the stream temperatures will rise too-in turn increasing the rates of biogeochemical stream processes and potentially threatening the viability and health of aquatic organisms. To understand the relationship between climate change and stream temperature response, the longer the records that can be analysed, the more the robust the analysis for detecting change. In this study, we analyse records from 263 catchments from across the United Kingdom for 45 years from 1974 to 2019 to assess the link between air temperature and stream temperature change. To give the most precise analysis of these long records, Bayesian hierarchical modelling was used and showed that: (i) The Bayesian hierarchical approach was 59% more precise, that is, reduced uncertainty on long-term trends, than using simple linear regression. (ii) The increase in annual average air temperature over 45 years across the United Kingdom showed no significant differences between 22 weather stations and gave a 45-year change of 1.35 +/- 0.9 degrees C. (iii) Trends in annual mean stream temperature change varied from -2.3 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C over 45 years, with the mean over 263 sites being 0.5 degrees C over 45 years. (iv) 1% of rivers showed a stream temperature trend significantly greater than the air temperature trend but 3% of sites showed a stream temperature trend significantly lower than zero. (v) 74% of all river sites showed no significant monotonic trend, either positive or negative, in water temperature even after 45 years. The observed declines in stream temperature could be ascribed to the closures of thermoelectric power stations but it is unclear why the stream temperature at some sites has risen faster than air temperature. The study shows that mean river temperature was well buffered against changes in air temperature-a 1 degrees C rise in air temperature giving 0.37 degrees C in mean stream temperature.

AB Soil hydraulic properties control the provision of hydrological services. Vegetation and topography influence these properties by altering soil structure and porosity. The underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood for the high Andean region. In this study, we examined how vegetation and topographic attributes are related to soil hydraulic properties and soil pore structure in young volcanic ash soils, and further correlated them to soil texture, organic carbon, and root characteristics to explain these relationships. In a 0.7 km(2) study site located in the Andean paramo of northern Ecuador, we measured soil water retention, saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density (BD), and pore size distribution parameters on eight soil profiles with contrasting vegetation types (cushion-forming plants vs. tussock grasses) and topographic positions (summit vs. hillslope). We observed significant differences in soil hydraulic properties and soil pore structure in the uppermost horizons by vegetation type, whereas topography had a minor effect. In the A horizons, we found higher water retention at saturation and field capacity (10%-14%), higher total available water (8%-15%), and higher saturated hydraulic conductivity (4-12 times) under cushion-forming plants compared to tussock grasses. The elevated values under cushion plants were attributed to the presence of larger pores, lower soil BD, and higher soil organic carbon content as a result of coarser root systems. Total available water was generally high (0.34-0.40 cm(3) cm(-3)), and locally not associated with any soil property. The higher water retention in soils under cushion vegetation can enhance soil water storage for plants and the regulation of water flows during prolonged rainfall events. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface horizons is high compared to rainfall intensities resulting in high infiltration capacity; whilst its decline with depth reveals the potential for generation of subsurface stormflow, especially below cushion-forming plants. Our findings highlight that soil hydraulic properties differ among vegetation types, and show the significance of vegetation types for soil hydrology.

AB Transpiration is an important component of soil water storage and stream-flow and is linked with ecosystem productivity, species distribution, and ecosystem health. In mountain environments, complex topography creates heterogeneity in key controls on transpiration as well as logistical challenges for collecting representative measurements. In these settings, ecosystem models can be used to account for variation in space and time of the dominant controls on transpiration and provide estimates of transpiration patterns and their sensitivity to climate variability and change. The Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys) model was used to assess elevational differences in sensitivity of transpiration rates to the spatiotemporal variability of climate variables across the Upper Merced River watershed, Yosemite Valley, California, USA. At the basin scale, predicted annual transpiration was lowest in driest and wettest years, and greatest in moderate precipitation years (R-2 = 0.32 and 0.29, based on polynomial regression of maximum snow depth and annual precipitation, respectively). At finer spatial scales, responsiveness of transpiration rates to climate differed along an elevational gradient. Low elevations (1200-1800 m) showed little interannual variation in transpiration due to topographically controlled high soil moistures along the river corridor. Annual conifer stand transpiration at intermediate elevations (1800-2150 m) responded more strongly to precipitation. resulting in a unimodal relationship between transpiration and precipitation where highest transpiration occurred during moderate precipitation levels, regardless of annual air temperatures. Higher elevations (2150-2600 m) maintained this trend, but air temperature sensitivities were greater. At these elevations, snowfall provides enough moisture for growth, and increased temperatures influenced transpiration. Transpiration at the highest elevations (2600-4000 m) showed strong sensitivity to air temperature. little sensitivity to precipitation. Model results suggest elevational differences in vegetation water use and sensitivity to climate were significant and will likely play a key role in controlling responses and vulnerability of Sierra Nevada ecosystems to climate change.

AB Riparian vegetation is important for stream functioning and as a major landscape feature. For many riparian plants, shallow groundwater is an important source of water, particularly in areas where rainfall is low, either annually or seasonally, and when extended dry conditions prevail for all or part of the year. The nature of tree water relationships is highly complex. Therefore, we used multiple lines of evidence to determine the water sources used by the dominant tree species Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river red gum), growing in riparian and floodplain areas with varying depth to groundwater and stream perenniality. Dendrometer bands were used to measure diel, seasonal, and annual patterns of tree water use and growth. Water stable isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in plant xylem, soil water, and groundwater were measured to determine spatial and temporal patterns in plant water source use. Our results indicated riparian trees located on relatively shallow groundwater had greater growth rates, larger diel responses in stem diameter, and were less reactive to extended dry periods, than trees in areas of deep groundwater. These results were supported by isotope analysis that suggested all trees used groundwater when soil water stores were depleted at the end of the dry season, and this was most pronounced for trees with shallow groundwater. Trees may experience more frequent periods of water deficit stress and undergo reduced productivity in scenarios where water table accessibility is reduced, such as drawdown from groundwater pumping activities or periods of reduced rainfall recharge. The ability of trees to adapt to changing groundwater conditions may depend on the speed of change, the local hydrologic and soil conditions as well as the species involved. Our results suggest that E. camaldulesis growing at our study site is capable of utilizing groundwater even to depths >10 m, and stream perenniality is likely to be a useful indicator of riparian tree use of groundwater.

AB The Arctic hydrologic cycle is intensifying, as evidenced by increased rates of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and riverine discharge. However, the controls on water fluxes from terrestrial to aquatic systems in upland Arctic landscapes are poorly understood. Upland landscapes account for one third of the Arctic land surface and are often drained by zero-order geomorphic flowpath features called water tracks. Previous work in the region attributed rapid runoff response at larger stream orders to water tracks, but models suggest water tracks are hydrologically disconnected from the surrounding hillslope. To better understand the role of water tracks in upland landscapes, we investigated the surface and subsurface hydrologic responses of 6 water tracks and their hillslope watersheds to natural patterns of rainfall, soil thaw, and drainage. Between storms, both water track discharge and the water table in the hillslope watersheds exhibited diel fluctuations that, when lagged by 5hr, were temporally correlated with peak evapotranspiration rate. Water track soils remained saturated for more of the summer season than soils in their surrounding hillslope watersheds. When rainfall occurred, the subsurface response was nearly instantaneous, but the water tracks took significantly longer than the hillslopes to respond to rainfall, and longer than the responses previously observed in nearby larger order Arctic streams. There was also evidence for antecedent soil water storage conditions controlling the magnitude of runoff response. Based on these observations, we used a broken stick model to test the hypothesis that runoff production in response to individual storms was primarily controlled by rainfall amount and antecedent water storage conditions near the water track outlet. We found that the relative importance of the two factors varied by site, and that water tracks with similar watershed geometries and at similar landscape positions had similar rainfall-runoff model relationships. Thus, the response of terrestrial water fluxes in the upland Arctic to climate change depends on the non-linear interactions between rainfall patterns and subsurface water storage capacity on hillslopes. Predicting these interactions across the landscape remains an important challenge.

AB Radar-based estimates of rainfall are affected by many sources of uncertainties, which would propagate through the hydrological model when radar rainfall estimates are used as input or initial conditions. An elegant solution to quantify these uncertainties is to model the empirical relationship between radar measurements and rain gauge observations (as the ground reference'). However, most current studies only use a fixed and uniform model to represent the uncertainty of radar rainfall, without consideration of its variation under different synoptic regimes. Wind is such a typical weather factor, as it not only induces error in rain gauge measurements but also causes the raindrops observed by weather radar to drift when they reach the ground. For this reason, as a first attempt, this study introduces the wind field into the uncertainty model and designs the radar rainfall uncertainty model under different wind conditions. We separate the original dataset into three subsamples according to wind speed, which are named as WDI (0-2m/s), WDII (2-4m/s) and WDIII (>4m/s). The multivariate distributed ensemble generator is introduced and established for each subsample. Thirty typical events (10 at each wind range) are selected to explore the behaviours of uncertainty under different wind ranges. In each time step, 500 ensemble members are generated, and the values of 5th to 95th percentile values are used to produce the uncertainty bands. Two basic features of uncertainty bands, namely dispersion and ensemble bias, increase significantly with the growth of wind speed, demonstrating that wind speed plays a considerable role in influencing the behaviour of the uncertainty band. On the basis of these pieces of evidence, we conclude that the radar rainfall uncertainty model established under different wind conditions should be more realistic in representing the radar rainfall uncertainty. This study is only a start in incorporating synoptic regimes into rainfall uncertainty analysis, and a great deal of more effort is still needed to build a realistic and comprehensive uncertainty model for radar rainfall data.

AB Following the statistical analyses of long-term rainfall-runoff records from research basins in humid temperate latitudes, Hewlett and co-workers extended the global challenge to disprove their findings that rainfall intensity was non-significant. This paper responds to Hewlett's challenge as no preceding analyses have involved forested basins in a tropical cyclone-prone area. Based on a 7 year rainfall-runoff record, quickflow (QF), peak flow (QP) and quickflow response ratios (QRR) were regressed as dependent variables against rainfall parameters (intensity, P-i, amount, P), storm duration, D and antecedent flow, I. These data sets were categorised into total streamflow (Q) classes and stratified into three seasons, (monsoon, post-monsoon and dry) for forested and cleared catchments. Where rainfall variable collinearity met acceptable levels, the addition of Pi to regression models including P, D, I contributed up to 9% and 66% of the respective variations in quickflow and peak flow. For the highest Q storm classes (monsoon), P-i alone accounted for up to 67% and 91% of the variation in Q(F) and Q(P) respectively and was the dominant influence on QP for all seasons. The very high rainfall intensities experienced in the monsoon season is a causal factor why these results differ from those of other research drainage basins. Surprisingly, P-i continued to have a significant influence on Q(F) for dry season classes when less-intense rainfall occurs. Further the results were similar for both catchments across all seasons. P was the dominant independent variable affecting Q(F) above a threshold Q of 50 mm (monsoon), as rainfall contributes directly to saturation overland flow and return flow under saturated conditions. Further although QRR increased with increasing Q for each season, the regression results for that parameter were poor possibly due to the non-linearity of the rainfall-runoff relationship.

AB Research over the last decade has shown that the suspended sediment loads of many rivers are dominated by composite particles. These particles are also known as aggregates or flocs, and are commonly made up of constituent mineral particles, which evidence a wide range of grain sizes, and organic matter. The resulting in situ or effective particle size characteristics of fluvial suspended sediment exert a major control on all processes of entrainment, transport and deposition. The significance of composite suspended sediment particles in glacial meltwater streams has, however, not been established. Existing data on the particle size characteristics of suspended sediment in glacial meltwaters relate to the dispersed mineral fraction (absolute particle size), which, for certain size fractions, may bear little relationship to the effective or in situ distribution. Existing understanding of composite particle formation within freshwater environments would suggest that in-stream flocculation processes do not take place in glacial meltwater systems because of the absence of organic binding agents. However, we report preliminary scanning electron microscopy data for one Alpine and two Himalayan glaciers that show composite particles are present in the suspended sediment load of the meltwater system. The genesis and structure of these composite particles and their constituent grain size characteristics are discussed. We present evidence for the existence of both aggregates, or composite particles whose features are largely inherited from source materials, and flocs, which represent composite particles produced by in-stream flocculation processes. In the absence of organic materials, the latter may result solely from electrochemical flocculation in the meltwater sediment system. This type of floc formation has not been reported previously in the freshwater fluvial environment. Further work is needed to test the wider significance of these data and to investigate the effective particle size characteristics of suspended sediment associated with high concentration outburst events. Such events make a major contribution to suspended sediment fluxes in meltwater streams and may provide conditions that are conducive to composite particle formation by flocculation.

AB The source and hydrochemical makeup of a stream reflects the connectivity between rainfall, groundwater, the stream, and is reflected to water quantity and quality of the catchment. However, in a semi-arid, thick, loess covered catchment, temporal variation of stream source and event associated behaviours are lesser known. Thus, the isotopic and chemical hydrographs in a widely distributed, deep loess, semi-arid catchment of the northern Chinese Loess Plateau were characterized to determine the source and hydrochemical behaviours of the stream during intra-rainfall events. Rainfall and streamflow were sampled during six hydrologic events coupled with measurements of stream baseflow and groundwater. The deuterium isotope (H-2), major ions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, and Na+) were evaluated in water samples obtained during rainfall events. Temporal variation of H-2 and Cl- measured in the groundwater and stream baseflow prior to rainfall was similar; however, the isotope compositions of the streamflow fluctuated significantly and responded quickly to rainfall events, likely due to an infiltration excess, overland dominated surface runoff during torrential rainfall events. Time source separation using H-2 demonstrated greater than 72% on average, the stream composition was event water during torrential rainfall events, with the proportion increasing with rainfall intensity. Solutes concentrations in the stream had loglinear relationships with stream discharge, with an outling anomaly with an example of an intra-rainfall event on Oct. 24, 2015. Stream Cl- behaved nonconservative during rainfall events, temporal variation of Cl- indicated a flush and washout at the onset of small rainfall events, a dilution but still high concentration pattern in high discharge and old water dominated in regression flow period. This study indicates rainfall intensity affects runoff responses in a semi-arid catchment, and the stored water in the thick, loess covered areas was less connected with stream runoff. Solute transport may threaten water quality in the area, requiring further analysis of the performance of the eco-restoration project.

AB The aluminium (Al) cycle in glacierised basins has not received a great deal of attention in studies of biogeochemical cycles. As Al may be toxic for biota, it is important to investigate the processes leading to its release into the environment. It has not yet been ascertained whether filterable Al (passing through a pore size of 0.45 mu m) is incorporated into biogeochemical cycles in glacierised basins. Our study aims to determine the relationship between the processes bringing filterable Al and glacier-derived filterable nutrients (particularly Fe and Si) into glacierised basins. We investigated the Werenskioldbreen basin (44.1 km(2), 60% glacierised) situated in SW Spitsbergen, Svalbard. In 2011, we collected meltwater from a subglacial portal at the glacier front and at a downstream hydrometric station throughout the ablation season. The Al concentration, unchanged between the subglacial system and proglacial zone, reveals that aluminosilicate weathering is a dominant source of filterable Al under subglacial conditions. By examining the Al:Fe ratio compared with pH and the sulphate mass fraction index, we found that the proton source for subglacial aluminosilicate weathering is mainly associated with sulphide oxidation and, to a lesser degree, with hydrolysis and carbonation. In subglacial outflows and in the glacial river, Al and Fe are primarily in the forms of Al(OH)(4)(-) and Fe(OH)(3). The annual filterable Al yield (2.7 mmol m(-2)) was of a magnitude similar to that of nutrients such as filterable Fe (3.0 mmol m(-2)) and lower than that of dissolved Si (18.5 mmol m(-2)). Our results show that filterable Al concentrations in meltwater are significantly correlated to filterable and dissolved glacier-derived nutrients (Fe and Si, respectively) concentrations in glaciers worldwide. We conclude that a potential bioavailable Al pool derived from glacierised basins may be incorporated in biogeochemical cycles, as it is strongly related to the concentrations and yields of glacier-derived nutrients.

AB The onset of snowmelt in the upper Yukon River basin, Canada, can be derived from brightness temperatures (T-b) obtained by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) on NASA's Aqua satellite. This sensor, with a resolution of 14 x 8 km 2 for the 36.5 GHz frequency, and two to four observations per day, improves upon the twice-daily coverage and 37 x 28 km 2 spatial resolution of the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I). The onset of melt within a snowpack causes an increase in the average daily 36.5 GHz vertically polarized T-b as well as a shift to high diurnal amplitude variations (DAV) as the snow melts during the day and re-freezes at night. The higher temporal and spatial resolution makes AMSR-E more sensitive to sub-daily T-b oscillations, resulting in DAV that often show a greater daily range compared to SSM/I. Therefore, thresholds of T-b > 246 K and DAV > 10 K developed for use with SSM/I have been adjusted for detecting the onset of snowmelt with AMSR-E using ground-based surface temperature and snowpack wetness relationships. Using newly developed thresholds of T-b > 252 K and DAV > 18 K, AMSR-E derived snowmelt onset correlates well with SSM/I observations in the small subarctic Wheaton River basin through the 2004 and 2005 winter/spring transition. In addition, the onset of snowmelt derived from AMSR-E data gridded at a higher resolution than the SSM/I data indicates that finer-scale differences in elevation and land cover affect the onset of snowmelt and are detectable with the AMSR-E sensor. On the basis of these observations, the enhanced resolution of AMSR-E is more effective than SSM/I at delineating spatial and temporal snowmelt dynamics in the heterogeneous terrain of the upper Yukon River basin.

AB This paper describes a meta-analysis conducted to estimate relationships between the nonuse components of WTP for surface water quality improvements and a combination of resource, context, and study design attributes, where these attributes include estimated use values for identical improvements. Results are contrasted across four different statistical approaches: ordinary least squares, weighted least squares, multilevel models, and simultaneous equation models. Findings illustrate robust, systematic relationships between a variety of attributes and estimated nonuse WTP, in addition to a systematic empirical relationship between use and nonuse values. Results are promising with regard to the ability of meta-analysis to synthesize information regarding nonuse WTP for water quality improvements and to reveal relationships unapparent from individual stated preference models.

AB Variable retention harvest (VRH) is a silvicultural approach that retains differing proportions and patterns of canopy trees across a harvested area to emulate natural disturbance effects on stand structure and enhance the resilience of the regenerating stand to abiotic and biotic stresses. Four VRH treatments were applied to an 83-year-old red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantation forest in the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone of Canada that included 55% aggregate retention (55A), 55% dispersed retention (55D), 33% aggregate retention (33A), 33% dispersed retention (33D) and an unharvested control (CN). In the sixth growing season after harvest, tree stem sap flow and eddy covariance flux measurements were used to examine the impacts of VRH on the dominant components of total stand evapotranspiration (ET), i.e., canopy transpiration (T-C) and water flux from the understory vegetation and soil (ETU) as well as understory and canopy water use efficiency (WUE). A positive relationship was found between harvest intensity and the growth of understory vegetation and ETU. The contribution of ETU to ET was higher in the dispersed compared to the aggregate VRH treatments. Canopy transpiration contributed 83% of ET in the CN plot and 58%, 55%, 30% and 23% in the 55D, 55A, 33A and 33D treatments, respectively. Overall, VRH treatments resulted in increased canopy WUE but little comparative effect on understory WUE. Our results suggest that the dispersed retention pattern led to higher ET and productivity than the aggregate pattern of the same retention level. Where carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation is the primary management objective, higher retention levels such as 55D might be used to favour stand level carbon storage while accepting slower rates of understory development. Our findings on the effects of VRH on productivity and WUE of the canopy and understory will help forest managers to better employ VRH as an option to meet multiple objectives and adapt forests to a warmer, more variable climate.

AB The understanding of the hydrology of plain basins may be improved by the combined analysis of rainfall-run-off records and remote sensed surface moisture data. Our work evaluates the surface moisture area (SMA) produced during rainfall-run-off events in a plain watershed of the Argentine Pampas Region, and studies which hydrological variables are related to the generated SMA. The study area is located in the upper and middle basins of the Del Azul stream, characterized by the presence of small gently hilly areas surrounded by flat landscapes. Data from 9 rainfall-run-off events were analysed. MODIS surface reflectance data were processed to calculate SMA subsequent to the peak discharge (post-SMA), and previous to the rainfall events (prev-SMA), to consider the antecedent wetness. Rainfall-run-off data included total precipitation depth (P), maximum intensity of rainfall over 6 hr (I6max), surface runoff registered between the beginning of the event and the day previous to the analysed MODIS scene (R), peak flow (Qp), and flood intensity (IF). In contrast with other works, post-SMA showed a negative relationship with the R. Three groups of cases were identified: (a) Events of low I6max, high prev-SMA, and low R were associated with slow and weakly channelized flow over plain areas, leading to saturated overland flow (SOF), with large SMA; (b) events of high I6max, low prev-SMA, and medium to high R were rapidly transported along the gentle slopes of the basin, related to Hortonian overland flow (HOF) and low post-SMA; and (c) events of medium to high I6max and prev-SMA with medium R were related to heterogeneous input-antecedent-run-off conditions combined: Local spatial conditions may have produced HOF or SOF, leading to an averaged response with medium SMA. The interactions between the geomorphology of the basin, the characteristics of the events, and the antecedent conditions may explain the obtained results. This analysis is relevant for the general knowledge of the hydrology of large plains, whose functioning studies are still in their early stages.

AB Soil salinization can occur in many regions of the world. Soil sodicity affects rainfall-runoff relationships and related erosion processes considerably. We investigated sodicity effects on infiltration, runoff and erosion processes on sodic soil slopes for two soils from China under simulated rainfall. Five sodicity levels were established in a silt loam and a silty clay with clay contents of 8.5% and 46.0%, respectively. The soils, packed in 50 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm flumes at two slope gradients (22 degrees and 35 degrees), were exposed to 60 min of simulated rainfall (deionized water) at a constant intensity of 125 mm h(-1). Results showed that, for both soils, increasing soil sodicity had some significant effects on hydrological processes, reducing the infiltration coefficient (pr = -0.69, P < 0.01) and the quasi-steady final infiltration rate (pr = -0.80, P < 0.01), and increasing the mean sediment loss (pr = 0.39, P < 0.05); however, it did not significantly affect the cumulative rainfall to ponding (P > 0.05). Moreover, increasing sodicity significantly increased the Reynolds number and the stream power (pr = 0.78 and 0.66, P < 0.01, respectively) of the runoff, decreased Manning roughness and Darcy-Weisbach coefficient (pr = -0.52 and -0.52, P < 0.05, respectively), but did not significantly affect the mean flow velocity, mean flow depth, Froude number and hydraulic shear stress. Stream power was shown to be the most sensitive hydraulic variable affecting sediment loss for both soils. Furthermore, as sodicity increased, the values of critical stream power decreased for both the silt loam (R-2 = 0.29, P < 0.05) and the silty clay (R-2 = 0.49, P < 0.05). The findings of this study were applied to a real situation and identified some negative effects that can occur with increasing sodicity levels. This emphasized the importance of addressing the influences of soil sodicity in particularly high risk situations and when predicting soil and water losses.

AB Changes in volume and pore space induced by the shrink-swell behavior of clay minerals present a challenge to predictive modeling of hydraulic properties of clayey soils. Despite well-developed theory for crystalline and osmotic swelling of clay minerals at the scale of individual clay lamellae, their translation to prediction of hydraulic properties of swelling soils is limited. In this study we propose a framework that combines physico-chemical processes with pore scale geometrical, hydrostatic, and hydrodynamic considerations toward prediction of constitutive hydraulic relationships for swelling porous media. Variations in pore space are modeled by considering the soil clay fabric as an assembly of colloidal-size tactoids with lamellar structure. The arrangement of clay tactoids and the spacing between individual lamellae are functions of primarily clay hydration state quantifiable via the disjoining pressure that is dominated by a large electrostatic repulsive component. Solution chemistry and clay type are also considered. Silt and sand textural constituents are represented as rigid spheres interspaced by clay fabric in two basic configurations of 'expansive' and 'reductive' unit cells. Bulk soil properties such as clay content, porosity and surface area serve as constraints for the pore-space geometry. Liquid saturation within the idealized pore space is calculated as a function of chemical potential considering volume changes due to clay shrink-swell behavior. Closed-form expressions for prediction of saturated hydraulic conductivity are derived from calculations of average flow velocities in ducts and between parallel plates, and invoking proportionality between water flux density and unit hydraulic gradient. Preliminary model calculations compare favorably with published data, and show great potential for upscaling considerations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Macropores connecting surface soils to tile drains can alter water and nutrient transport through the subsurface. In this study, laboratory rainfall simulations with artificial macropores combined with edge-of-field monitoring were used to evaluate surface-to-tile drain connectivity and phosphorus (P) transport as a function of antecedent moisture conditions. Laboratory rainfall simulations using repacked soil boxes with different macropore layouts (i.e., no macropore, surface-connected macropores, and disconnected macropores) were used to examine changes in water sources and flow pathways to tile drains with varying degrees of connectivity and antecedent wetness. Water, tracer, and P fluxes from a tile-drained field were also monitored to quantify linkages among water flow pathways, antecedent wetness, and P delivery to tile drains. Both laboratory and field results showed that surface-to-tile drain connectivity was important for water transport through the subsurface under both dry and wet antecedent conditions. When soil conditions were dry, discharge was minimal and primarily comprised of event water that bypassed the soil matrix. Increasing wetness resulted in similar event water transport, but greater mobilization of stored pre-event water and greater discharge; thus, the dominant source of tile water and the magnitude of tile discharge were substantially altered with changing antecedent moisture. Field data revealed that changes in drainage water source and discharge with increasing wetness impacted dissolved P transport. Dissolved P concentration decreased and loading increased with increasing wetness. Findings indicate that greater mobilization of pre-event water under wet antecedent conditions acted as both a hydrologic and chemical buffer for subsurface dissolved P transport. Comparison of study results to water quality data from a larger edge-of-field network suggest that relationships between antecedent moisture conditions, water flow pathways, and P transport from the current study are broadly applicable across tile-drained fields. Understanding processes controlling P delivery to tile drains has direct applicability for conservation practice implementation and improving process representation in models.

AB Hydrologic regime plays an important role in maintaining aquatic ecosystem structures and biogeochemical processes of endorheic salt lakes. Due to joint influences of regional climate change, runoff regulation and water withdrawal, ecological water deficiency has been increasingly prominent in endorheic salt lakes in Northwest China, especially in the Inner Mongolian Plateau. Previous studies mainly focused on establishing and applying methods to determine ecological water levels of lakes, while much less attention was paid to a more important problem - how such water levels could be reached under changed watershed hydrological processes. Solutions of this gap were explored in this study using the Dalinuoer Lake as an example. This lake is a typical endorheic salt lake located in the Inner Mongolian Plateau. It is a critical source to provide important ecological services and economic values for locals. Its ecological water level to maintain the optimum salinity threshold was first calculated by applying a statistical analysis of relationships between the phytoplankton biomass, salinity and water level of the lake. Potential measures to preserve the ecological water level of the lake were subsequently evaluated based on a hydrological process analysis of the watershed. The results indicated that the optimum salinity threshold was 5.7 g/L. This value should be also valid for other endorheic salt lakes in this region. According to a function between the water storage and the mean water depth of this lake, the ecological water level was determined to be 10.28 m with an ecological water deficit of 2.5 x 10(8) m(3). A basin water balance analysis using the results proposed measures to maintain a sustainable ecological water level, including controlling local water consumption and infusing ecological water. The results of this study could be extrapolated to other similar conditions to provide guidance for policy-makers, so that better decisions could be hopefully forged to protect eco-hydrological processes of endorheic salt lakes in the Mongolian Plateau, as well as other comparable scenarios.

AB Reservoirs are an integral component of water resources planning and management. Periodic and accurate assessment of the water storage change in reservoirs is an extraordinarily important aspect for better watershed management and water resources development. In view of the shortcomings of conventional approaches in locating reservoirs' spatial location and quantifying their storage, the remote sensing technique has several advantages, either for a single reservoir or for a group of reservoirs. The satellite-based remote sensing data, encompassing spatial, spectral and temporal attributes, can provide high-resolution synoptic and repetitive information with short time intervals on a large scale. Using remote sensing images in conjunction with Google Earth and field check of representative reservoirs, the spatial distribution of constructed reservoirs in the Yellow River basin was delineated, and their storage volume and the residence time of the stored water were estimated. The results showed that 2816 reservoirs were extracted from the images, accounting for 89.5% of the registered total. All large- and medium-sized reservoirs were extracted while small reservoirs may not be extracted due to coarse resolution and cloud-cover shadows. An empirical relationship between the extracted water surface area and the compiled storage capacity of representative reservoirs was developed. The water storage capacity was estimated to be 66.71 km3, about 92.7% of the total storage capacity reported by the authority. Furthermore, the basin was divided into 10 sub-basins upon which the water's residence time was analysed. The water discharge in the basin has been greatly regulated. The residence time has surged to 3.97 years in recent years, ranking the Yellow River in the top three of the list in terms of residence time and flow regulation among large river systems in the world. It is expected that it will be further extended in future owing to decreasing water discharge and increasing reservoir storage capacity. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The near-stream zone has received increasing attention owing to its influence on stream water chemistry in general and acidity in particular. Possible processes in this zone include cation exchange, leaching of organic matter and redox reactions of sulphur compounds. III this study the influences of processes in the near-stream zone on the acidity in runoff from a small, acidified catchment in central southern Sweden were investigated. The study included sampling of groundwater, soil water and stream water along with hydrological measurements. An input-output budget for the catchment was established based on data from the International Go-operative Programme on Integrated Monitoring at this site.
   The catchment was heavily acidified by deposition of anthropogenic sulphur, with pH in stream water between 4.4 and 4.6. There was also no relationship between stream flow and pH, which is indicative of chronic acidification. Indications of microbial reduction of sulphate were found in some places near the stream, but the near-stream zone did not have a general impact on the sulphate concentration in discharging groundwater. The near-stream zone was a source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the stream, which had a median DOC of 6.8 mg L-1. The influence on stream acidity from organic anions was overshadowed by the effect of sulphate, however, except during a spring flow episode, when additional organic matter was flushed out and the sulphate-rich ground water was mixed with more diluted event water. Ion exchange was not an important process in the near-stream zone of the Kindla catchment. Different functions of the near-stream zone relating to discharge acidity are reported in the literature. In this study there was even a variation within the site. There is therefore a need for more case studies to provide a more detailed understanding of the net effects that the near-stream zone can have on stream chemistry under different circumstances.

AB A fundamental prerequisite of any remedial activity is a sound knowledge of both the biotic and abiotic processes involved in transport and degradation of contaminants. Investigations of these aspects in situ often seem infeasible due to the complexity of interacting processes. A simplified portrayal of nature can be facilitated in laboratory-based two-dimensional (2D) sediment flow-through microcosms. This paper describes the versatility of such simple aquifer model systems with respect to biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons, i.e. toluene and ethylbenzene, under various environmental conditions. Initially constructed to study non-reactive and bioreactive transport of organic contaminants in homogeneous porous media under steady state hydraulic conditions, experimental setups developed towards more realistic heterogeneous sediment packing and transient hydraulic conditions. High-resolution spatial and temporal sampling allowed to obtain new insights on the distribution of bioactivities in contaminant plumes and associated controlling and limiting factors. Major biodegradation activities in saturated porous sediments are located at the fringes of contaminant plumes and are driven by dispersive mixing. These hot-spots of contaminant biotransformation are characterized by steep physical-chemical gradients in the millimeter to centimeter range. Sediment heterogeneity, i.e. high-conductivity zones, was shown to significantly enhance transverse mixing and subsequently biodegradation. On the contrary, transient hydraulic conditions may generate intermediate disturbances to biodegrader populations and thus may interfere with optimized contaminant conversion. However, a bacterial strain aerobically degrading toluene, i.e. Pseudomonas putida F1, was shown to adapt to vertically moving contaminant plumes, in the way that it regained full biodegradation potential two-times faster in areas with a midterm (days to weeks) contamination history than in areas not contaminated before. The 2D flow-through microcosms facilitated to combine a number of physicochemical and microbiological methods, such as high-resolution non-invasive oxygen measurements, conservative tracer tests, compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and numerical transport modelling, to name a few. Moreover, due to the defined and well-controlled operating conditions, these bench-scale flow-through systems allow to investigate theoretical concepts and to develop and test predictive models. They represent a valuable tool in helping to bridge the current knowledge gap concerning transport and degradation of contaminants in groundwater from the small-scale (i.e. oversimplified batch systems, disregarding transport processes) to the highly complex field conditions. The promising potential of applications is by far not exhausted. Further possibilities include testing ecological theories such as the resource-ratio theory, island biogeography, area-species richness relationships and relations between community structure, microbial abundance and process rates as well as the importance and effects of bacterial chemotaxis.

AB Pumping stations play an important role in flood mitigation in metropolitan areas. The existing sewerage systems, however, are facing a great challenge of fast rising peak flow resulting from urbanization and climate change. It is imperative to construct an efficient and accurate operating prediction model for pumping stations to simulate the drainage mechanism for discharging the rainwater in advance. In this study, we propose two rule-based fuzzy neural networks, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and counterpropagation fuzzy neural network for on-line predicting of the number of open and closed pumps of a pivotal pumping station in Taipei city up to a lead time of 20 min. The performance of ANFIS outperforms that of CFNN in terms of model efficiency, accuracy, and correctness. Furthermore, the results not only show the predictive water levels do contribute to the successfully operating pumping stations but also demonstrate the applicability and reliability of ANFIS in automatically controlling the urban sewerage systems.

AB Applying a deterministic model to a system simulation often requires an assumption that the system input-output relationship should hold the whole event. However, this assumption does not apply for nonlinear time-variant systems which possible different outputs can be found due to the various input structures. In this study, a Decision Group Back-Propagation Network (DGBPN) is proposed to avoid the prediction risks inherent in deterministic Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPN) models. The DGBPN was combined with many BPN models. The number of BPN models was dependant on the length of the learning data. The operation process of the DGBPN allows each given input vector of model learning to stand for the scheme of the vector space where it is located, and then uses the output estimation ability to select a suitable BPN model for each given input vector scheme from the BPN model candidates as a representative BPN model (also a member of a decision group). The similarity of input vectors between the forecasting pattern (verification pattern) and model learning patterns was employed to select a BPN model from the DGBPN for forecasting. A flood hydrograph forecast was completed using this method. The model developed in this study not only provides the flexibility necessary for a deterministic BPN model to cope with the volatility of the rainfall-runoff process, but also improves adaptability to reduce estimation error when a system input vector over the range of modeling is encountered. The study concludes with implications for theory, research, and practice. The DGBPN performed well and produced fair forecasting results in verification tests at the Wu-Shi watershed in Taiwan.

By contrast, the problem of specifying model parameter surfaces is largely bounded within known physical error distributions. In this paper we thus investigate the impact of varying mesh resolution on a typical non-linear finite numerical solver. Specifically, a two-dimensional finite element code which solves the Shallow Water equations was used to simulate unsteady flows in a meandering compound channel. A range of different mesh resolutions and parameter surfaces were simulated to determine relative dominance and, unlike previous studies, the effect on both bulk flow and distributed outputs were analysed. The results showed a wide variation in performance for mesh discretizations which fulfilled traditional length scale-based construction. Mesh resolution effects were at least as important as a typical calibration parameter and model response was shown to be highly complex. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Groundwater dynamics play an important role in runoff generation and hydrologic connectivity between hillslopes and streams. We monitored a network of 14 shallow groundwater (GW) wells in a 3.2km(2) experimental catchment in the Scottish Highlands. Wells were placed in three contrasting landscape units with different hydropedological characteristics and different topographic positions relative to the stream network, encompassing a catena sequence from freely draining podzols on steeper hillslopes to increasingly thick peats (histosols) in the valley bottom riparian zone. GW dynamics were characterized by statistical analyses of water table fluctuations, estimation of variabilities in lag times and hysteresis response in relation to streamflow. The three landscape units had distinct storage-discharge relationships and threshold responses with a certain GW level above which lateral flow dominates. Steeper hillslopes with freely draining podzols were characterized by GW fluctuations of around 150cm in the underlying drift. GW usually showed peak response up to several hours after stream flow. During persistent wet periods the water table remained in the soil profile for short spells and connected shallow flow paths in the near surface horizons to the lower hillslopes. In the peaty gleys in the lower foot slopes, GW was characterized by a water table generally within 20cm of the soil surface, though at some locations this could fall to 50cm in extreme dry periods. GW responses were usually a few hours prior to the stream responses. In riparian peats, the water table was also usually less than 20cm deep and responded several hours before the stream. These riparian peat soils remain at, or very near saturation with near-continuous GW-surface water connectivity. In contrast, the steeper slopes remain disconnected for prolonged periods and need large recharge events to overcome storage thresholds. GW responses vary seasonally, and landscape controls on the spatial organization of GW dynamics are strongest at low flows and in small events. During wettest periods, limited storage and extensive saturation weaken such controls. This study demonstrated that montane catchments can have highly dynamic GW stores, which are important in generating both storm flows and baseflows. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Functional (regression) and cause-and-effect analytical methods were employed in the investigation of Factors controlling single-value sediment-discharge relationships for individual hydrological events in the Fraser River Basin. Of 1025 hydrological events identified in the 97 years of the 9-stations discharge record monitored by the Water Survey of Canada (1960-1988), 49 were associated with linear, non-linear (concave and convex) sediment rating curves. Analysis revealed that time of events offered a partial explanation for the occurrence of single-valued curves because events occurring in isolation or in quick succession did not always produce single-valued curves owing to variations in hydrograph characteristics and temporal and spatial peak attenuation factors. Hydrologically, linear and non-linear sediment rating curves were distinguished by the influence of preceding discharge or antecedent moisture, which tends to generate quick or delayed runoff, thereby causing rapid or slow increases in sediment concentration in concert with discharge changes. Hydraulically, linear curves were shown to be controlled by rates of stream bed scour (rising stage) similar to those for channel filling (falling stage); concave curves by rates of scouring (rising stage) similar to those of filling but different from those of rescouring (failing stage); and convex curves by rates of filling and scouring (rising stage) different from those of filling and rescouring (falling stages), all in relation to the timing of the exceedance of the threshold discharge for stream bed scour. Meteorologically, bed scour and fill approximately coincided with the timing of precipitation, if any, on the rising and/or falling stages under subzero (T less than or equal to 0 degrees C), low (1 less than or equal to T less than or equal to 9 degrees C) and moderate (10 less than or equal to T less than or equal to 19 degrees C) temperature conditions. It is concluded that a combination of temporal, spatial, hydrological, hydraulic and meteorological factors control variations in sediment concentration during single hydrological events on the Fraser River in a complex fashion. Multivariate analysis of these factors should greatly improve prediction of sediment transport in the Fraser River Basin. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Tree-ring-based reconstructions of paleo-hydrology have proved useful for better understanding the irregularities and extent of past climate changes, and therefore, for more effective water resources management. Despite considerable advances in the field, there still exist challenges that introduce significant uncertainties into paleo-reconstructions. This study outlines these challenges and address them by developing two themes: (1) the effect of temporal scaling on the strength of the relationship between the hydrologic variables, streamflow in this study, and tree growth rates and (2) the reconstruction uncertainty of streamflow due to the dissimilarity or inconsistency in the pool of tree-ring chronologies (predictors in reconstruction) in a basin. Based on the insight gained, a methodology is developed to move beyond only relying on the annual hydrology-growth correlations, and to utilize additional information embedded in the annual time series at longer time scales (e.g. multi-year to decadal time scales). This methodology also generates an ensemble of streamflow reconstructions to formally account for uncertainty in the pool of chronology sites. The major headwater tributaries of the Saskatchewan River Basin, the main source of surface water in the Canadian Prairie Provinces, are used as the case study. It is shown that the developed methodology explains the variance of streamflows to a larger extent than the conventional approach and better preserves the persistence and variability of streamflows across time scales (Hurst-type behaviour). The resulting ensemble of paleo-hydrologic time series is able to more credibly pinpoint the timing and extent of past dry and wet periods and provides a dynamic range of uncertainty in reconstruction. This range varies with time over the course of the reconstruction period, indicating that the utility of tree-ring chronologies for paleo-reconstruction differs for different time periods over the past several centuries in the history of the region. The proposed ensemble approach provides a credible range of multiple-century-long water availability scenarios that can be used for vulnerability assessment of the existing water infrastructure and improving water resources management.

AB The classic GA model assumes a constant-head ponded water and with a saturated water content above the wetting zone, which limits its application. This study investigated a semi-analytical method for predicting rainwater infiltration into an inclined soil interlayer considering time-varying head and stratified water content. An evolving wetting profile and a half-parabolic wetting profile of transient zone were observed during infil-tration process based on numerical simulations. The water head in the fissure showed a linearly-increasing characteristic before the soil interlayer was fully saturated, while showed an exponentially-increasing feature after the soil interlayer was fully saturated. A semi-analytical model was subsequently established for predicting the variables (time-dependent water head and the length of the stratified wetting zone) based on the classical GA equation, Darcy's law, and mass conversation law, as well as the numerical simulation calibration. This semi-analytical model describes three specific infiltration scenarios (scenarios I, II, and III) involving two infiltra-tion modes (i.e., rainfall infiltration and constant-head infiltration), which were comprehensively shaped by fissure height, rain intensity, and duration. This model has a concise expression satisfying dimensional consis-tency and can be successfully reduced to the classic GA model. The validity of this semi-empirical model was further confirmed by numerical simulations, which showed good performance by capturing the evolving trends of the water head, saturated, transitional, and wetting zones in the inclined soil interlayer. The results and findings deepen the understanding of transient infiltration in rock slopes with inclined soil interlayer, and are helpfully for assessing the evolving slope stability during rainfall.

AB Data for water quality surveys of effluent from sewage treatment works (STWs) in the rural Kennet/Dun sub-catchments of the upper Thames Basin are presented to characterize treated sewage effluent. Water quality determinand relationships with boron (B) are presented to provide information that can be used, with stream water quality information, to assess the relative inputs of treated sewage effluent pollutants to streams in rural areas. The approach is based on three points: (1) information on sewage effluent and agricultural pollution is of concern in relation to the management of UK lowland river systems in rural environments; (2) the lack of detailed information on sewage runoff chemistry and flow means that direct assessment of sewage effluent pollution to surface waters cannot be gauged; (3) B provides a clear chemically conservative marker of sewage sources in surface and ground waters. Three types of relationship to B were observed. Firstly, determinands such as Na, Cl, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and NO3 showed a positive linear relationship with B and there is a near zero intercept; these components are essentially derived from sewage sources. Secondly, Mg and SO4 show linear relationships with B, but there is a non-zero intercept; these components have both a sewage component and a background component linked to water supplies from surface and groundwater sources. Thirdly, there are deteriminands that show no relationship with boron. In this study, an erratic pattern was observed for ammonium. This probably reflects the variable removal of this pollutant from sewage sources. Near constant concentrations of components such as Ca and alkalinity, which come from the background aquifer sources, were also found. SRP and B relationships for rivers in the upper Thames Basin showed the potential importance of (a) removal processes in the stream/groundwater for SRP derived from STW effluent inputs and (b) tertiary P stripping at the STWs on river water SRP levels. The importance of agricultural sources of SRP is questioned. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biological control of Tamarix spp. (tamarisk) with Diorhabda spp. (tamarisk beetle) was initiated in several states in the Western United States in 2001. We analysed 12 years of evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem production (NEP), and beetle abundance data from a tamarisk-invaded site in Western Nevada along the Truckee River. Diorhabda carinulata (northern tamarisk beetle) appeared at the site in 2007. Large beetle outbreaks and associated defoliation of the tamarisk occurred in 2008 and 2009, then the beetle population was highly variable from year to year. Since 2016, the beetle population declined. Growing season ET noticeably declined from direct beetle herbivory in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but the decline in ET was seasonally transient as trees regrew leaves. In 2012 and 2013, total growing season ET was low, likely due to the combined effects of drought and beetle herbivory pressure. Total seasonal ET losses and NEP were primarily driven by annual precipitation with higher values in wetter years and reduced values when precipitation fell below 100 mm. In the last 2 years of the study, 2017-2018, there were few to no beetles observed at the site, and we measured increased tamarisk leaf area index, ET, and NEP. Since 2010 at the study site, no further releases of the beetles have occurred due to wildlife concerns, and subsequent declines in beetle populations where such that the "outbreak" conditions apparently required to impair tamarisk physiological function and significantly reduce ET have not occurred. ET and photosynthesis were highly correlated (r(2) >= .91) to the Landsat-satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Using a relationship between growing season ET and NDVI, we estimated ET for five additional tamarisk sites along several southwestern U.S. rivers. In the 2005 to 2018 analysis period, NDVI-estimated ET declined at all sites after beetle arrival with three sites showing a recovery in pre-beetle ET rates in subsequent years. At the other three sites, ET rates have not recovered to pre-beetle levels.

AB Vegetation cover plays an important role in linking the atmosphere, water, and land and is deemed as a key indicator in the terrestrial ecological system. Therefore, it is of great importance to monitor vegetation dynamics and understand the mechanisms of vegetation change, including that driven by climate change. This study examines (a) the evolution of vegetation dynamics over the Heihe River Basin in the typical arid zone in north-western China using nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and Thiel Sen's slope; (b) the relationships between remotely sensed vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI] and enhanced vegetation index [EVI]) and hydroclimatic variables based on correlation analysis; and (c) the prediction of vegetation anomalies using a multiple linear regression model. For the analysis, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI/EVI product and the gridded daily meteorological data at a spatial resolution of 0.125 degrees over the period 2001-2010 are considered. The results indicate that vegetation cover improved over a large proportion during 2001-2010, with a significant trend towards warm and wet, characterized by an increase in average annual temperature and precipitation by 0.042 degrees C/year and 5.8mm/year, respectively. We test the feasibility of NDVI and EVI in quantifying the responses of vegetation anomaly to climate change and develop a statistical model to predict vegetation dynamics in the basin. The NDVI-based model is found to be more reliable than the EVI-based model, partly due to the vegetation characteristics and geomorphologic properties of the study region. The proposed model performs well when there is no lag time between meteorological factors and vegetation indices for grassland and cropland, whereas 1-month lead time prediction is found to be best for forest. The soil water content is introduced as an extra explanatory variable, which effectively improves the prediction accuracy for different land use types. In general, the predictive ability of the proposed model is stable and satisfactory, and the model can provide useful early warning information for regional water resources management under changing climate.

AB Accurate evapotranspiration (ET) estimation plays a central role in better understanding the allocation of water resources in a time of increasing scarcity; however, ET estimation remains many challenges. To enhance the accuracy of ET prediction, this study proposes an enhanced gross primary productivity (GPP)-based Priestley-Taylor algorithm (GPP-PT) that uses GPP to compute fractional vegetation cover (f(V)). In terms of soil moisture fraction (f(SM)), it is described by using either diurnal temperature (DT) or soil moisture index (SWI), conducting two variations of the proposed model (i.e., hereafter called GPP-DT and GPP-SWI, respectively). These two improved algorithms were compared with their previous models, the GPP-DT with a modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor model (MS-PT), and the GPP-SWI with a soil water index (SWI)-based Priestley-Taylor model (SWI-PT). Datasets from 42 flux towers covering different land cover types were used to investigate the performance of these algorithms. The GPP-DT algorithm was found to be superior to the MS-PT model, with 12.60% and 10.42% reductions in the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, and with 9.05% and 2.19% increases in the determination coefficient (R-2) and index of agreement (IOA), respectively. Similarly, the GPP-SWI model yielded RMSE and MAE reductions of 10.95% and 10.67%, respectively, and R-2 and IOA increases of 8.88% and 3.72%, respectively, compared to the SWI-PT model. In the direct comparison between the two newly proposed models, the GPP-DT model performed better in shrubland and forest, whereas the GPP-SWI model performed more efficiently in grassland. Sensitivity analysis found that soil moisture was more sensitive to both evaporation and transpiration than DT in most land cover types, and the GPP had a stable relationship with transpiration in different biomes. The newly improved GPP-PT models were robust and effective for estimating ET and might thus be used as a reliable input for hydrological models.

AB Assessing ecological restoration effects on hydrological regimes is important for water resources management, especially under semi-arid conditions. Here, the stability and long-term variability of streamflow components were analyzed for three less forested watersheds (LFWs, vegetation coverage 16-23% in 1970) undergoing major vegetation restoration (57-80% coverage in 2019), and for two largely forested watersheds (FWs, 65-68% cover in 1970 increasing to 88-92% in 2019) within the Beiluo River Basin on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Daily flow data for each watershed and year were normalized by rainfall to eliminate effects of non-stationary rainfall. Mean annual streamflow totals for the similar to 60-year study period were 25.1-34.1 and 21.6-48.1 mm y(-1) for the LFWs and FWs, respectively. Average contributions of baseflow to total streamflow were 32-44% for the LFWs and 58-61% for the FWs. Mann-Kendall tests showed significant decreasing trends for annual streamflow and stormflow (0.23-0.54% y(-1)) from the LFWs throughout. Mean streamflow from the LFWs between 2000 and 2019 decreased by 58% compared to the pre-2000 period, while the average contribution of stormflow decreased from 66% to 35% (2010s). However, winter baseflow increased with time since start of restoration. Conversely, streamflow (components) for the FWs showed only slight fluctuations in decadal, annual and seasonal trends. Both total streamflow and stormflow exhibited strong power relationships with vegetation coverage, illustrating a tendency towards stable flow regimes for vegetation coverage >60-70%. Large-scale vegetation restoration has fundamentally changed amounts and temporal distribution of streamflow (components) on the Loess Plateau mainly by regulating stormflow. After 20 years of restoration, the trend and proportion of streamflow components from the LFWs approximated those of the FWs. These results underpin the planning of sustainable management of natural resources vis-a-vis socio-economic development during long-term ecological restoration on the Loess Plateau.

AB Over the past 60 years, road deicers (i.e. road salt) have been applied to roadways in high latitudes to improve road conditions in winter weather. However, the dissolution of road deicers in highway runoff creates waters with high concentrations of sodium, which can mobilize soil metals via soil cation-exchange reactions. While several studies have detailed the interactions of road salt-rich solutions and surface and ground waters, less attention has been given to how local hydrologic flowpaths can impact the delivery of these solutions to near-road soils. Between 2013 and 2014, soil water samples were collected from a roadside transect of lysimeter nests in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA). Soil water samples were analysed for metal concentrations and resulting data used to examine cation dynamics. While patterns in soil water calcium and magnesium concentrations follow patterns in soil water sodium concentrations, additional processes influence patterns in soil water potassium concentrations. Specifically, we observe the highest calcium and magnesium concentrations in the deepest lysimeters, suggesting divalent cations are mobilized to, and potentially accumulate in, deeper soil horizons. In contrast, soil water potassium concentrations do not follow this pattern. Additionally, in all examined elements (Ca, Mg, K, Na, and Cl), the timing of concentration peaks appears be influenced by a combination of both distance from the roadside and sampling depth. These relationships not only suggest that multiple soil water flowpaths interact with our study transect but also confirm that road salt plumes persist and migrate following the road salting season. Characterizing the interactions of sodium-rich solutions and roadside soil cation pools clarifies our understanding of metal dynamics in the roadside environment. A deeper understanding of these processes is necessary to effectively restore and manage watersheds as high total dissolved solid solutions (e.g. road deicing melt, unconventional natural gas brines, and marginal irrigation water) continue to influence hydrological systems.

AB Prior to hydrologic modelling, topographic features of a surface are derived, and the surface is divided into sub-basins. Surface delineation can be described as a procedure, which leads to the quantitative rendition of surface topography. Different approaches have been developed for surface delineation, but most of them may not be applicable to depression-dominated surfaces. The main objective of this study is to introduce a new depression-dominated delineation (D-cubed) method and highlight its unique features by applying it to different topographic surfaces. The D-cubed method accounts for the hierarchical relationships of depressions and channels by introducing the concept of channel-based unit (CBU) and its connection with the concept of puddle-based unit (PBU). This new delineation method implements a set of new algorithms to determine flow directions and accumulations for puddle-related flats. The D-cubed method creates a unique cascaded channel-puddle drainage system based on the channel segmentation algorithm. To demonstrate the capabilities of the D-cubed method, a small laboratory-scale surface and 2 natural surfaces in North Dakota were delineated. The results indicated that the new method delineated different surfaces with and without the presence of depressional areas. Stepwise changes in depression storage and ponding area were observed for the 3 selected surfaces. These stepwise changes highlighted the dynamic filling, spilling, and merging processes of depressions, which need to be considered in hydrologic modelling for depression-dominated areas. Comparisons between the D-cubed method and other methods emphasized the potential consequences of use of artificial channels through the flats created by the depression-filling process in the traditional approaches. In contrast, in the D-cubed method, sub-basins were further divided into a number of smaller CBUs and PBUs, creating a channel-puddle drainage network. The testing of the D-cubed method also demonstrated its applicability to a wide range of digital elevation model resolutions. Consideration of CBUs, PBUs, and their connection provides the opportunity to incorporate the D-cubed method into different hydrologic models and improve their simulation of topography-controlled runoff processes, especially for depression-dominated areas.

AB Evaporation and heat transfer mechanisms differ for different types of soils. In this study, Evapotranspiration (ET) models for the bare soil, vegetation land, and the mixed regions were developed based on the Land Surface Energy Balance Theory. Surface energy fluxes and daily ET of the Heihe River Basin were estimated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data and meteorological observation data, including the daily duration time of the sun, air temperature, etc. based on the revised three-temperature model (3T model), and then the distribution maps of ET were retrieved. Thereafter, Evaporator pan (E-601) measurements obtained from meteorological observation stations in the study area were chosen to validate the accuracy of the calculated ET. Results showed that the maximum absolute error was 1.70 mm/d, whereas the minimum was 0.05 mm/d, which indicated that the revised 3T model was of adequate accuracy in estimating ET in the study area and could be extended to the regional scale. Also, the spatial distribution of surface ET was different in the upper, middle and lower reaches in the study area and fit with vegetation conditions. On the whole, the ET increased from desert of northeast to mountain of southwest. The results showed that the ET in the study area ranged from 0.06 to 7.00 mm/d, with an average value of 2.43 mm/d, on 2 August 2008. The highest ET values was from the forest or alpine meadow areas in the upper reaches, with more than 4 mm/d, the lowest values was from the Gobi desert in the lower reaches, with below 2 mm/d, and ET of oasis in the middle reaches was not only changed with the crop growth stage and vegetation conditions, but also controlled greatly by human activities, with more than 3.5 mm/d.

TI Carbon, nitrogen, and water stable isotopes in plant tissue and soils
   across a moisture gradient in Puerto Rico
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article; Data Paper
AB Stable isotopes in the water molecule (H-2 or D and O-18), carbon, and nitrogen are useful tracers and integrators of processes in plant ecohydrological systems across scales. Over the last few years, there has been growing interest in regional to continental scale synthesis of stable isotope data with a view to elucidating biogeochemical and ecohydrological patterns. Published datasets from the humid tropics, however, are limited. To be able to contribute to bridging the "data gap" in the humid tropics, here, we publish a relatively novel and unique suite of delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2, and delta O-18 isotope data from three sites across a moisture gradient and contrasting land use in Puerto Rico. Plant tissue (xylem and leaf) samples from two species of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla and Swietenia mahagoni) and soil samples down to 60 cm in the soil profile were collected in relatively "wet" (July 2012) and "dry" (February 2013) periods at two sites in northeastern (Luquillo) and southwestern (Susua) Puerto Rico. The same sampling suite is also being made available from a highly urbanized site in the capital San Juan. Leaf samples taken in July 2012 and February 2013 were analyzed for delta C-13 and delta N-15; all xylem and bulk soil samples were analyzed for d2H and d18O. Soil samples taken in July 2012 were analyzed for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Leaf delta N-15 and delta C-13 dataset showed patterns that are possibly associated with site differences. While spatial patterns were also apparent in soil delta N-15 and delta C-13 dataset, the positively linear delta N-15 - delta C-13 relationship tends to weaken with site moisture. Soil depth and site moisture patterns were also observed in the delta H-2 and delta O-18 datasets of bulk soil and xylem samples. The purpose of these datasets is to provide baseline information on soil- plant water (delta H-2 and delta O-18, N = 319), delta C-13 (N = 272), and delta N-15 (N = 269) that may be useful in a wide range of research questions from ecohydrological relations to biogeochemical patterns in soils and vegetation.

AB Acid drainage is an important water quality issue in Andean watersheds, affecting the sustainability of urban, agricultural, and industrial activities. Mixing zones receiving acid drainage are critical sites where changes in pH and chemical environment promote the formation and dissolution of iron and aluminum oxy/hydroxides. These particles can significantly change the speciation of toxic metals and metalloids throughout drainage networks via sorption, desorption, and settling processes. However, little is known about the behavior of particle size distributions (PSDs) in streams affected by acid drainage and their relationship to metal speciation. This work studied: (a) the PSDs for a wide range of mixing ratios found at a fluvial confluence affected by acid drainage, and (b) the response of PSDs and arsenic speciation to environmental changes found when the particles approach complete mixing conditions. The confluence between the Azufre River (pH similar to 2, high concentration of dissolved metals) and Caracarani River (pH = 8.6, low concentration of dissolved metals) was used as a representative model for study. Field measurements show a bimodal PSD with modal diameters of similar to 50 and 300 mu m. At shorter distances from the junction, the smaller modes with smaller particle volumes were dominant across the stream cross-sections. A systematic shift towards larger particle sizes and larger particle volumes occurred downstream. The analysis of laboratory PSDs for Azufre/Caracarani mixing ratios between 0.01 and 0.5 (pH from 6.2 to 2.3) showed a bimodal trend with similar to 15 and 50 mu m characteristic diameters; larger particles formed at pH>4. When particle suspensions were transferred in laboratory experiments from very low pH to full mixing conditions (pH similar to 2.8 and mixing ratio similar to 0.25) particle sizes varied, and the dissolved arsenic concentration decreased. The observed reaction kinetics were slow compared to the time scale of advective transport, creating opportunities for engineered controls for arsenic. This work contributes to a better understanding of the chemical-hydrodynamic interactions in watersheds affected by mining, and identifying opportunities to improve water quality at points of use.

AB The Surface Water and Ocean Topography Mission (SWOT) will generate global, spatially continuous maps of water surface elevation and extent for large inland water bodies when it launches in 2021. We present an analysis of water surface elevation, width, and bathymetry timeseries data from a medium-sized (average annual discharge 14 m(3)/s) river to explore Manning's equation, an empirical open channel flow equation, in the context of SWOT discharge algorithms. While this equation is in theory inapplicable to natural channels due to the non-uniform and spatially heterogeneous nature of river systems, we explored approaches to adapt it to this context using reach-averaged variables. At twenty sites along a 6.5 km stretch of the Olentangy River in Ohio, USA, we collected automated and manual measurements of water surface elevation and river width, undertook a full bathymetric survey of the study area, and built a hydraulic model. The stretch of river was divided into five reaches, and hydraulic variables were reach-averaged. Using these variables, we used a modified form of Manning's equation to compute a reach-averaged roughness coefficient. Reach-averaged roughness coefficients varied nonlinearly with discharge and were 2-10 times larger at low flow than at high flow in the in-situ data, ranging from 0.06 to 0.61 in one of the study reaches. These results were compared with the output of an unsteady flow simulation using a calibrated 1-D hydraulic model which was run with constant roughness coefficients at each cross section. When reach-averaged data was used, model-derived roughness coefficient also varied by more than an order of magnitude, with a range of 0.02-0.82 for one reach. For both in-situ and model-derived datasets, using a two-parameter roughness coefficient which scaled with a power law on either discharge or stage reduced discharge estimation error, with error for one reach dropping from 81% to 8% relative root-mean square error (rRMSE) in the in-situ data and 58% to 8% nRMSE in the modeled data. These results imply that spatial averaging of hydraulic variables leads to large variations in reach averaged Manning's n, which we term the reach's "effective resistance", and suggest that this variability can be accounted for with a simple parameterization in estimates of discharge that use spatially averaged data.

TI Finland's cooperation in managing transboundary waters and the UNECE
   Principles for Effective Joint Bodies: Value for water diplomacy?
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE UNECE principles; Joint bodies; Transboundary waters; Water agreements;
   Water diplomacy
AB Water diplomacy may be understood broadly as the measures that may be taken to prevent or peacefully resolve conflicts over water resources concerning their availability, allocation or use between and within states. The concept is preventive in nature as well as offering an approach for conflict resolution. Instruments of international water law, among them notably conventions and soft law developed on that basis - which promote equitable and reasonable use of transboundary waters and prevention of transboundary impact - can serve as tools for water diplomacy. The obligation to establish agreements on shared waters and joint bodies to govern them has contributed to gathering important experience, and some of this has been synthesized into the Principles for Effective Joint Bodies which were adopted by the Meeting of the Parties to the UNECE Water Convention in 2015. The Principles are intended as a resource to increase the effectiveness of joint bodies in transboundary water cooperation.
   This paper analyses Finland's cooperation arrangements in the light of the Principles and assesses the extent to which Finland's transboundary water commissions reflect the good practices specified in the Principles. Taking a wider perspective, the paper also examines the elements of the principles and their practical realisation with a view to understanding better their promotion of water diplomacy. Relevant features include, inter alia, the competency and representation of the joint institution, its accountability and the extent to which public participation is permitted, and the cooperative mechanisms in place. Naturally the underlying transboundary water agreements specify the framework for cooperation between the riparian states to a great extent, but the established joint bodies often play a significant role, specifically in the equitable use and management of the shared water resources, but even beyond, in the prevention and settling of conflicts, and in the general promotion of cooperation and security at a regional level.

AB Of particular importance in a world of increasing water scarcity is the temporal and spatial relationship between a shortage in rainfall-meteorological drought-and a shortage in available water, or hydrological drought. Propagation time from meteorological to hydrological drought should be calculated at a higher (sub-monthly) temporal resolution with considerations for spatial expansion. A new framework for propagation time calculation from one index to another is established that uses the run theory, high-resolution remote sensing data on a daily time step. The framework is demonstrated using standardized drought indices representing precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture in the Central Asian subcontinent to measure the temporal shift (propagation time) in affected drought area, bringing a new perspective to contemporary drought analysis. Several variables from the water cycle are chosen to provide hydrological context for different propagation times. Correlation analyses for propagation time are shown to be ambiguous in interpretation and precision when compared to the temporal shift, which is clearly defined and calculated on a daily time step. Moreover, the results of temporal shift analyses indicate that deficits in evapotranspiration and runoff can precede deficits in precipitation, while soil moisture deficit almost always follows, highlighting the effects of additional influencing factors aside from precipitation on types of hydrological drought. While it is limited by current understanding of drought definition techniques, availability and quality of remote sensing products, and selection of characteristics for observation, use of the temporal shift over the correlation analysis provides a sub-monthly estimate of drought propagation time that may prove useful for detailed analyses, particularly in rapidly developing flash drought events.

AB Hydrological and bioclimatic processes that lead to drought may stress plants and wildlife, restructure plant community type and architecture, increase monotypic stands and bare soils, facilitate the invasion of non-native plant species and accelerate soil erosion. Our study focuses on the impact of a paucity of Colorado River surface flows from the United States (U.S.) to Mexico. We measured change in riparian plant greenness and water use over the past two decades using remotely sensed measurements of vegetation index (VI), evapotranspiration (ET) and a new annualized phenology assessment metric (PAM) for ET. We measure these long-term (2000-2019) metrics and their short-term (2014-2019) response to an environmental, pulse flow in 2014, as prescribed under Minute 319 of the 1944 Water Treaty between the two nations. In subsequent years, small-directed flows were provided to restoration areas under Minute 323. We use 250 m MODIS and 30 m Landsat imagery to evaluate three vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, EVI2). We select EVI2 to parameterize an optical-based ET algorithm and test the relationship between ET from Landsat and MODIS by regression approaches. Our analyses show significant decreases in VIs and ET for both the 20-year and post-pulse 5-year periods. Over the last 20 years, EVI(Landsat)declined 34% (30% by EVIMODIS) and ET(Landsat-EVI)declined 38% (27% by ETMODIS-EVI), overall ca. 1.61 mm/day or 476 mm/year drop in ET; using PAM ET(Landsat-EVI)the drop was from 1130 to 654 mm/year. Over the 5 years since the 2014 pulse flow, EVI(Landsat)declined 20% (13% by EVIMODIS) and ET(Landsat-EVI)declined 23% (4% by ETMODIS-EVI) with a 0.77 mm/day or a 209 mm/year 5-year drop in ET; using PAM ET(Landsat-EVI)the drop was from 863 to 654 mm/year. Data and change maps show the pulse flow contributed enough water to slow the rate of loss, but only for the very short-term (1-2 years). These findings are critically important as they suggest further deterioration of biodiversity, wildlife habitat and key ecosystem services due to anthropogenic diversions of water in the U.S. and Mexico and from land clearing, fires and plant-related drought which affect hydrological processes.

AB Growing awareness of the wider environmental significance of fine sediment transport by rivers and associated sediment problems linked to sediment-water quality interactions, nutrient and contaminant transfer, and the degradation of aquatic habitats has resulted in the need for an improved understanding of the mobilization and transfer of sediment in catchments to support the development of effective sediment management strategies. The sediment budget provides a key integrating concept for assembling information on the internal functioning of a catchment in terms of its sediment dynamics by providing information on the mobilization, transfer, storage and output of sediment. One key feature of a catchment sediment budget is the relationship between the sediment yield at the catchment outlet and rates of sediment mobilization and transfer within the catchment, which is commonly represented by the sediment delivery ratio. To date, most attempts to derive estimates of this ratio have been based on a comparison of the measured sediment yield from a catchment with an estimate of the erosion occurring within the catchment, derived from an erosion prediction procedure, such as the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) or its revised version, RUSLE. There is a need to obtain more direct and spatially distributed evidence of the erosion rates occurring within a catchment and to characterize the links between sediment mobilization, transfer, storage and output more explicitly. In this context, fallout radionuclides have proved particularly useful as sediment tracers. This paper reports the results of a study aimed at exploring the use of caesium-137 (Cs-137) measurements to establish sediment budgets for three catchments of different sizes and contrasting land use located in Calabria, southern Italy. Long-term measurements of sediment output were available for the catchments, and, by using the estimates of gross and net rates of soil loss within the catchments provided by Cs-137 measurements, it was possible to establish the key components of the sediment budget for each catchment. By documenting the sediment budgets of three catchments of different sizes, the study provides a basis for exploring the effects of scale on catchment sediment budgets and, in particular, the increasing importance of catchment storage as the size of the catchment increases. The results of this study demonstrate a reduction in the sediment delivery ratio from 98 to 2% as catchment area increases from 1.47 ha to 31.2 km(2). Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A transformation of a Gaussian random field results in a change of the spatial dependence. In simple terms, the range and the shape of a variogram are different between an underlying Gaussian and a transformed Gaussian field. There is a relationship between the underlying and the transformed spatial dependence. This paper shows how this relationship can be expressed analytically. Rather than generating multidimensional random fields and conducting spatial statistical analysis, we develop an accurate and efficient approach based on a unique mapping of the correlation coefficients of the original multi-Gaussian fields to the transformed correlation coefficients to evaluate the spatial correlation of transformed non-Gaussian random fields for any type of geostatistical parameterization. Such a mapping can also yield accurate estimation of the spatial correlation of the underlying Gaussian field given the spatial correlation of the transformed field. Results indicate that (1) a nonlinear transformation of spatially distributed fields usually changes the spatial dependence structure; and (2) the relationship between the dependence structures of the underlying and the transformed field can be expressed analytically, and it is sufficient to do this in one dimension. We use the developed approach to investigate the change of correlations of connected random fields generated by the absolute-value transformation. Results show (1) the correlation lengths of the underlying Gaussian fields are 1.67 and 2.64 times of those of transformed non-Gaussian fields for Gaussian and exponential covariance models, respectively; (2) the anisotropic ratio does not change; and (3) the anticorrelation in hole-effect correlation models disappear.

AB The nature of the water-air temperature relationship, and its moderation by discharge, were investigated for catchments ranging in size from 2.1 to 601 km(2) in the Exe basin, Devon, UK and for data relating to hourly, daily and weekly time bases. The sensitivity and explanatory power of simple water-air temperature regression models based on hourly data were improved by incorporation of a lag, which increased with catchment size, although relationships became more sensitive and less scattered as the time base of data increased from hourly to weekly mean values. Significant departures from linearity in water-air temperature relationships were evident for hourly, but not for daily mean or weekly mean, data. A clear tendency for relationships between water and air temperatures to be stronger and more sensitive for flows below median levels was apparent, and multiple regression analysis also revealed water temperature to be inversely related to discharge for all catchments and time-scales. However, discharge had a greater impact in accounting for water temperature variation at shorter time-scales and in larger catchments. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Water resource managers depend on the collection of accurate hydrometric data for various modeling and planning projects. An essential use of hydrometric data includes hydrologic modelling and forecasting to support decision making in water resources planning and management. It is, therefore, essential to design hydrometric monitoring networks while considering the relationship between data collection and model application. A new model-based network design strategy is proposed that embeds hydrological models into a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, facilitating direct optimization according to the model-based design objectives. This method is compared to the traditional model-based approach used to design hydrometric monitoring networks. The traditional approach is to first conduct optimization using secondary design objectives, that are not model based, to identify a set of optimal networks. Hydrological models are then applied as a post-processing mechanism to identify which of the optimal networks best satisfy the model orientated design objectives or users' needs. In this investigation, the well-established dual-entropy multi-objective optimization (DEMO) approach was employed to conduct the initial network design based on the principles of information theory, followed by post-processing with rainfall-runoff models. Two case studies are evaluated, a monitoring network reduction in the Fraser River basin and a network augmentation in an upstream subsection of the Churchill River basin. Results show that embedding models in the optimization algorithm consistently yields better network configurations compared to those identified using the traditional method. It is shown that a smaller size optimal network that outperforms larger size networks can be identified directly by the proposed method. The models and model performance criteria used in the design process can be readily adapted, allowing for a user-directed design capable of addressing problem-specific objectives on a case by case basis.

AB Increasing groundwater salinity and depletion of the aquifers are major concerns in the UAE. Isotopes of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon concentrations in groundwater were used to estimate evaporation loss using the isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen, and using a carbon isotope to trace inorganic carbon cycling in two main aquifers in the eastern part of the United Arab Emirates. The delta D-delta O-18 of groundwater samples plotted on a line given by: delta D = 4 delta O-18 + 4.4 (r(2) = 0.4). In comparison, the local meteoric water line (LMWL) has been defined by the line: delta D = 8 delta O-18 + 15. In order to better understand the system investigated, samples were separated into two groups based on the delta D-delta O-18 relationship. These are (1) samples that plot above the LMWL (delta D = 6.1 delta O-18 + 12.4, r(2) = 0.8) and which are located predominantly in the north of the study area, and (2) samples that plot below the LMWL (delta D = 5.6 delta O-18 + 6.2, r(2) = 0.8) and which are mostly distributed in the south. Slopes for both the groups are similar and lower than that for LMWL indicating potential evaporation of recharging water. However, the y-intercept, which differs between the two groups, suggests evaporation of return flow and evapotranspiration in the unsaturated zone to be more significant in the south. This is attributed to intense agricultural activities in the region. Samples from the eastern Gravel Plain aquifer have 813 C and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) values in the range from -10 to 17 parts per thousand, and 12-100 mg C/l, respectively, while the range for those from the Ophiolite aquifer is from -11 to -16.4 parts per thousand, and 16-114 mg C/l respectively. This suggests the control of C-3 and C-4 plants on DIC formation, an observation supported by the range delta C-13 Of Soil organic matter (from -18.5 to -22-1 parts per thousand.)

AB Quality control is a major prerequisite for using meteorological information. High quality data sources are vital to scientists, engineers and decision makers alike. Validation of meteorological data ensures that the information needed has been properly generated and that it identifies incorrect values and detects problems that require immediate maintenance attention. In this work, several quality assurance procedures based on different criteria are proposed and applied to meteorological data from the Agroclimatic Information Network of Andalusia (Southern Spain) to assess their integrity and quality. The procedures include validations of record structure data, range/limits, time and internal consistency, persistence and spatial consistency tests. Quality assurance tests consist of procedures or rules against which data are tested, setting data flags to provide guidance to end users. The proposed system is capable of identifying several types of errors and is used as a tool that allows one to make decisions such as sensor replacement and to remove data prior to their application.

AB Shallow alluvial aquifers are important local and regional water resources but obtaining sufficient hydrogeologic data to properly characterize their spatial extent and hydraulic conditions can often be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. In this study, we used over 40,000 measurements of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data and hydraulic conductivity (K) data from 33 pump tests across eight shallow alluvial and glacial outwash aquifer field sites in Iowa to: (1) assess the relation between hydraulic K tests and electrical resistivity (ER) in alluvial and glacial outwash systems; and (2) evaluate the application of the ER-K relationship as input data for local-scale groundwater flow modeling. Average field-measured K across the eight sites was 95 m/day and ranged from 29 to 246 m/day, whereas aquifer resistivity ranged from 27 to 896 (ohm-m). Both K and ER were greater at the glacial outwash aquifer sites compared to the alluvial aquifer sites and a linear relationship (R-2 = 0.90) was observed between field-measured K and ER when incorporating all field sites. We evaluated how K derived from the ER-K relationship compared to K estimated from pump tests and calibrated K in a local-scale groundwater flow model. The K estimated by the ER-K relationship was comparable to the K estimated from the pump tests in terms of providing reasonable values for model development. Utilizing the ER-K relationship to estimate K would save significant time compared to conducting pump tests. Hence, estimating K from electrical resistivity can provide a non-intrusive, cost and time efficient way to evaluate and model alluvial aquifers.

DE specific sediment yield; geomorphic adjustment; scale effect; stream
   power; Yellow River
AB Based on data from 199 stations in the Yellow River drainage basin for which more than 5 years of data are available, the relationship between specific sediment yield (Y-s) and drainage area (A) has been studied. This relationship for the Yellow River basin is different from those for many other rivers of the world, both at the scale of whole basin and at local scales. With increasing basin area, the specific sediment yield increases, reaches a maximum, and then declines. The non-linear variation in the Y-s-A relationship can be explained by, first, surface material distribution; second, adjustment of the basin at macro time- and space-scales; and the third, the variation of energy expenditure with drainage-basin scale. As the loess deposits in the high-relief headwater areas is thin, it can be exhausted much more rapidly by flowing water erosion than in other areas, so the underlying erosion-resistant bedrock may be exposed much earlier. In many rivers in the study area, bedrock is exposed in the upper part of the drainage basin, and loess appears in the middle part, with a thickness that increases downstream to a peak, followed by a decline. Due to the influence of these spatial patterns of surface material distribution, a spatial pattern of specific sediment yield appears. The non-linear Y-s-A relationship may be interpreted as an indication that the fluvial system of the Yellow River is still at the stage of strong adjustment to the environmental change of Pleistocene-Holocene transition, especially to the change of dominant geomorphic agency from wind to flowing water. This non-linear relationship can also be explained by the variation of stream power with the drainage basin scale. The stream power increases with drainage area to a peak value, and subsequently decreases, a trend that is similar to the trend of the Y-s-A relationship. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spontaneous imbibition (SI) of wetting fluids is an important process for many hydrological and geological applications. In this study, we investigated experimentally and theoretically the SI process in a dual-porosity medium consisting of the matrix and the filled fracture. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF NMR) technology was used to dynamically monitor the distribution of the imbibed water in the dual-porosity media during the SI experiments. Based on the LF NMR theory, a cut-off method was proposed to quantitatively distinguish the imbibed water from the matrix and the filled fracture. The results showed that the rate of matrix imbibition was greater in the dual-porosity media than in single-porosity media. This inconsistent rate of matrix imbibition between the single-porosity media and the dual-porosity media was caused by the enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture. An analytical model was then proposed to characterize this enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture. It was found that the rate of matrix imbibition was not only affected by the presence of the filled fractures but also depended on the size of the particles filled in the fracture. A clear non-monotonic relationship was found between the rate of matrix imbibition and the size of the particles filled in the fracture. The rate of matrix imbibition initially increased and then decreased as the size of the particles filled in the fracture increased. The proposed analytical model not only highlighted the mechanism of enhanced mass transfer between the matrix and the filled fracture, but was also able to determine the optimum equivalent capillary diameter of the filled particles in the fracture for enhanced rate of matrix imbibition in dualporosity media.

The total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) contents and the nitrogen activation coefficient (NAC) were measured to investigate the soil nitrogen dynamics under three inundation treatments (-5, 0 and 5 cm). The results showed that TN was generally accumulated in all soil layers and exhibited a peak value in subsurface soils at the -5-cm inundation level at the end of the incubation period, whereas no obvious changes were observed in the TN contents in the bottom soils at the three inundation levels. Compared with the initial contents in the soils, the NO3--N and NH4+-N contents were significantly reduced in all soil layers at the 0-cm and the 5-cm inundation levels at the end of the incubation period. In general, the available nitrogen content was higher in the surface soils compared with the deeper soils at all inundation levels. The NAC values exhibited a pronounced change in the subsurface soils at all inundation levels, decreasing significantly from 0.17 to 0.04 at the 5-cm inundation level; however, a higher mean NAC value (0.126) was found over the incubation period at the 0-cm inundation level compared with the 5-cm and the -5-cm inundation levels. Nitrogen was released from plants into the soil under all inundation treatments over the incubation period. The soil organic matter exerted positive loadings on the TN and NO3--N contents and negative loadings on the NH4+-N content at all inundation levels, and the water content generally exhibited a negative relationship with all forms of nitrogen. Additionally, the total phosphorus content exhibited a positive correlation with the TN and NO3--N contents. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Most infiltration and water retention models for unsaturated porous media proposed in the literature often are based on simplified representations of the pore system and use the matric head as the main state variable.
   An integrated study on the hydraulic properties of homogeneous calcarenites with a complex pore network is presented, aimed at assessing water infiltration and retention mechanisms, starting from dry to wet conditions under high water inflow.
   Medium-grained grainstones and fine-grained packstones were used as material for laboratory testing and model set up. Petrophysical characterization and bimodal distribution of pore volume was obtained by standard and unconventional procedures. Permeability test under saturated conditions was performed with constant and falling head tests. Falling head infiltration tests at bench scale were carried out to estimate the hydraulic properties of the materials under unsaturated conditions.
   Unsaturated hydraulic relationships such as the soil water retention curve (SWRC) and hydraulic conductivity function were examined. The advection-diffusion form of Richard's equation, together with the pore bundle model and dual porosity concept under equilibrium conditions represent the theoretical framework used to investigate the unsaturated hydraulic behavior of the calcarenites in the falling head infiltration test. The SWRC, relative hydraulic conductivity and celerity were determined through the capillary theory and pore bundle concept considering the bi-modal nature of the pore-size distribution. Theoretical solutions and model predictions were compared with experimental data, which demonstrated the dominant control of macro-porosity on water flow and infiltration rate. In particular, our experimental results indicate that the wetting front propagates mainly through the macropores with a gravity driven flow velocity higher than the diffusive flow through the micropores. The effect of texture, degree of saturation and boundary conditions on infiltration dynamics is discussed.

AB While determining the water balance for large irrigation schemes, coping with complexities and uncertainties in estimation of groundwater (GW) abstraction is still a challenge. On other hand, estimating GW abstraction is of paramount importance to ensure the proper management of surface and GW resources. Although, there are number of well-known methods exist to map GW abstraction, utilization-factor (U-f) is considered as a reliable method. However, at large scales, tubewells utilization time required for U-f method is difficult to retrieve as large and small tubewells are governed under different rules. Geo-informatics is another emerging approach being used to estimate GW abstraction, however, there are several complexities and uncertainties involved in characterizing GW abstraction using satellite remote sensing imagery that leads to inaccurate end results. In current study, in-situ GW measurements were performed to calibrate and validate the GW abstraction estimated from geo-informatics approach at Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) command area of the Indus basin of Pakistan. For insitu measurements, an intensive tubewell survey was conducted at a grid size of 1 km at 30 locations situated at head, middle and tail end reaches of the LBDC. For the geo-informatics approach used in this study, GW abstraction is considered as a difference of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from net canal water use and effective rainfall after satisfying soil moisture storage changes. Results of calibration of geo-informatics approach compared with the in-situ measurements showed R-2 of 0.89, 0.81 and 0.79 at head, middle and tail end reaches, respectively. Intra-grid annual comparison of in-situ measurements showed that tubewells were being governed by different rules and thus yielded different abstraction within a grid ranging from 854 mm (+/- 105) at head, 742 mm (+/- 220) at middle and 649 mm (+/- 244) at tail grids. Statistical analysis showed that annual GW abstraction by in-situ measurements at head 814 mm (+/- 52), middle 769 mm (+/- 44) and tail 688 mm (+/- 56) end reaches varied significantly at a confidence interval of 95%. The spatial mapping by geo-informatics showed that farmers' fields situated at proximity of head end reaches utilize 4% and 9% extra water than from those placed at middle and tail end reaches, respectively. The inequity of GW abstraction in LBDC command area highlighted in this study requires immediate intervention of policy makers for sustainable GW management.

TI Effect of soil texture and excitation frequency on the propagation and
   attenuation of acoustic waves at saturated conditions
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE soil texture; acoustic waves; poroelasticity
ID POROUS-MEDIA; POROSITY; SPEED; SOUND
AB The study of the propagation and dissipation of acoustic waves through a fluid-containing porous medium is crucial for the successful application of seismic methods to characterize subsurface hydrological properties. To gain a better understanding of changes in two important acoustic wave characteristics (speed and attenuation) due to the effect of soil. texture and excitation frequency, a complex-valued dispersion relation obtained from the Biot theory of poroelasticity was solved numerically for eleven soil texture classes whose pore space is fully saturated by one of two very different fluids, air or water. Two modes of acoustic motion can be demonstrated to exist, known as the Biot fast and slow waves. Five tower excitation frequencies (100-500 Hz) were selected for numerical simulation, below which Darcy's law remains valid for describing porous media flow under wave perturbation.
   Numerical results show that in the frequency range we examined, the predicted phase speed of the Biot fast wave takes the same value as the Biot reference speed. The variation in speed is not obvious in a water-filled system, but becomes more significant in an air-filled system. When the pore fluid is water, an inverse linear relation exists between the phase speed of the Biot fast wave and porosity. An important physical parameter controlling its attenuation coefficient is intrinsic permeability, which renders a positive impact. A statistical analysis indicates that the attenuation coefficient of the Biot fast wave linearly increases with an increase in intrinsic permeability. In an air-saturated system, the phase speed of the Biot slow wave is found to be quadratically proportional to intrinsic permeability, whereas the attenuation coefficient of the Biot slow wave bears a quadratic relation with the inverse of intrinsic permeability. A study on the influence of pore fluid reveals that the Biot fast wave attenuates more in the water-saturated system than in the air-saturated system; an exception occurs in clay. A reverse trend is observed for the Biot stow wave.
   As far as the effect of excitation frequency is concerned, the attenuation coefficient of the Biot fast wave is essentially proportional to the square of excitation frequency, whereas the phase speed and attenuation coefficient of the Biot slow wave are both proportional to the square root of excitation frequency. The phase speed of the Biot fast wave is frequency independent. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The bedrock controls on catchment mixing, storage, and release have been actively studied in recent years. However, it has been difficult to find neighbouring catchments with sufficiently different and clean expressions of geology to do comparative analysis. Here, we present new data for 16 nested catchments (0.45 to 410km(2)) in the Alzette River basin (Luxembourg) that span a range of clean and mixed expressions of schists, phyllites, sandstones, and quartzites to quantify the relationships between bedrock permeability and metrics of water storage and release. We examined 9years' worth of precipitation and discharge data, and 6years of fortnightly stable isotope data in streamflow, to explore how bedrock permeability controls (a) streamflow regime metrics, (b) catchment storage, and (c) isotope response and catchment mean transit time (MTT). We used annual and winter precipitation-run-off ratios, as well as average summer and winter precipitation-run-off ratios to characterise the streamflow regime in our 16 study catchments. Catchment storage was then used as a metric for catchment comparison. Water mixing potential of 11 catchments was quantified via the standard deviation in streamflow D (sigma D) and the amplitude ratio (A(S)/A(P)) of annual cycles of O-18 in streamflow and precipitation. Catchment MTT values were estimated via both stable isotope signature damping and hydraulic turnover calculations. In our 16 nested catchments, the variance in ratios of summer versus winter average run-off was best explained by bedrock permeability. Whereas active storage (defined here as a measure of the observed maximum interannual variability in catchment storage) ranged from 107 to 373mm, total catchment storage (defined as the maximum catchment storage connected to the stream network) extended up to similar to 1700mm (+/- 200mm). Catchment bedrock permeability was strongly correlated with mixing proxies of sigma D in streamflow and O-18 A(S)/A(P) ratios. Catchment MTT values ranged from 0.5 to 2years, based on stable isotope signature damping, and from 0.5 to 10years, based on hydraulic turnover.

AB The extensive snow measurement network of the Sonnblick region (Hohe Tauern, Austrian Alps) is used to describe temporal trends of snow-depth as well as its relation to climate change for a high-elevated site of the European Alps (2400-3100 m.a.s.l.). Spatial representativeness of single snow stakes, with readings back to 1928, is derived for maximum snow-depth in May using a spatially dense snow depth probing from glacier mass balance measurements. Long-term trends of snow depth show a significant reduction in the contribution of snow accumulation from core-winter (I December to I March) compared to early and late-winter periods. Largest values of snow-depth since 1928 were measured in the 1940s and 1950s. Comparison of monthly changes in snow-depth with precipitation measurements underlines the high influence of wind drift on snow-depth during winter season froth 1 October to 30 April. Whereas inter-annual variability of maximum snow-depth is better explained by low elevation precipitation measurements than by local (high elevation) precipitation measurements, the longer-term mean of local precipitation measurements, however, fits well to the snow-depth measurements, if a mean snow-density of about 400 kg m(-3) is assumed (which matches field observations). Both maximum snow-depth and winter season precipitation show a clear decreasing trend for inter-annual variability. A statistical relationship between air temperature and fraction of solid precipitation is used for estimation of temporal trends in the fraction of solid precipitation at measurement sites. For summer a decrease of about 1% of solid precipitation per decade was found for the lowest elevated sites whereas fraction of solid precipitation in winter remains stable. Relation between snow-depth and climate is investigated by means of local climate data of Sonnblick-Observatory (SBO) and by means of the North-Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI). Whereas winter air-temperature is significantly correlated with the NAOI, for winter precipitation and snow depth on 1 May no correlation was found with NAOI.

AB Spatial and temporal patterns of spring break-up flooding in the slave River Delta (SRD). Northwest Territories are characterized during three years (2003-2005) usign water isotope tracers and total inorganic suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations measured form lakewater samples collected shortly after the spring melt. Strongly contrasting spring melt periods led to a moderate flood in 2003, no flooding in 2004 and widespread flooding in 2005. Flooded lakes have isotopcally-depleted delta O-18(delta H-2) signatures, ranging between -19.2 parts per thousand (-145 parts per thousand) and -17.1 parts per thousand (-146 parts per thousand) and most have high TSS concentrations (>10 mg L-1) while non-flooded lakes have more isotopically-enriched delta 18O (delta 2H) signatures rnaging between -18.2 parts per thousand (-149 parts per thousand) and -10.6 parts per thousand (-118 parts per thousand) and low TSS concentrations (<10 mg L-1). These results in conjunction with the isotopic signatures of Slave River water and snowmelt are used to estimate the proportion of river- or snowmelt-induced dilution in delta lakes during the spring of each study year. Calculatins idicate river flooding caused dilution of similar to 70-100% in delta lakes, while snowmelt dilution in the absence of river flooding ranged form similar to 0-56%. A positive relationship exists between the spatial extent of spring flooding in the SRD and level and discharge on the slave river and upstream tributaries suggesting that upstream flow generation plays a key role in deltermining the magnitude of spring flooding in the SRD. parallel variations in the 46-year instrumental Slave River discharge record and flood stratigraphy in the active delta indicate that there is potential for extending the flood history of the SRD a development that will contribute to a more robust understanding of the drivers of histroic, contemporary and futrure flood frequency in the delta.

AB High-frequency temperature data were recorded at one height and they were used in Surface Renewal (SR) analysis to estimate sensible heat flux during the full growing season of two rice fields located north-northeast of Colusa, CA (in the Sacramento Valley). One of the fields was seeded into a flooded paddy and the other was drill seeded before flooding. To minimize fetch requirements, the measurement height was selected to be close to the maximum expected canopy height. The roughness sub-layer depth was estimated to discriminate if the temperature data came from the inertial or roughness sub-layer. The equation to estimate the roughness sub-layer depth was derived by combining simple mixing-length theory, mixing-layer analogy, equations to account for stable atmospheric surface layer conditions, and semi-empirical canopy-architecture relationships. The potential for SR analysis as a method that operates in the full surface boundary layer was tested using data collected over growing vegetation at a site influenced by regional advection of sensible heat flux. The inputs used to estimate the sensible heat fluxes included air temperature sampled at 10 Hz, the mean and variance of the horizontal wind speed, the canopy height, and the plant area index for a given intermediate height of the canopy. Regardless of the stability conditions and measurement height above the canopy, sensible heat flux estimates using SR analysis gave results that were similar to those measured with the eddy covariance method. Under unstable cases, it was shown that the performance was sensitive to estimation of the roughness sub-layer depth. However, an expression was provided to select the crucial scale required for its estimation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Finding a relationship between soil moisture and soil water flux at a single soil depth has been of particular interest in recent years. Such a relationship, however, is challenging to derive due to a high degree of nonlinearity of the soil water flow governing equation, known as Richards equation. This paper presents a new algebraic soil moisture-flux relationship based on an approximate analytical solution of Richards equation with arbitrary soil hydraulic functions. This solution accounts for the groundwater contributions to soil moisture variations along the unsaturated zone. The new solution was evaluated using numerical solutions of Richards equation via the HYDRUS-1D model. Despite its simplicity, the new solution could reproduce HYDRUS-1D simulations for a homogeneous soil profile with coefficient of determination (R2) higher than 0.9 in most cases. The new solution offers a potential approach to modeling groundwater recharge in existing groundwater models. In particular, this model can potentially provide a more realistic recharge estimate compared to the kinematic-wave approximation of Richards equation, that neglects upward flows through the vadose zone. Future research is needed to account for soil layering and root water uptake in the soil moisture-flux relationship.

AB Time series of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in rivers can be used to quantify groundwater contributions to streamflow, and timescales of catchment storage. However, these isotope hydrology techniques rely on distinct spatial or temporal patterns of delta H-2 and delta O-18 within the hydrologic cycle. In New Zealand, lack of understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of delta H-2 and delta O-18 of river water hinders development of regional and national-scale hydrological models. We measured delta H-2 and delta O-18 monthly, together with river flow rates at 58 locations across New Zealand over a two-year period. Results show: (a) general patterns of decreasing delta H-2 and delta O-18 with increasing latitude were altered by New Zealand's major mountain ranges; delta H-2 and delta O-18 were distinctly lower in rivers fed from higher elevation catchments, and in eastern rain-shadow areas of both islands; (b) river water delta H-2 and delta O-18 values were partly controlled by local catchment characteristics (catchment slope, PET, catchment elevation, and upstream lake area) that influence evaporation processes; (c) regional differences in evaporation caused the slope of the river water line (i.e., the relationship between delta H-2 and delta O-18 in river water) for the (warmer) North Island to be lower than that of the (cooler, mountain-dominated) South Island; (d) delta H-2 seasonal offsets (i.e., the difference between seasonal peak and mean values) for individual sites ranged from 0.50 parts per thousand to 5.07 parts per thousand. Peak values of delta O-18 and delta H-2 were in late summer, but values peaked 1 month later at the South Island sites, likely due to greater snow-melt contributions to streamflow. Strong spatial differences in river water delta H-2 and delta O-18 caused by orographic rainfall effects and evaporation may inform studies of water mixing across landscapes. Generally distinct seasonal isotope cycles, despite the large catchment sizes of rivers studied, are encouraging for transit time analysis applications.

AB The effects of land-use changes on the runoff process in the midstream plain of this arid inland river basin are a key factor in the rational allocation of water resources to the middle and lower reaches. The question is whether and by how much increasingly heavy land use impacts the hydrological processes in such an arid inland river basin. The catchment of the Heihe River, one of the largest inland rivers in the arid region of northwest China, was chosen to investigate the hydrological responses to land-use change. Flow duration curves were used to detect trends and variations in runoff between the upper and lower reaches. Relationships among precipitation, upstream runoff, and hydrological variables were identified to distinguish the effects of climatic changes and upstream runoff changes on middle and downstream runoff processes. The quantitative relation between midstream cultivated land use and various parameters of downstream runoff processes were analysed using the four periods of land-use data since 1956. The Volterra numerical function relation of the hydrological non-linear system response was utilized to develop a multifactor hydrological response simulation model based on the three factors of precipitation, upstream runoff, and cultivated land area. The results showed that, since 1967, the medium- and high-coverage natural grassland area in the midstream region has decreased by 80.1%, and the downstream runoff has declined by 27.32% due to the continuous expansion of the cultivated land area. The contribution of cultivated land expansion to the impact on the annual total runoff is 14-31%. on the annual, spring and winter base flow it is 44-75%, and on spring and winter discharge it is 23-64%. Once the water conservation plan dominated by land-use structural adjustments is implemented over the next 5 years, the mean annual discharge in the lower reach could increase by 8.98% and the spring discharge by 26.28%. This will significantly alleviate the imbalance between water supply and demand in both its quantity and temporal distribution in the middle and lower reaches.

AB This study was conducted to estimate the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity through the van Genuchten model using easy to measure soil properties by regression and artificial neural networks methods. In this study, 148 soil samples were taken from five provinces of Iran. Basic soil properties (clay, silt/sand and bulk density) and other soil properties were measured. Soil water retention curve was measured to obtain the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve using the van Genuchten-Mualem model. Confined compression curve was measured and the modified model of van Genuchten was fitted on its data. Two-thirds and one-third of the data were used for the training and testing steps, respectively. Confined compression curve parameters and other soil properties were used as predictors to estimate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) were developed in two separate parts: in 5 and 6 PTFs basic soil properties were or were not used as predictors, respectively. The artificial neural networks (ANNs) performed better than the regression methods. Among the ANN-developed PTFs which have not used basic soil properties as predictors, PTFa3, with the inputs of the parameters of confined compression curve (n*, a* and e(o)), performed better than the others. Also, among the ANN-developed PTFs that used basic soil properties as predictors along with the other input variables, PTFb5 that used the sigma(mc) (stress at the maximum curvature) and sigma(i) (stress at the inflection point) as inputs along with basic soil properties, performed better than the other PTFs. The results showed a successful prediction of the hydraulic conductivity curve using confined compression curve. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation notably influences transport and mixing processes and can thus be used for controlling the fate of substances in the hydro-environment. Whilst most work covers fully vegetated conditions, the novelty of this paper is to focus on flows with real-scale flexible willow patches. We aimed to investigate how longitudinal dispersion varies according to the spatial distribution, density and coverage of the patches and to evaluate the explanatory power of predictors that consider the hydraulics, vegetation and channel geometry. Salt tracer experiments were performed in a trapezoidal channel where we established 3-4 m long and 1-1.6 m wide patches of artificial foliated willows that reproduced the shapes and plant densities observed on woody-vegetated floodplains. We examined sparsely distributed patches with low areal/volumetric coverage of 6-11%, and non-vegetated conditions for reference. Flow depths and surface widths were 0.7-0.9 and 6-7 m, respectively, and the mean flow velocities ranged at 0.3-0.6 m/s. The emergent patches generated from a negligible to over a four-fold increase in the longitudinal dispersion when compared with non-vegetated conditions. The patches with a preferential location in low-velocity areas, such as near banks, or with a high plant density and a blockage of the cross-sectional flow area.0.4, led to the largest dispersion and residence times. Patches under such configurations enhanced the normalized differential velocity defined as the difference between the highest (90th percentile) and lowest (10th percentile) cross-sectional flow velocities divided by the mean velocity, thus increasing shear dispersion. As existing analytical predictors failed to estimate the effect of different patch configurations, we proposed the change in the normalized differential velocity between vegetated and corresponding non-vegetated conditions as a basic predictor of the reach-scale longitudinal dispersion coefficient under patchy vegetation. In contrast, we observed no clear relationship between flow resistance and dispersion. Thus, our findings indicated that bankside vegetation may allow for reduced peak concentrations and lengthened residence times, supporting pollutant management, while ensuring good flow conveyance. Such rare field-scale analyses improve the estimation of solute transport in real vegetated flows.

AB In the small Ringelbach research catchment, where studies on the water cycle components in a granitic mountainous environment have been conducted since 1976, the water-saturated areas that are hydraulically connected to the outlet play a major role in the streamflow generation, as it is here that complex interactions between atmosphere, surface and ground waters take place. During baseflow recession periods, which may last several months between two groundwater recharge events, the atmospheric inputs of water and energy on these contributing areas only explain the streamflow fluctuations observed around the master recession curve, which defines the groundwater contribution: fluctuating above it in the case of precipitation input on these areas, below it in the case of evaporation output from these areas. Streamflow may therefore largely deviate from the master recession curve in the case of long, hot, dry spells. Detailed mapping has shown that their variable extent is well related to baseflow by a loglinear curve. On the other hand, a synthetic master recession curve, well fitted by a second-order hyperbolic function, has been obtained from numerous pure recession periods. Both based on these two curves, a simple procedure and a simple model have been used to (i) validate the hypothesis that the connected saturated areas are the only permanent variable contributing areas and (ii) simulate the daily streamflow volumes over long baseflow recession periods by a water balance of the aquifer below these areas only. The storm runoff ratio for small to moderate rainfall events is indeed corresponding to the catchment saturated fraction at that time. The volume of daily streamflow oscillations is indeed corresponding to the evaporation at the potential rate from the saturated areas only. In both cases, streamflow naturally tends towards the master recession curve after the end of any atmospheric perturbation. Introducing these findings into TOPMODEL led to significantly improved simulation results during baseflow recession periods. The master recession curve may therefore be considered as a dynamic equilibrium curve. Together with the relationship between saturated extent and baseflow, it provides the main characteristics necessary to understand and model the interactions at this complex interface and the resulting daily streamflow variations during baseflow recession periods in this type of catchment.

AB We employ elements of information theory to quantify (i) the information content related to data collected at given measurement scales within the same porous medium domain and (ii) the relationships among information contents of datasets associated with differing scales. We focus on gas permeability data collected over Berea Sandstone and Topopah Spring Tuff blocks, considering four measurement scales. We quantify the way information is shared across these scales through (i) the Shannon entropy of the data associated with each support scale, (ii) mutual information shared between data taken at increasing support scales, and (iii) multivariate mutual information shared within triplets of datasets, each associated with a given scale. We also assess the level of uniqueness, redundancy and synergy (rendering, i.e., information partitioning) of information content that the data associated with the intermediate and largest scales provide with respect to the information embedded in the data collected at the smallest support scale in a triplet.

AB The annual maximum amount of rainfall over a fixed duration, area, and level of occurrence is generally described by intensity-duration-area-frequency (IDAF) curves. The annual maxima analysis can provide poor estimates of quantiles associated to high return periods when the sample size is short. Here, IDAF curves are derived analytically from the statistical properties of event maxima of rainfall intensity in area and duration, which are assumed scale invariant in time and space and Lognormal distributed, with a Poissonian chronology of rain events. The event maxima methodology is applied to the Reno basin, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, and its IDAF curves are compared in terms of goodness-of-fit to those obtained through the annual maxima analysis, showing better performances. In particular, we found that the absolute difference, in %, between model and data, is 20% in average, and 7% in standard deviation, using the method based on the event maxima analysis, while it is 27% in average, and 12% in standard deviation, using the method based on the annual maxima analysis.

AB This paper proposes new conceptual sediment graph models based on coupling of popular and extensively used methods, viz., Nash model based instantaneous unit sediment graph (IUSG), soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method, and Power taw. These models vary in their complexity and this paper tests their performance using data of the Nagwan watershed (area = 92.46 km(2)) (India). The sensitivity of total sediment yield and peak sediment flow rate computations to model parameterisation is analysed. The exponent of the Power law, beta, is more sensitive than other model parameters. The models are found to have substantial potential for computing sediment graphs (temporal sediment flow rate distribution) as well as total sediment yield. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB A realistic model of surface-atmosphere exchanges was created by coupling the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) with an advanced, two-dimensional model of the atmospheric boundary layer. This was initiated and tested using data obtained from the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment (FIFE). This model was used to investigate the acceptability of simple rules for defining the aggregate value of the parameters required to specify surface interactions, as applied to heterogeneous mixes of vegetation types allowed in BATS but appropriate to the FIFE site, namely short and long grass, mixed crops, and irrigated crops. Under the range of meteorological and surface conditions relevant to FIFE and as used in this study, these rules are shown to estimate aggregate parameters which give surface fluxes similar to those calculated with an explicit representation of separate vegetation patches, except in the particular case of artificially wetted (irrigated) patches set in an otherwise dry landscape.

AB The objective of the study was to assess the performance of a new parameterisation scheme of ground heat flux (G) for retrieving surface fluxes from remote sensing data (MODIS-Terra). Formulae that are based on empirical relationships relating G to net radiation, R-n (G = alpha R-n, alpha being a function of a vegetation index, VI) are currently used, but presented drawbacks, especially in bare or sparse vegetation areas because of the poor adequacy of VI-based relationships to account for changes in soil moisture. In this study, we proposed to link a to the evaporative fraction, EF. In a first step, using a non-dimensional form of the surface energy balance, we demonstrated that a is functionally related to EF and to the ratio gamma = G/H (H = sensible heat flux). In a second step, we proposed an EF-based parameterisation of alpha, using ground fluxes data sets collected throughout the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 at four flux-tower sites in West African countries (Mali, Benin, Niger) that differ in surface conditions and Monsoon influence. The analysis indicated that the average site-specific values of alpha and EF were well described by a linear relationship of the type alpha = a EF + b, with a = -0.22 and b = 0.23. In a third stage, we investigated whether ET-retrieval from remote sensing information (MODIS-Terra) using the new parameterisation of alpha perform better than the classical formulation through VI-based relationships. We found that the retrieved values of H using the new parameterisation supplied the best agreement with the observed ground data and significant improvement with respect to estimates from alpha-VI relationships. Advantages and limitations of the proposed parameterisation scheme were discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stream water phosphorus (P) concentrations for three nested pastureland catchments located in southern Ireland, having areas of 0.14, 2.11, and 15.24 km(2), were monitored for the purpose of defining the hydrological controls on the P transport. Concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships were developed for total phosphorus (TP) and its two components, dissolved phosphorus (DP) and particulate phosphorus (PP), where Q is the area-normalized discharge. An analysis of covariance statistical test was applied to determine if any differences in C-Q relationships existed between sub-catchments. Significant differences (p < 0.01) between sites were found for the TP and PP C-Q relationships, but not for the DP C-Q relationships, indicating that phosphorus transport in its sediment-bound particulate form was alone responsible for the differences in overall P fluxes between sites. The intermediate-scale catchment possessed the highest discharge-specific PP and suspended solid concentrations. An analysis of catchment topography was undertaken in an attempt to explain the observed differences in the C-Q relationships for the individual sub-catchments. The distributions of the ln(A(s)/tan beta) topographic index, where A(s) is the upslope contributing area per unit contour width and beta is the local slope, were first considered in order to test the conceptual model of variable saturated area control on the overland PP transport. Next, the distributions of the length-slope (LS) factor from the universal soil loss equation were evaluated as an index of erosion to describe PP transport. Neither topographic descriptor was found to satisfactorily conform to the C-Q observations, indicating that local catchment sediment delivery factors or in-stream channel processes are likely to be responsible for the observed differences.

AB The release of radioactive iodine into geological media from nuclear waste disposal is an issue that has to be considered since iodine is a biophilic element. I-129 is, with Tc-99, one of the two long-lived radionuclides that have the highest mobility in radioactive waste disposal. Within this context, iodide retardation is still a matter of debate. A low value of the retardation factor is generally accepted in soils without organic matter, but the possibility for sorption cannot be completely ruled out. Since isotopic exchange with naturally occurring iodine is one of the main potential sorption mechanisms, site-specific retention parameters are needed. In the present paper, we study iodide transport in a sandy aquifer. A hydrogeological model was built to fit deuterium, bromide and iodide breakthrough data from in situ tracer test experiments. Within the precision range of the fitting, iodide is excluded from 2.5% of the effective porosity by anionic exclusion and presents a field retention factor (Kd) lower than 0.025 L/kg.

AB Fluid flow tests were conducted on two crossed fracture models for which the geometries of fracture segments and intersections were measured by utilizing a visualization technique using a CCD (charged coupled device) camera. Numerical simulations by solving the Navier-Stokes equations were performed to characterize the fluid flow at fracture intersections. The roles of hydraulic gradient, surface roughness, intersecting angle, and scale effect in the nonlinear fluid flow behavior through single fracture intersections were investigated. The simulation results of flow rate agreed well with the experimental results for both models. The experimental and simulation results showed that with the increment of the hydraulic gradient, the ratio of the flow rate to the hydraulic gradient, Q/J, decreases and the relative difference of QJJ between the calculation results employing the Navier-Stokes equations and the cubic law, 6, increases. When taking into account the fracture surface roughness quantified by Z(2) ranging 0-0.42 for J = 1, the value of delta would increase by 0-10.3%. The influences of the intersecting angle on the normalized flow rate that represents the ratio of the flow rate in a segment to the total flow rate, R-a, and the ratio of the hydraulic aperture to the mechanical aperture, e/E, are negligible when J < 10(-3), whereas their values change significantly when J > 10(-2). Based on the regression analysis on simulation results, a mathematical expression was proposed to quantify elE, involving variables off and R-r, where R-r is the radius of truncating circles centered at an intersection. For E/R-r > 10(-2), e/E varies significantly and the scale of model has large impacts on the nonlinear flow behavior through intersections, while for E/R-r < 10(-3), the scale effect is negligibly small. Finally, a necessary condition to apply the cubic law to fluid flow through fracture intersections is suggested as J < 10(-3), E/R-r<10(-3), and Z(2) = 0. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There are multiple relationship curves between watershed socioeconomic development and water environmental conservation. The goal of this paper is to present a theoretical pattern of economic activities and water environmental improvement by incorporating their bidirectional causality relationship. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) has been useful in connecting economic and environmental concepts, thus becoming an important tool for evaluating watershed sustainability. The high governance cost makes water pollution-intensive goods relatively expensive to produce. According to the EKC, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between water environment deterioration and the level of social and economic improvement. Based on EKC hypothesis, we studied the coordinated relationship between environmental protection of water and economic and social sustainable development in the Huntai River Watershed from 2003 to 2012 by means of a panel threshold data. The EKC is an empirical curve that describes the relationship between economic restructuring and water environmental conditions improvement. The Green Environmental Kuznets Curve (GEKC) is used to describe the relationship among watershed pollution emissions, the environmental quality and income per capita. However, according to the GEKC, U-shaped relationship exists between the coordination of water environmental protection and the level of social economic development (SED). The GEKC is affected by water resource consumption, the regional trade situation (T), the per capita gross domestic product level (Y), and controls on the total amount of water pollution discharge. We try to adjust to the type of GEKC curve and apply dataset of water pollutant emission reduction cost control to fit main characteristic of equilibrium cost. In accordance with Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary IPast Squares (DOLS) data statistical analysis, the value of the GEKC regression equation independent variables Y, Y-2, per capita water resources consumption (E), T, adding value of production (AVP) and modified socioeconomic development index (MSDI) were 1.988, -0.150, 0.720, 0.216, 0.070, and 1.890, respectively. In the long-term, the correlation formula of watershed per capita sewage discharge (C) to Y was 2.090-0.300Y. For every 1% increase in E, T, AVP, and MSDI, C increased by approximately 0.720%, 0.216%, 0.072%, and L890%, respectively. The E, T and MSDI are key factors in developing an effective way to control the levels of water pollution discharge. Pollution is endogenous, so water environment pollution is not necessarily caused by economic growth. According to the total amount control of water pollution discharge, the GEKC equilibrium optimization calculation results can be used to effectively control watershed pollutant emissions and improve water environmental quality. Through the adjustment of industrial structure or industrial transformation and technological progress, it is possible to change the relationship between current economic growth and water environment. With GEKC related Curve characteristic and indicator classes, it is possible to realize harmonious and sustainable development of regional economy and society in the Huntai River Watershed.

AB Modeling groundwater vulnerability reliably and cost effectively for non-point source (NPS) pollution at a regional scale remains a major challenge. In recent years, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), neural networks and fuzzy logic techniques have been used in several hydrological studies. However, few of these research studies have undertaken an extensive sensitivity analysis. The overall objective of this research is to examine the sensitivity of neuro-fuzzy models used to predict groundwater vulnerability in a spatial context by integrating GIS and neuro-fuzzy techniques. The specific objectives are to assess the sensitivity of neuro-fuzzy models in a spatial domain using GIS by varying (i) shape of the fuzzy sets, (ii) number of fuzzy sets, and (iii) learning and validation parameters (including rule weights). The neuro-fuzzy models were developed using NEFCLASS-J software on a JAVA platform and were loosely integrated with a GIS. Four plausible parameters which are critical in transporting contaminants through the soil profile to the groundwater, included soil hydrologic group, depth of the soil profile, soil structure (pedality points) of the A horizon, and landuse. In order to validate the model predictions, coincidence reports were generated among model inputs, model predictions, and well/spring contamination data for NO3-N. A total of 16 neuro-fuzzy models were developed for selected sub-basins of Illinois River Watershed, AR. The sensitivity analysis showed that neuro-fuzzy models were sensitive to the shape of the fuzzy sets, number of fuzzy sets, nature of the rule weights, and validation techniques used during the learning processes. Compared to bell-shaped and triangular-shaped membership functions, the neuro-fuzzy models with a trapezoidal membership function were the least sensitive to the various permutations and combinations of the learning and validation parameters. Over all, Models 11 and 8 showed relatively higher coincidence with well contamination data than other models. The strength of this method is that it offers a means of dealing with imprecise data, therefore, is a viable option for regional and continental scale environmental modeling where imprecise data prevail. The neuro-fuzzy models, however, should only be used as a tool within a broader framework of GIS, remote sensing and solute transport modeling to assess groundwater vulnerability along with functional, mechanistic and stochastic models.

AB Soil structure is an indicator of soil quality and its alterations following cropping system conversion or fertilization change evolve slowly. How such alterations vary with scale remains elusive. We investigated this based on the Rothamsted long-term wheat experiment (since 1843) in the UK. Triplicate cores 7 cm high and 10 cm in diameter were taken from plots that have been under different fertilizations or returned to natural woodland for more than one century for imaging using X-ray computed tomography with the voxel size being 40 mu m. We then broke each core and sampled three aggregates from it to scan with the voxel size being 1.5 mu m. For each core and aggregate sample, we calculated its pore size distribution, permeability and tortuosity. The results showed that the fertilization change >170 years ago reshaped the soil structure differently between the core scale and the aggregate scale. Macro-porosity of the pores (>40 mu m) in the cores unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilizers was low and the pores were poorly connected in the top 10 cm of soil, compared to those given farmyard manure or in the woodland. In all treatments, the pores in the core images were hydraulically anisotropic with their permeability in the horizontal direction being higher than that in the vertical direction, whereas the aggregates were comparatively isotropic. The fertilization affected image porosity and permeability at core scale more significantly than at aggregate scale, and the aggregates fertilized with farmyard manure and in the woodland were more permeable than the aggregates in other treatments. It was also found that compared to no-fertilization or fertilization with complete fertilizers, fertilizing without phosphorus over the past 20 years increased the porosity and permeability of the aggregates but not of the cores. Fertilization with inorganic fertilizers increased the tortuosity of the macropores in the cores but not of the intra-aggregate pores, compared to no-fertilization. Porosity-permeability relationship for aggregates unfertilized or fertilized with inorganic fertilisers followed a power law with R-2 > 0.8. In contrast, the permeability of the aggregates in farmyard manure and in the woodland trended differently as their porosity increased. The results also revealed that the transport ability of the aggregates and cores responded differently to carbon in that with soil carbon increasing, the permeability of the aggregates increased asymptotically while the permeability of the cores, especially its horizontal component, increased exponentially.

AB Urban areas are often covered by materials with smooth ground surface and poor water permeability, which may cause problems such as increasing flow velocity and discharge.
   This study employed the diffusion wave equation to investigate the variation of overland flow, and analytical solutions were obtained by the generalized integral transformation technique. Examining previous research, we found when the coefficients in the diffusion wave equation were treated as constants, the simulated results would be mass non-conservative. This study corrected the coefficients which makes the flow meet the mass conservation law to improve the simulation results. An alternative solution to the overland flow considering time-varying rainfall and infiltration were proposed and the results were well compared with previous numerical solutions and experimental data.

AB Randomness is an essential feature for groundwater ecology and fluid turbulence. The scale-up problem refers to the situation in which the randomness occurs on all scales. Classical dispersion theories are not applicable in this situation due to the coupling between adjacent length scales. The difficulty in theoretical formulations lies in the closure problem - namely, the higher order random quantities emerge in the derivations for the dynamical equations of the lower order random quantities. In this paper, we consider tracer particles driven by a Gaussian random velocity field. We develop a renormalized perturbation expansion method for this problem. Our theory shows that the effective dispersivity has very complicated structures. We introduce a pairwise time ordering approximation to derive an approximate expression for a local diffusion operator. Under this approximation, we develop a multi-length-scale theory which gives analytical predictions for the effective diffusion coefficient and for the size of the mixing region along with its scaling exponent. Our theory has no adjustable parameter. The quantitative theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with the results from full numerical simulations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Estimating the own-price elasticity of demand for irrigation water in
   the Musi catchment of India
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Derived demand for irrigation; Own-price elasticity of demand for water;
   Residual Method; Marginal value product of water; Krishna Basin; India
AB As irrigation water is an input into a production process, its demand must be 'derived'. According to theory, a derived demand schedule should be downward sloping and dependent on the outputs produced from it, the prices of other inputs and the price of the water itself. Problems arise when an attempt is made to estimate the demand for irrigation water and the resulting own-price elasticity of demand, as the uses to which water is put are spatially, temporarily and geographically diverse. Because water is not generally freely traded, what normally passes for an estimate of the own-price elasticity of demand for irrigation water is usually a well argued assumption or an estimate that is derived from a simulation model of a hypothesized producer. Such approaches tend to provide an inadequate explanation of what is an extremely complex and important relationship. An adequate explanation of the relationship between the price and the quantity demanded of water should be one that not only accords with the theoretical expectations, but also accounts for the diversity of products produced from water (which includes the management practices of farmers), the seasons in which it is used and over the region within which it is used. The objective in this article is to present a method of estimating the demand curve for irrigation water. The method uses actual field data which is collated using the Residual Method to determine the value of the marginal product of water deployed over a wide range of crops, seasons and regions. These values of the marginal products, all which must lie of the input demand schedule for water, are then ordered from the highest value to the lowest. Then, the amount of irrigation water used for each product, in each season and in each region is cumulatively summed over the range of uses according to the order of the values of the marginal products. This data, once ordered, is then used to econometrically estimate the demand schedule from which the own-price elasticity of demand for irrigation water can be derived. To illustrate the method, the values of the marginal product of water deployed in the Musi catchment in India are used to determine an own-price elasticity of demand for irrigation water which has some positive value to producers of approximately -0.64. For water that is most highly valued, the elasticity was found to be highly elastic at -2.12, while less valued water used in agriculture was far more inelastic at -0.44. Finally, for almost 36% of water deployed in the catchment the elasticity was logically determined to be perfectly elastic. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Monitoring runoff generation processes in the field is a prerequisite for developing conceptual hydrological models and theories. At the same time, our perception of hydrological processes strongly depends on the spatial and temporal scale of observation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate interactions between runoff generation processes of different spatial scales (plot scale, hillslope scale, and headwater scale). Different runoff generation processes of three hillslopes with similar topography, geology and soil properties, but differences in vegetation cover (grassland, coniferous forest, and mixed forest) within a small v-shaped headwater were measured: water table dynamics in wells with high spatial and temporal resolution, subsurface flow (SSF) of three 10m wide trenches at the bottom of the hillslopes subdivided into two trench sections each, overland flow at the plot scale, and catchment runoff. Bachmair et al. () found a high spatial variability of water table dynamics at the plot scale. In this study, we investigate the representativity of SSF observations at the plot scale versus the hillslope scale and vice versa, and the linkage between hillslope dynamics (SSF and overland flow) and streamflow. Distinct differences in total SSF within each 10m wide trench confirm the high spatial variability of the water table dynamics. The representativity of plot scale observations for hillslope scale SSF strongly depends on whether or not wells capture spatially variable flowpaths. At the grassland hillslope, subsurface flowpaths are not captured by our relatively densely spaced wells (3m), despite a similar trench flow response to the coniferous forest hillslope. Regarding the linkage between hillslope dynamics and catchment runoff, we found an intermediate to high correlation between streamflow and hillslope hydrological dynamics (trench flow and overland flow), which highlights the importance of hillslope processes in this small watershed. Although the total contribution of SSF to total event catchment runoff is rather small, the contribution during peak flow is moderate to substantial. Additionally, there is process synchronicity between spatially discontiguous measurement points across scales, potentially indicating subsurface flowpath connectivity. Our findings stress the need for (i) a combination of observations at different spatial scales, and (ii) a consideration of the high spatial variability of SSF at the plot and hillslope scale when designing monitoring networks and assessing hydrological connectivity.

AB Extreme floods are commonly estimated with the help of design storms and hydrological models. In this paper, we propose a new method to take into account the relationship between precipitation intensity (P) and air temperature (T) to account for potential snow accumulation and melt processes during the elaboration of design storms. The proposed method is based on a detailed analysis of this P-T relationship in the Swiss Alps. The region, no upper precipitation intensity limit is detectable for increasing temperature. However, a relationship between the highest measured temperature before a precipitation event and the duration of the subsequent event could be identified. An explanation for this relationship is proposed here based on the temperature gradient measured before the precipitation events. The relevance of these results is discussed for an example of Probable Maximum Precipitation-Probable Maximum Flood (PMP-PMF) estimation for the high mountainous Mattmark dam catchment in the Swiss Alps.
   The proposed method to associate a critical air temperature to a PMP is easily transposable to similar alpine settings where meteorological soundings as well as ground temperature and precipitation measurements are available. In the future, the analyses presented here might be further refined by distinguishing between precipitation event types (frontal versus orographic). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LAND-USE; STREAMFLOW; URBANIZATION; CLIMATE; SCALE
AB Hydrograph flashiness is a commonly used and valuable measure of hydrologic behavior, calculated directly from streamflow measurements. There is limited understanding of how and why flashiness varies at continental scales and within different hydroclimatic regions, which can aid in predicting regional responses to an accelerating water cycle. We addressed this knowledge gap by calculating a widely used metric of flashiness, the Richards-Baker Flashiness index (RBI), for 1144 watersheds across the continental US for a ten year period, using daily streamflow from USGS gages. While regional studies have suggested that flashiness is organized by watershed size, we show that flashiness is poorly organized by drainage area at continental scales. Moreover, relationship strengths and directions with drainage area varied by hydroclimatic regions. Using a regionally based random forest analysis, we show that empirical relationships between watershed characteristics and flashiness are diverse, emphasizing that drivers of flashiness are likely related to regional or smaller scale features that encapsulate relationships between climate, human impacts, and the subsurface.

TI MECHANICS AND THERMODYNAMICS OF MULTIPHASE FLOW IN POROUS-MEDIA
   INCLUDING INTERPHASE BOUNDARIES
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The main purpose of this work is to develop a macroscale thermodynamic theory to describe two-phase flow in porous media.  Full thermodynamic properties are assigned to the boundary surfaces separating the phases at the microscale.  Macroscopic equations of balance for mass, momentum, and energy for each phase and interface along with the averaged entropy inequality are employed as the starting point.  A constitutive theory is developed resulting in balance equations and thermodynamics appropriate for modelling multiphase flow in porous media.  Volume fractions of phases and areal fractions of interfaces are explicity included in the theory.  Incorporation of the interface equations into the theory allows for a complete description of the problem.  The manipulations provide explicit functional dependence of the capillary pressure.  An extended form of Darcy's law for multiphase flow is obtained from the macroscopic equations of momentum balance.  An additional term which accounts for non-uniform fluid saturation at equilibrium appears in the result.

AB In an earlier study of the teleconnection between streamflow and the warm (El Nino) phase of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, we found a strong relationship evident in four regions of the United States: the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast, the North Central, and the Pacific Northwest. In this present study we have examined the same four regions for a relationship between streamflow and the cold (La Nina) phase of the Southern Oscillation (SO). Invariably, we found evidence of strong and consistent streamflow responses to La Nina events within the study regions. In each of the four regions, the strongest La Nina signal occurred at the same time of year as had the El Nino signal in their respective years. The sign of the seasonal streamflow anomaly associated with the La Nina events is the opposite of that associated with the El Nino events. This documents the existence of the biennial tendency related to the SO in the streamflow anomaly, which is expected, since La Nina/El Nino are opposite phases of the ENSO cycle. Finally, the relationships between streamflow and La Nina/El Nino were found to be statistically significant, based on the hypergeometric distribution. The results of this study demonstrate coherent, consistent, and significant midlatitude streamflow responses to the tropical SO phenomenon. This confirms the results of previous climatological studies that have examined the extratropical teleconnections from a hydrological and meteorological perspective.

AB A pore network model is used to describe constitutive relationships between saturation, capillary pressure, relative permeabilities, and interfacial areas over the full range of saturations. We focus on residual nonwetting-phase saturations, that is, the saturation range between main drainage and primary drainage. Interphase mass transfer and dynamic miscible transport are modeled to generate the range of saturations over which the extended constitutive relationships are calculated. To accommodate all saturations in a consistent way, we define capillary pressure as the areal average of local capillary pressures associated with each fluid-fluid interface. The extended constitutive relationships provide input for continuum-scale models covering the entire saturation range and indicate that special care is needed in the general formulation of continuum-scale equations.

AB The "water wars" between Alabama, Georgia, and Florida over water restrictions and allocation in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin (ACF) stem, in part, from the occurrence of several droughts in the 1980s, the dramatic increase in water use in the northern basin around Atlanta, and increased agricultural usage in the central basin. This study examines relationships between available surface climatological variables connected to evapotranspiration and climatic oscillations using canonical correlation analysis (CCA).
   Canonical loadings and cross loadings from CCA are evaluated in two tests using temperature and precipitation data and four climate oscillations - the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). In the first test, the six-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and all four seasons of the four climate oscillations from every subbasin in the ACF are evaluated, revealing relationships mostly with the AMO and NAO, and primarily with temperatures. In order to focus more on precipitation and the variance among the different temporal scales of the SPI, Test Two looks at the relationship between all four SPI variations and all four seasons of the climate oscillations from the extreme northern and southern subbasins. Test Two shows the twenty-four month SPI has the largest loadings and variance explained, which may be contributed to the longer frequencies in the AMO and PDO. The southern part of the basin is largely influenced by SOI, while the northern subbasin the AMO and PDO. Concurrent relationships between the same season of the climate oscillation and meteorological variable confirm previously researched directions of the relationships between the oscillation and precipitation or temperature in both Test One and Test Two.
