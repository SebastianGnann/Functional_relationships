AB In this paper we compare the theory developed in Part I (Adv. Water Resour., 19 (1996) 29-47) with numerical experiments for transient, one-dimensional (in the large-scale averaged sense) flow in nodular and stratified systems, The comparison is limited to systems that are isotropic at the Darcy scale, and that are relatively simple when compared to the complex nature of most geological systems. Good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained, and this suggests that the simplifications made in the development of the three closure problems are acceptable. The closure problems have been used to calculate the permeability tensors and the exchange coefficient for a wide range of conditions of practical importance.

TI MASS CONSERVATIVE NUMERICAL-SOLUTIONS OF THE HEAD-BASED RICHARDS
   EQUATION
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID UNSATURATED FLOW; MODELS
AB Numerical procedures for efficient mass conservative solutions of the head-based form of the Richards equation are presented. Mass conservative solutions are shown to result when the capacity coefficient, C, is formulated by equating the storage term and its chain rule expansion in their discretized forms. Equivalence in the storage term expansion is maintained in finite difference models when C is evaluated with a standard chord slope approximation. This scheme is shown to produce excellent global mass balance accuracy in simulations of vertical moisture infiltration, An analogous approach to the expansion of the storage term using finite elements results in element dependent expressions of C. Application of this approach produces mass balance accuracy with errors less than 1%, but also exhibits slow convergence in the consistent form. A nontraditional finite element procedure is presented which maintains equivalence in the storage term expansion when C is evaluated with the standard chord slope approximation. This scheme exhibits excellent mass balance accuracy, in either the consistent or lumped forms, without significant loss in computational efficiency.

AB Geoscience communication is becoming increasingly important as climate change increases the occurrence of natural hazards around the world. Few geoscientists are trained in effective science communication, and awareness of the formal science communication literature is also low. This can be challenging when interacting with journalists on a powerful medium like TV. To provide geoscience communicators with background knowledge on effective science communication on television, we reviewed relevant theory in the context of geosciences and discuss six major themes: scientist motivation, target audience, narratives and storytelling, jargon and information transfer, relationship between scientists and journalists, and stereotypes of scientists on TV. We illustrate each theme with a case study of geosciences on TV and discuss relevant science communication literature. We then highlight how this literature applies to the geosciences and identify knowledge gaps related to science communication in the geosciences. As TV offers a unique opportunity to reach many viewers, we hope this review can not only positively contribute to effective geoscience communication but also to the wider geoscience debate in society.

AB Groundwater recharge is one of the important factors determining the groundwater development potential of an area. Even though recharge plays a key role in controlling groundwater system dynamics, much uncertainty remains regarding the relationships between groundwater recharge and its governing factors at a large scale. Therefore, this study aims to identify the most influential factors of groundwater recharge, and to develop an empirical model to estimate diffuse rainfall recharge at a global scale. Recharge estimates reported in the literature from various parts of the world (715 sites) were compiled and used in model building and testing exercises. Unlike conventional recharge estimates from water balance, this study used a multimodel inference approach and information theory to explain the relationship between groundwater recharge and influential factors, and to predict groundwater recharge at 0.5 degrees resolution. The results show that meteorological factors (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) and vegetation factors (land use and land cover) had the most predictive power for recharge. According to the model, long-term global average annual recharge (1981-2014) was 134 mm yr(-1) with a prediction error ranging from -8 to 10 mm yr(-1) for 97.2% of cases. The recharge estimates presented in this study are unique and more reliable than the existing global groundwater recharge estimates because of the extensive validation carried out using both independent local estimates collated from the literature and national statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In a water-scarce future driven by increased anthropogenic development, the results from this study will aid in making informed decisions about groundwater potential at a large scale.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID WATER; TRANSPORT; SEDIMENT; CHANNEL; MODEL; SOIL
AB A theoretical analysis of the exchange of nonsorbing solutes between a permeable streambed and the overlying water of a stream or river is presented in this paper. In a companion paper [Elliott nod Brooks, this issue] the results of experimental studies of such exchange are presented. The analysis focuses on water movements into, within, and out of the bed which result from the presence of bed forms (ripples and dunes) and highlights the mechanisms of ''pumping'' and ''turnover.'' Pumping is the movement of fluid through the bed induced by steady dynamic pressure variations over bed forms. Turnover occurs as moving bed forms trap and release interstitial fluid. The detailed analysis was used to generate the distribution of the residence time of solute within the bed, which can be used to calculate the net mass exchange due to pumping and turnover.

ID STOCHASTIC-ANALYSIS
AB When a natural porous medium is viewed from an eulerian perspective, incomplete characterization of the hydraulic conductivity, chemical reactivity, and biological activity leads to nonlocal constitutive theories, irrespective of whether the medium has evolving heterogeneity with fluctuations over all scales. Within this framework a constitutive theory involving nonlocal dispersive and convective Fluxes and nonlocal sources/sinks is developed for chemicals undergoing random linear nonequilibrium reactions and random equilibrium first-order decay in a random conductivity field. The resulting transport equations are solved exactly in Fourier-Laplace space and then numerically inverted to real space. Mean concentration contours and various spatial moments are presented graphically for several covariance structures. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper addresses the hydroclimatic modeling of mountain front recharge to regional aquifers. An analytical relationship between the mean seasonal precipitation and runoff is obtained based on a conceptualization of the hydrologic processes occurring in hard rock mountainous terrain and a derived-distribution approach where the input variables are considered to be stochastic and their probability distributions are transformed into the probability distribution of the output variable by using the deterministic physical process. In a first-order approximation a relationship between the seasonal values of precipitation and runoff is obtained. An analytical model of the seasonal streamflow is then developed where initial abstraction and the long-term effective subsurface outflow, or mountain front recharge, are viewed as unknown model parameters. In addition, a procedure that combines the water balance equation with a relationship provided by the so-called ''vegetal equilibrium hypothesis,'' and which enables the estimation of effective soil-related parameters jointly with the mean seasonal evapotranspiration and surface runoff, is introduced. This procedure is applied to a mountainous watershed in southern Arizona.

TI WATER MARKETING AS A REALLOCATIVE INSTITUTION IN TEXAS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Policy selection for guiding the allocation of water resources has long been debated among economists and policymakers.  Economists have been prone to recommend water marketing on theoretical grounds, but the appraisal of realistic opportunities for employing market institutions requires analysis of actual markets.  Twenty years of market activity in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas are reviewed along with the historical development of water law in Texas and procedural requirements for transferring water rights.  Developed data indicate active water marketing practices with significant volumes of agricultural water having been sold to municipalities.  For transactions involving representative cities, estimated municipal benefits from water marketing are determined to far exceed the agricultural costs of the transfer.  Attention to the unique circumstances of this region is required prior to extending results to other areas.

AB Synchronous patterns of variation in NO(3) concentration, observed in upland lakes and streams across gradients of climate, altitude, land use and nitrogen deposition over the last decade, show a strong negative correlation with winter values for the North Atlantic Oscillation Index and mean winter temperature. Variations in a longer term stream NO(3) record validate this relationship, and although mechanisms are yet unclear, may be linked to the length of time the soil profile remains frozen during the winter. These findings are of particular significance to our understanding of the relationship between atmospheric N deposition and concentrations and fluxes of NO(3) in runoff, and the potential response to future climatic changes.

AB [1] This paper reports on a routing method to estimate values of four parameters of a transient storage (TS) model that represent solute transport in natural streams with transient storage zones. In this approach a functional relationship between the TS model parameters and an analytical solution of the TS model equation is constructed. Results from a robust constrained nonlinear equation solver are used to obtain an explicit relationship between the mixing data and the terms in the functional relationship. The new method and several existing methods are compared with independently observed values of the TS model parameters. Laboratory flume experiments show that the parameters estimated by the new method are in better agreement with observations than are earlier methods. TS model parameters of 58 mixing data sets obtained from 33 natural streams are estimated. Dispersion data show that the concentration curves from analytical solutions using parameters estimated by the new method provide a good match to the observed concentration curves.

ID QUANTILE ESTIMATORS; APPRAISAL; REGION
AB Pooling of flood data is widely used to provide a framework to estimate design floods by the Index Flood method. Design flood estimation with this approach involves derivation of a growth curve which shows the relationship between X-T and the return period T, where X-T = Q(T)/Q(I) and Q(I) is the index flood at the site of interest. An implicit assumption with the Index Flood procedure of pooling analysis is that the X-T-T relationship is the same at all sites in a homogeneous pooling group, although this assumption would generally be violated to some extent in practical cases, i.e. some degree of heterogeneity exists. In fact, in only some cases is the homogeneity criterion effectively satisfied for Irish conditions. In this paper, the performance of the index-flood pooling analysis is assessed in the Irish low CV (coefficient of variation) hydrology context considering that heterogeneity is taken into account. It is found that the performance of the pooling method is satisfactory provided there are at least 350 station years of data included. Also it is found that, in a highly heterogeneous group, it is more desirable to have many sites with short record lengths than a smaller number of sites with long record lengths. Increased heterogeneity decreases the advantage of pooling group-based estimation over at-site estimation. Only a heterogeneity measure (H1) less than 4.0 can render the pooled estimation preferable to that obtained for at-site estimation for the estimation of 100-year flood. In moderately to highly heterogeneous regions it is preferable to conduct at-site analysis for the estimation of 100-year flood if the record length at the site concerned exceeds 50.

ID SUBSURFACE STORMFLOW; FLOW; LAYER
AB Theory is developed for hillslope drainage and is applied to the condition of sudden drawdown at the aquifer outlet. The equations for prediction of cumulative outflow volume, flow rate, and water table profile are based on the Boussinesq approximation for subsurface water flow above a sloping impermeable. layer. The advantages of the theory presented here am that the assumption of a long, thin aquifer is unnecessary; the same equations apply to both sloping and horizontal aquifers; and the equations contain only parameters that are easily measured or estimated: slope, drainable porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and layer thickness. The accuracy of the outflow equations is illustrated by a series of laboratory experiments.

AB Assessment of the reliability of the operation policy of a single dam was investigated. The methodology was based on implicit stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) of dry events. Several performance indices were used and a supplementary indicator, the number of deficits observed, was also considered. This study was carried Out on hydrological data of 1985-2005 and the chronology of the operation of Ghezala Dam in northern Tunisia. The daily rainfall records for the period 1968-2005 were used in the identification of the dry and rainfall events according to a predetermined threshold value. A threshold equal to the average daily evapotranspiration in the area was selected. It was calculated from the data during the same period. The events time series extracted was used to generate several synthetic events time series. The rainfall events sequences were coupled with a rainfall-runoff model (production function of the runoff) to obtain synthetic streamflow series. Each synthetic streamflow sequence, obtained from synthetic rainfall events sequences and that derived from the historic rainfall events time series, was optimized and an optimal decision was formulated. These optimal decisions were examined to derive the operating rules of a reservoir for dry events. The comparison among all performance indices (IP) reveals that the occurrence-based reliability, IP(3) seems to be a weak indicator because it informs badly about the situation of the reservoir operation. Moreover, this indices only describes how the deficit and the non-deficit periods are distributed within the entire simulation time period. Time-based reliability, IP(2), and average inter-arrival times (mean length of a failure event), IP(5), seem to be comparable. The probability of not having any deficits during a rainfall event is about 0.90, whereas during a dry event, it is 0.81. The results presented clearly demonstrate that performance indicators play an essential role in the complete assessment of reservoir management.

   THEORY
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DRAINAGE
AB This paper presents a model of the long-term evolution of cathchments, the growth of their drainage networks,and the changes in elevations within both the channels and the hillslopes. Elevation changes are determined from continuity equations for flow and sediment transport, with sediment transport being related to discharge and slope. The central feature of the model is that it explicitly differentiates between the sediment transport behavior of the channels and the hillslopes on the basis of observed physics, and the channel network extension results solely from physically based flow interactions on the hillslopes. The difference in behavior of channels and hillslopes is one of the most important properties of a catchment. The flow and sediment transport continuity equations in the channel and the hillslope are coupled and account for the long-term interactions of the elevations in the hillslope and in the channels. Sediment transport can be due to fluvial processes, creep, and rockslides. Tectonic uplift may increase overall catchment elevations. The dynamics of channel head advance, and thus network growth, are modeled using a physically based mechanism for channel initiation and growth where a channel head advances when a channel initiation function, nonlinearly dependent on discharge and slope, exceeds a threshold. This threshold controls the drainage density of the basin. A computer implementation of the model is introduced, some simple simulations presented, and the numerics of the solution technique described.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID PARAMETER
AB A statistical approach based on the modified Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulses model is presented to disaggregate rainfall statistics from daily data. Six model parameters are estimated from 24- and 48-hour accumulated rainfall data. Based on these estimated parameters, in addition to reproducing 24- and 48-hour statistics, the model is shown to infer 1-, 2-, 6-, and 12-hour historical statistics satisfactorily. An upper limit for disaggregation scale (about 2 days) for this model has been identified. This characteristic behavior of the model is related to the power law dependence of the power spectrum for timescales smaller than 2 days. A detailed comparison between observed and modeled statistics of rainfall data is presented for two rain gages, one from central Italy and the other from the midwestern United States.

   FRACTURE OF VARIABLE ROUGHNESS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CHANNEL MODEL; TRACER TRANSPORT; FLOW; APERTURE; MEDIA; TESTS
AB Several authors have recently expressed interest in chemical transport within fractured media. The majority of these efforts have been based on a linear relationship between the dispersion coefficient and the average fluid velocity within the fracture. It is not apparent that this relationship is fully justified in all applications. For the present study, it is assumed (as suggested by authors working in porous media) that the dispersion coefficient is proportional to the velocity raised to a power, n. Further, it is assumed that transport within the fracture follows classic advection-dispersion behavior (e.g., Fickian dispersion). The present study focuses on the value of the power n in a series of artificial fractures. In particular, an experimental apparatus is utilized to run controlled tracer experiments through a single fracture. When the fracture consists of smooth parallel plates, the results from the experiments indicate that the dispersion coefficient is proportional to the velocity squared (consistent with the early work by Taylor (1953) for transport dominated by transverse diffusion). As the fracture roughness is increased through use of blockages within the fracture and/or addition of surface roughness along the fracture walls, the relationship between dispersion and velocity varied. For each fracture roughness, the results followed the general relationship in which dispersion is proportional to velocity raised to the power n. The power n, however, was strongly dependent on the fracture roughness, taking on a value of 2.0 for smooth parallel plates and decreasing to a value of approximately 1.3 for rough plates.

AB Drainage density reflects the signature of climate on the topography and dictates the boundary conditions for surface hydrology. Hence defining the relationship between drainage density and climate is important in assessing the sensitivity of water resources and hydrology to climate change. Here we analyze the equilibrium relationship between drainage density and climate and estimate the relative sensitivity of drainage density to climate change. We conclude that the sign of the resulting change in drainage density depends not only on the direction of the change in climate but also on the prevailing climatic regime.

DT Article
ID CALIFORNIA; RUNOFF; PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL; FOREST; SNOW; US
AB Multi-year droughts in Mediterranean climates may shift the water balance, that is, the partitioning rule of precipitation across runoff, evapotranspiration, and subsurface storage. Mechanisms causing these shifts remain largely unknown and are not well represented in hydrologic models. Focusing on measurements from the headwaters of California's Feather River, we found that also in these mixed rain-snow Mediterranean basins a lower fraction of precipitation was partitioned to runoff during multi-year droughts compared to non-drought years. This shift in the precipitation-runoff relationship was larger in the surface-runoff-dominated than subsurface-flow-dominated headwaters (-39% vs. -18% decline of runoff, respectively, for a representative precipitation amount). The predictive skill of the Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) hydrologic model in these basins decreased during droughts, with evapotranspiration (ET) being the only water-balance component besides runoff for which the drop in predictive skill during drought vs. non-drought years was statistically significant. In particular, the model underestimated the response time required by ET to adjust to interannual climate variability, which we define as climate elasticity of ET. Differences between simulated and data-driven estimates of ET were well correlated with accompanying data-driven estimates of changes in sub-surface storage (Delta S, r = 0.78). This correlation points to shifts in precipitation-runoff relationships being evidence of a hysteretic response of the water budget to climate elasticity of ET during and after multi-year droughts. This hysteresis is caused by carryover storage offsetting precipitation deficit during the initial drought period, followed by vegetation mortality when storage is depleted and subsequent post-drought vegetation expansion. Our results point to a general improvement in hydrologic predictions across drought and recovery cycles by including the climate elasticity of ET and better accounting for actual subsurface water storage in not only soil, but also deeper regolith that stores water accessible to roots. This can be done by explicitly parametrizing carryover storage and feedback mechanisms capturing vegetation response to atmospheric demand for moisture. followed by vegetation mortality when storage is depleted and subsequent post-drought vegetation expansion.

ID DESIGN
AB Detention reservoirs in urban drainage systems are provided for reducing the peak flows downstream of the reservoir.  The flow reduction is due to the storage volume of the reservoir in which the incoming flow is temporarily stored.  The relationship between the peak reduction ratio (the peak outflow discharge to the peak inflow discharge) and the relative storage ratio (maximum volume stored in the reservoir to the volume of the inflow hydrograph) is evaluated in this study.  This relationship, named the efficiency function, is derived by a numerical solution of the dimensionless routing equation.  Using the three-parameter gamma distribution to represent the inflow to the reservoir, the efficiency functions can be expressed by simple linear equations.  Each equation depends on a single parameter whose value is determined by the reservoir configuration (depth-storage relationship) and the type of the outlet device (e.g., spillway or culvert).  The implementation of the efficiency function is most suitable for the preliminary design stage where a large number of alternative designs can be easily tested without performing the conventional routing procedure.

AB In spite of the important relationship between sediment particle size and the transport/deposition of adsorbed pollutants in fluvial systems, little information regarding the size characteristics of suspended sediment transported by southern Ontario Great Lakes tributaries is currently available.  This paper examines long-term sediment and hydrometric data collected by the Water Resources Branch of Environment Canada in order to provide information on (1) typical particle size distributions of suspended sediment, (2) relationships between source material and particle size characteristics of suspended sediment, and (3) temporal variation in the particle size characteristics of suspended sediment from six southern Ontario rivers.  Results illustrate the complex behaviour and variability of sediment particle size transport in these rivers and demonstrate the need for a better understanding of seasonal effects on sediment availability and conveyance processes in fluvial systems.

ID MULTIFRACTAL ANALYSIS; FIELDS
AB The importance of high-resolution rainfall data to understand the intricacies of the dynamics of hydrological processes and describe them in a sophisticated and accurate way has been increasingly realized. The present study investigates the general suitability of fractal (or scaling) theory for understanding the rainfall behaviour and transforming rainfall data from one time scare to another. The study, employing a multi-fractal approach, follows the research undertaken earlier by the author (Sivakumar, 2000) employing a mono-fractal approach in which some preliminary indication as to the possibility of existence of (multi-) fractals was obtained. Rainfall data of three different resolutions, six-hourly, daily, and weekly, observed over a period of 25 years in two different climatic regions: a subtropical climatic region (Leaf River basin, Mississippi, USA); and an equatorial climatic region (Singapore) are analysed. The existence of multi-fractal behaviour in the rainfall data is investigated using (a) the power spectrum method; (b) the empirical probability distribution function (PDF) method; (c) the statistical moment scaling method; and (d) the probability distribution multiple scaling (PDMS) method. The results achieved from all these methods for the six different rainfall data sets considered indicate the existence of multi-fractal behaviour of rainfall observed in Leaf River basin and Singapore, providing further support to the results obtained using the mono-fractal approach (Sivakumar, 2000). The suitability of a multi-fractal framework to characterize the behaviour of rainfall observed in the above two significantly different climatic regions, subtropical and equatorial, seems to suggest the general suitability of the fractal theory for transforming rainfall from one time scale to another. Investigations with rainfall data from several other climatic regions are underway with a view to strengthening the above conclusions.

ID PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; RESILIENCE; SYSTEM; VULNERABILITY; RELIABILITY;
   SINGLE; MODEL
AB A methodology has been developed to determine the optimal operating horizon for short-term reservoir operation.  The modelling procedure includes: (1) an adaptive forecasting algorithm; (2) a real-time reservoir operation model; (3) a multiobjective compromise programming algorithm.  The compromise programming algorithm utilizes a multiobjective compromise between the conflicting objectives of hydrologic forecast reliability and reservoir operation penalties.  The algorithm requires predetermined weights defining the relative importance of the two objectives.  This paper presents a risk-based methodology developed to help a decision maker in selecting the appropriate weights.  Reliability, vulnerability, and resiliency are used as three risk-based criteria for assisting in selection of the weights.  The methodology is presented in the form of a rule-based system designed to aid the user in the selection process.  The methodology is illustrated through an application of the technique to the operation of Green Reservoir in Kentucky.  The reservoir model is implemented for four different historical periods and its performance in terms of total penalties, reliability, vulnerability, and resiliency is presented as a function of the multi-objective weighting parameters.  The rule-based expert system is then used for deriving recommendations regarding the selection of appropriate weights.  The paper also discusses the rule-based expert system development tool, used in this research.

AB Erosion and solid transport processes in the basins of Mediterranean semi-arid zones have interested a great number of hydrologists, whose studies have increased in the last ten years with the aim of understanding and explaining the mechanisms, their causes and their consequences. In this context, we attempt to show, by means of in situ measurements, the relationship between water discharge and sediment discharge. A statistical model was developed using water discharge data of selected floods. The results obtained at Mekerra station (Sidi Ali Benyoub, Algeria) are very encouraging, as the coefficients of correlation of both annual and seasonal water discharge to sediment discharge vary from 0.90 to 0.91.

AB Streamflow data from 12 international rivers were used to develop predictive relationships for total (i.e. within-year plus over-year) reservoir capacity as well as the within-year capacity adjustment for use during reservoir planning. The models were then validated using data from three other international rivers. In general, it was found that the performance, during both calibration and validation, of the combined capacity model was better than that of the within-year capacity adjustment model. The two models are applicable only if an estimate of the over-year capacity is available. Methods of independently estimating the over-year capacity, as well as the other derived factors used as independent variables in the regression models, are described for gauged and ungauged sites.

AB River flows connect people, places, and other forms of life, inspiring and sustaining diverse cultural beliefs, values, and ways of life. The concept of environmental flows provides a framework for improving understanding of relationships between river flows and people, and for supporting those that are mutually beneficial. Nevertheless, most approaches to determining environmental flows remain grounded in the biophysical sciences. The newly revised Brisbane Declaration and Global Action Agenda on Environmental Flows (2018) represents a new phase in environmental flow science and an opportunity to better consider the co-constitution of river flows, ecosystems, and society, and to more explicitly incorporate these relationships into river management. We synthesize understanding of relationships between people and rivers as conceived under the renewed definition of environmental flows. We present case studies from Honduras, India, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia that illustrate multidisciplinary, collaborative efforts where recognizing and meeting diverse flow needs of human populations was central to establishing environmental flow recommendations. We also review a small body of literature to highlight examples of the diversity and interdependencies of human-flow relationships-such as the linkages between river flow and human well-being, spiritual needs, cultural identity, and sense of place-that are typically overlooked when environmental flows are assessed and negotiated. Finally, we call for scientists and water managers to recognize the diversity of ways of knowing, relating to, and utilizing rivers, and to place this recognition at the center of future environmental flow assessments.

AB This study investigates the interactions of water, oxygen, temperature, suspended sediment and topsoil texture of bedwork watermeadows. These ancient grassland irrigation systems survive on the floodplain around Salisbury, England but recent interest in their conservation and rehabilitation is not matched by detailed understanding of their operation. The dominant 'bedwork' form, by which water runs along the top of ridges and down 'panes', enables water to move swiftly through the sward and drain to avoid stagnation. This investigation demonstrates that condition of surface flow and rates of infiltration encourage the solution of atmospheric oxygen in the water, offsetting potentially anaerobic conditions in the root zone. Temperature conditions imparted by the flow were measured and found to be conducive to the early growth of grass. Whereas the sediment budget was found to be conservative under a steady-state hydraulic regime, there is substantial ingress of suspended sediment at the start of an irrigation event and the sward traps coarse to medium-sized silt particle fractions and influences topsoil texture. It is concluded that a study of watermeadow operation permits insights into the operation of floodplain processes in general. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Simple hydraulic models for outflow of groundwater into a stream suggest that the form of the storage-discharge relationship for groundwater changes from linear, for a confined aquifer, to quadratic, for an unconfined flow. Tests of the form of stream flow recessions in 11 streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments the storage-discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage-discharge relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another, attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An extension of the linear model to 'leaky' catchments, where the recession reaches zero flow, has been tested on two data sets.
   The second part of the paper deals with algorithms for baseflow during surface runoff events - the problem of hydrograph separation. Algorithms with one, two and three parameters have been compared, using data for the same 11 streams, and the results show significant differences in the baseflow index (BFI) predicted for some catchments. The two-parameter algorithm, which is fitted subjectively, is more consistent in providing plausible results than either the one- or three-parameter algorithms, both of which can be fitted objectively.

AB During dry weather periods of the year with long rainless intervals, streams slacken to what is generally termed "low flow". This work presents an analysis of the influence of hydrogeology on low flows, using multiple linear regression, in natural medium and small streams in hilly and mountainous regions of Serbia. The study cases encompass 61 gauged catchments south of the rivers Sava and Danube. Characteristic relevant minimum mean 30-day flows of 80- or 95-percentile exceedence (Q(80%), Q(95%)) are taken as dependent variables. Independent variables are the observable hydrogeological quantities: catchment area upstream of a gauging station; surface area of a hydrogeological soil category in a catchment; number of perennial springs of minimum flow higher than or equal to 1 L/s in a gauged catchment; number of perennial springs, each of minimum flow higher than or equal to 1 L/s, in a given hydrogeological soil category of the catchment; cumulative perennial spring flow of minimum single flow higher than or equal to 1 L/s in a catchment; and cumulative perennial spring flow of minimum single flow higher than or equal to 1 L/s in a hydrogeological soil category of a catchment. Through multiple linear regression between the characteristic relevant low flow and the hydrogeological elements, 16 models are developed and analysed, each based on a different combination of hydrogeological elements and characteristic low flow. The regional relationships developed for the minimum mean 30-day flows of 80- and 95-percentile exceedences are evaluated. The statistical tests of the representation quality of each multiple regression relationship show that the models justify the use of hydrogeological elements.

AB By analysing the hydrographs of karst springs it is possible to identify aquifer characteristics and, accordingly, the main features of a karst rock-fissure massif. Consequently, relevant data can be obtained by analysing hydrograph recession curves. This paper presents a detailed analysis and explanation of numerous cases of break points on recession curves via various values of the recession coefficient alpha in Maillet's (1905) equation. The paper also identifies the relationship between alpha and a linear reservoir coefficient by employing groundwater hydrograph methods. It is shown that the linear reservoir coefficient changes with time in accordance with changes of the flow conditions in the karst massif.

AB Detailed field measurements of channel properties and flow characteristics collected in the Ashley and Cropp catchments (New Zealand) are used to investigate the spatial variation of resistance to flow across upland channel networks. The application of the Darcy-Weisbach equation and semilogarithmic flow resistance relationships reveals that mean flow velocities calculated from local measurements of bed material particle size, hydraulic depth, and channel bed slope may be inaccurate. The Manning-Gauckler-Strickler equation with resistance coefficient independent of bed material particle size is found to be relatively more reliable but not sufficiently general to reproduce the spatial variation of resistance to flow across a complex channel network. A new methodology is developed by combining a hydraulic equation of the Manning-Gauckler-Strickler type, a flow discharge-upstream drainage area relationship, and geomorphological fluvial relationships for mean flow velocity, Gauckler-Strickler resistance coefficient, hydraulic depth, and friction slope. This methodology is found to improve the reproduction of the spatial variation of mean flow velocity across the Ashley catchment and appears of general applicability for the parameterization of resistance to flow in distributed catchment models.

   GOETHITE; BATCH
AB We present a convective description of acid-base transport in porous media which is based on classical one-component nonlinear chromatographic theory applied to the acidity of the system. In the mobile phase the solution acidity is given by c = [H+]t - [OH-]t, where [H+]t and [OH-]t are the total solution concentrations of H+ and OH-, respectively. In the stationary phase the surface acidity corresponds to the charge density sigma, which is commonly presented as a function of pH of the solution. The response of a chromatographic column to a step pH change at column inlet results in a pH breakthrough curve which consists of a combined chromatographic front. This combined front begins with a diffuse subfront and ends with a self-sharpening subfront. The present chromatographic theory is used to predict experimentally observed pH breakthrough curves for columns filled with materials of known pH-dependent charging behavior. Good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results is observed. Essentially, the same chromatographic theory is used to explain pH breakthrough curves when the salinity of the input solution is changed. This situation leads usually to an additional nonretarded front where a change in pH occurs.

AB Using 94 years of monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) data for 344 climate divisions, this study investigates the hydroclimatic response in the United States to the extreme phases of the Southern Oscillation (El Nino and La Nina). Several regions of coherent response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are identified. The strongest relationship between El Nino and extreme drought years is found in the Pacific Northwest. A strong relationship is also noticed in the southern United States, where dry conditions occur consistently during La Nina events. Next, the conditional response in PDSI is evaluated based on the extreme phases of the Southern Oscillation. The PDSI results were compared to similar analyses on 41 years of station temperature, precipitation, and streamflow data. A consistent response is seen in the other hydroclimatic variables, though the most filtered response is seen in PDSI data and streamflow data. The major contribution to the understanding of the ENSO-United States climate relationship is the evaluation of the general form of drought and comparison of these results to the fundamental hydrologic processes (precipitation, temperature, and streamflow).

AB Major multi-reservoir cascades represent a primary mechanism for dealing with hydrologic variability and extremes within institutionally complex river basins worldwide. These coordinated management processes fundamentally reshape water balance dynamics. Yet, multi-reservoir coordination processes have been largely ignored in the increasingly sophisticated representations of reservoir operations within large-scale hydrological models. The aim of this paper is twofold, namely (i) to provide evidence that the common modeling practice of parameterizing each reservoir in a cascade independently from the others is a significant approximation and (ii) to demonstrate potential unintended consequences of this independence approximation when simulating the dynamics of hydrological extremes in complex reservoir cascades. We explore these questions using the Water Balance Model, which features detailed representations of the human infrastructure coupled to the natural processes that shape water balance dynamics. It is applied to the Upper Snake River basin in the western US and its heavily regulated multi-reservoir cascade. We employ a time-varying sensitivity analysis that utilizes the method of Morris factor screening to explicitly track how the dominant release rule parameters evolve both along the cascade and in time according to seasonal high- and low-flow events. This enables us to address aim (i) by demonstrating how the progressive and cumulative dominance of upstream releases significantly dampens the ability of downstream reservoir rules' parameters to influence flow conditions. We address aim (ii) by comparing simulation results with observed reservoir operations during critical low-flow and high-flow events in the basin. Our time-varying parameter sensitivity analysis with the method of Morris clarifies how independent single-reservoir parameterizations and their tacit assumption of independence leads to reservoir release behaviors that generate artificial water shortages and flooding, whereas the observed coordinated cascade operations avoided these outcomes for the same events. To further explore the role of (non-)coordination in the large deviations from the observed operations, we use an offline multi-reservoir water balance model in which adding basic coordination mechanisms drawn from the observed emergency operations is sufficient to correct the deficiencies of the independently parameterized reservoir rules from the hydrological model. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the state-space context in which reservoir releases occur and where operational coordination plays a crucial role in avoiding or mitigating water-related extremes. Understanding how major infrastructure is coordinated and controlled in major river basins is essential for properly assessing future flood and drought hazards in a changing world.

AB The analytical solution of the overland flow equations developed by Agnese et al. (2001; Hydrological Processes 15: 3225-3238) for rectangular straight hillslopes was extended to convergent and divergent surfaces and to concave and convex profiles. Towards this aim, the conical convergent and divergent surfaces are approximated by a trapezoidal shape, and the overland flow is assumed to be always one-dimensional. A simple 'shape factor' accounting for both planform geometry and profile shape was introduced: for each planform geometry, a brachistochrone profile was obtained by minimizing a functional containing a slope function of the profile. Minima shape factors are associated with brachistochrones; interestingly, brachistochrones associated with rectangular surfaces have a simple power-law form. For a fixed profile shape, the rapidness of overland flow increases with the degree of divergence; for a fixed planform geometry, however, the overland flow associated with convex profiles is more rapid than that associated with concave profiles. An extended analytical solution is also proposed for the instantaneous response function. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Two-phase flows in which the pressure profile is essentially constant are called quasi-steady.  One-dimensional quasi-steady flows have the remarkable property that volumetric flux is essentially independent of position and is a function of time alone.  Such volumetric fluxes are (to within an additive constant) inversely proportional to the spatial mean value of flowing viscosity.  Consequently, the evolution of such a system is controlled by global properties of viscosity.  Vertical two-phase quasi-steady flows evolving from an initial steady flow to another final steady flow are analyzed, and the corresponding theory is matched to output from a numerical simulator.  Good agreement between the theory and simulator is demonstrated for simple shocks and expansion waves.

AB Besides floodplains, hillslopes are basic units that mainly control water movement and flow pathways within catchments of subdued mountain ranges. The structure of their shallow subsurface affects water balance, e. g. infiltration, retention, and runoff. Nevertheless, there is still a gap in the knowledge of the hydrological dynamics on hillslopes, notably due to the lack of generalization and transferability. This study presents a robust multi-method framework of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in addition to hydrometric point measurements, transferring hydrometric data into higher spatial scales to obtain additional patterns of distribution and dynamics of soil moisture on a hillslope. A geoelectrical monitoring in a small catchment in the eastern Ore Mountains was carried out at weekly intervals from May to December 2008 to image seasonal moisture dynamics on the hillslope scale. To link water content and electrical resistivity, the parameters of Archie's law were determined using different core samples. To optimize inversion parameters and methods, the derived spatial and temporal water content distribution was compared to tensiometer data. The results from ERT measurements show a strong correlation with the hydrometric data. The response is congruent to the soil tension data. Water content calculated from the ERT profile shows similar variations as that of water content from soil moisture sensors. Consequently, soil moisture dynamics on the hillslope scale may be determined not only by expensive invasive punctual hydrometric measurements, but also by minimally invasive time-lapse ERT, provided that pedo-/petrophysical relationships are known. Since ERT integrates larger spatial scales, a combination with hydrometric point measurements improves the understanding of the ongoing hydrological processes and better suits identification of heterogeneities.

AB Characterizing the diffusive exchange of solutes between bulk water in an aquifer and water in the intragranular pores of the solid phase is still challenging despite decades of study. Many disparities between observation and theory could be attributed to low connectivity of the intragranular pores. The presence of low connectivity indicates that a useful conceptual framework is percolation theory. The present study was initiated to develop a percolation-based finite difference (FD) model, and to test it rigorously against both random walk (RW) simulations of diffusion starting from nonequilibrium, and data on Borden sand published by Ball and Roberts (1991a,b) and subsequently reanalyzed by Haggerty and Gorelick (1995) using a multirate mass transfer (MRMT) approach. The percolation-theoretical model is simple and readily incorporated into existing FD models. The FD model closely matches the RW results using only a single fitting parameter, across a wide range of pore connectivities. Simulation of the Borden sand experiment without pore connectivity effects reproduced the MRMT analysis, but including low pore connectivity effects improved the fit. Overall, the theory and simulation results show that low intragranular pore connectivity can produce diffusive behavior that appears as if the solute had undergone slow sorption, despite the absence of any sorption process, thereby explaining some hitherto confusing aspects of intragranular diffusion.

AB [ 1] This research develops a zonation-kriging ( ZK) method and extends the geostatistical theory to investigate the spatially distributed random field and obtain an optimal nonsmooth conditional estimate. In the ZK method the zonal structure honors the parameter measurements such that each sample location represents a distinct zone, while the kriging method also honors the same data set and results in a smooth distribution. The ZK method integrates the conditional estimates of the zonal structure and the kriged field over a set of weighting coefficients on the sample data. The extended geostatistical theory using the ZK method is applied to the intrinsic field, stationary field, and nonstationary field. The study shows that the conditional variance using the ZK method is bounded between the kriging variance and variogram. When estimating hydraulic conductivity by inversion of a groundwater model, the optimal values of weighting coefficients are determined via predictive probability of the Bayesian decision theory. The numerical examples show that the ZK method has less dependence on the semivariogram model. The ZK method outperforms the kriging method in both smooth and nonsmooth fields. The ZK method shows high efficiency to better the conditional estimate of hydraulic conductivity distribution with low conditional uncertainty and good agreement to the groundwater head observations.

ID MODELS
AB The theoretical properties of level crossings for stationary Gaussian processes have been applied in the past to model empirical crossing behavior of streamflow data with some success.  However, when the marginal distributions exhibit departures from normality, such as high coefficients of skewness, the theoretical Gaussian results perform poorly in modeling empirical crossing behavior.  In this paper we present theoretical results for crossings of levels by two nin-Gaussian processes, namely, the chi-square process and the lognormal process.  The chi-square process does not appear to have been applied previously in the hydrologic literature.  We apply both models to a skewed annual flow series.  Comparisons with the Gaussian model are made and noticeable improvements are found in both cases.

AB This article places the theorization and analysis of hydro-hegemony in the context of the scholarship on transboundary water conflict and cooperation. We discuss critiques, developments, and debates in this domain over the past 10 years, focusing particularly on the contributions of the London Water Research Group, showing how thinking on the theorization and analysis of hydro-hegemony-and hydropolitics-has moved beyond the state-centricity, the tendency to see hegemony as solely negative, and the conceptually hegemonic potential of hydrohegemony itself. Various strands of international relations theory (realism, neoinstitutionalism, critical theory) have left their mark on the London School. Intense interaction between analysts and pragmatic practitioners is found to invite (or incite) eclecticism as well as promote vibrancy. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI EFFECTIVE WATER-TABLE DEPTH TO DESCRIBE INITIAL CONDITIONS PRIOR TO
   STORM RAINFALL IN HUMID REGIONS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB A physically meaningful technique to determine the effective depth to the water table, as a measure of the initial storage capacity of a basin is developed. The estimation of the initial storage capacity prior to a given flood event is essential to obtain useful results from storm runoff prediction models based on saturation excess overland flow. It is shown how this effective depth to the water table can be related to streamflow measurements at the outlet of the basin. The analysis is based on Boussinesq's standard hydraulic groundwater theory. The main feature of the present formulation is that it allows the estimation of catchment-scale parameters, namely the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and the average depth to the impervious layer. The estimation of these parameters is based on a drought flow analysis which is consistent with the hydraulic groundwater theory used to develop the described technique. This hydraulic theory is found to be applicable for a catchment under humid temperate climatic conditions, namely the Zwalm catchment situated in East-Flanders, Belgium. The results of the proposed analysis are used to estimate the initial conditions in a partial area runoff generation model. It is shown that accurate estimates of total runoff volume are obtained without further calibration of the model.

AB The counterpropagation fuzzy-neural network (CFNN) can effectively solve highly non-linear control problems and robustly tune the complicated conversion of human intelligence to logical operating system. We propose the CFNN for extracting flood control knowledge in the form of fuzzy if-then rules to simulate a human-like operating strategy in a city flood control system through storm events. The Yu-Cheng pumping station, Taipei City, is used as a case study, where storm and operating records are used to train and verify the model's performance. Historical records contain information of rainfall amounts, inner water levels, and pump and gate operating records in torrential rain events. Input information can be classified according to its similarity and mapped into the hidden layer to form precedent if-then rules, while the output layer gradually adjusts the linked weights to obtain the optimal operating result. A model with increasing historical, data can automatically increase rules and thus enhance its predicting ability. The results indicate the network has a simple basic structure with efficient learning ability to construct a human-like operating strategy and has the potential ability to automatically operating the flood control system.

AB A general parametric correlation for estimating snowmelt infiltration into frozen soils is developed using the results from a numerical model, HAWTS. This model includes a set of partial differential equations that describe water and heat transport with phase changes in frozen soils. The model was run for soils with average textures ranging from sandy loam to clay.
   The relationship proposed relates infiltration to the total soil moisture saturation (water + ice) and temperature at the start of snow ablation, the soil surface saturation during melting, and the infiltration opportunity time - the time that meltwater is available at the soil surface for infiltration. The expression is calibrated to predict snowmelt infiltration in boreal forest and prairie environments. Comparisons of estimates of infiltration by the empirical relationship with those determined by field measurement suggest that the correlation will provide acceptable estimates of snowmelt infiltration into frozen mineral soils for use in operational hydrology schemes.

DT Article
ID IMAGING RADAR; FLOODS; LEVEL
AB Analysis of 41 ERS 1 synthetic aperture radar images and simultaneous ground measurements of discharge for three large braided rivers indicates that the area of active flow on braided river floodplains is primarily a function of discharge. A power law correlation is found between satellite-derived effective width W-e and discharge Q, where W-e is the water surface area within a braided reach divided by the reach length. Synthetic values of W-e and Q generated from a cellular automata model of stream braiding display a similar power law correlation. Power functions that are fit through plots of W-e and Q represent satellite-derived rating curves that can subsequently be used to estimate instantaneous river discharge from space, with errors ranging from tens to hundreds of cubic meters per second. For ungaged rivers, changes in relative discharge can be determined from satellite data alone to determine the shape and timing of annual flows in glacierized basins. Absolute discharge can probably be estimated within a factor of 2. More accurate estimates will require either (1) one or more ground measurements of discharge-acquired simultaneously with a satellite image acquisition, or (2) successful parameterization of known morphologic controls such as total sinuosity Sigma P, valley slope, bank material and stability, and braid channel hydraulic geometry. Values of total sinuosity Sigma P derived from satellite imagery and field measurements from two rivers of braid channel width, depth, velocity, water surface slope, and bed material grain size indicate that while the shape of satellite-derived W-e-Q rating curves may be influenced by all of these variables, the sensitivity of flow area to changing discharge is most dependent upon the degree of braiding. Efforts to monitor river discharge from space will be most successful for intensely braided rivers with high values of total sinuosity. Subsampling of existing daily discharge records from the Iskut River suggests that satellite return times of about 1 week are sufficient for approximating the shape and timing of the seasonal hydrograph in large, glacierized basins. Although errors are large, the presented technique represents the only currently available way to estimate discharge in ungauged braided rivers.

AB classical form of the partial differential equation governing advective-dispersive transport of a solute in idealized porous media is the advection-dispersion equation (ADE). This equation is built on a Fickian constitutive theory that gives the local dispersive flux as the inner product of a constant dispersion tensor and the spatial gradient of the solute concentration. Over the past decade, investigators in subsurface transport have been increasingly focused on anomalous (i.e., non-Fickian) dispersion in natural geologic formations. It has been recognized that this phenomenon involves spatial and possibly temporal nonlocality in the constitutive theory describing the dispersive flux. Most recently, several researchers have modeled anomalous dispersion using a constitutive theory that relies on fractional, as opposed to integer, derivatives of the concentration field. The resulting ADE itself is expressed in terms of fractional derivatives, and they are described as "fractional ADEs." Here we show that the fractional ADE is obtained as a special case of the authors' convolution-Fickian nonlocal ADE [Cushman and Ginn, 1.993]. To obtain the fractional ADE from the convolution-Fickian model requires only a judicial choice of the wave vector and frequency-dependent dispersion tensor.

AB The dispersion of a solute plume resulting from unsteady flow in three-dimensional, heterogeneous porous media was analyzed using stochastic continuum theory.  Asymptotic stochastic solutions of the perturbed unsteady flow and solute transport equations were used to construct the macroscopic dispersive flux and evaluate the resulting macrodispersivity tensor in terms of a three-dimensional, statistically anisotropic input covariance describing the hydraulic conductivity and an input covariance describing the temporal variability of the mean hydraulic gradient.  The flow equation was approximated by neglecting the influence of internal storage due to medium and fluid compressibility (specific storage, S(s) almost-equal-to 0).  The predictive expression for the macrodispersivity tensor is the sum of two components:  a spatial variability component identical to previous steady state theory and an unsteady component.  Two special cases of unsteady flow were examined:  variation only in the magnitude and variation only in the direction of the hydraulic gradient.  Gradient magnitude variation produces a slightly larger longitudinal macrodispersivity than does the steady flow case, whereas gradient direction variation produces a significantly larger transverse macrodispersivity.  Longitudinal and horizontal transverse macrodispersivities predicted with the unsteady stochastic theory were shown to be of a magnitude similar to observed values from the Borden, Cape Cod, and Columbus tracer experiments.

AB One of the most important problems of hydrological forecasting is to obtain a reliable estimation of effective rain.  Infiltration is one of the variables which greatly influences the partitioning of rainfall into surface runoff and subsurface flow.  This paper presents an infiltration model which describes the unsaturated zone as a multi-layer system.  For this purpose a relationship developed by Denisov (1978) for total hydraulic potential versus soil moisture content has been used.  The model contains a system of ordinary differential equations for describing soil moisture movement and it can be interpreted as an aggregated simulation model with lumped parameters.  Some basic equations and results of simulation runs are presented.

AB The Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) radiometer is a useful tool for monitoring snow wetness on a large scare because water content has a significant effect on the microwave emissions at the snowpack surface. To date, SSM/I snow wetness algorithms, based on statistical regression analysis, have been developed only for specific regions. Inadequate ground-based snow wetness measurements and the non-linearity between SSM/I brightness temperatures (T(B)s) and snow wetness over varied vegetation covered terrain has impeded the development of a general model. In this study, we used a previously developed linear relationship between snowpack surface wetness (% by volume) and concurrent air temperature (degrees C) to estimate the snow wetness at ground weather stations. The snow condition (snow free, dry, wet or refrozen snow) of each SSM/I pixel (a 37 x 29 km area at 37.0 GHz) was determined from ground-measured weather data and the T-B signature. SSM/I T(B)s of wet snow were then linked with the snow wetness estimates as an input/output relationship. A single-hidden-layer back-propagation (backprop) artificial neural network (ANN) was designed to learn the relationships. After training, the snow wetness values estimated by the ANN were compared with those derived by regression models. Results show that the ANN performed better than the existing regression models in estimating snow wetness from SSM/I data over terrain with different amounts of vegetation cover.

AB We present an efficient numerical method for solving stochastic porous media flow problems. Single-phase flow with a random conductivity field is considered in a standard first-order perturbation expansion framework. The numerical scheme, based on finite element techniques, is computationally more efficient than traditional approaches because one can work with a much coarser finite element mesh. This is achieved by avoiding the common finite element representation of the conductivity field. Computations with the random conductivity field only arise in integrals of the log conductivity covariance function. The method is demonstrated in several two- and three-dimensional flow situations and compared to analytical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations. Provided that the integrals involving the covariance of the log conductivity are computed by higher-order Gaussian quadrature rules, excellent results can be obtained with characteristic element sizes equal to about five correlation lengths of the log conductivity field. Investigations of the Validity of the proposed first-order method are performed by comparing nonlinear Monte Carlo results with linear solutions. In box-shaped domains the log conductivity standard deviation oy may be as large as 1.5, while the head variance is considerably influenced by nonlinear effects as ay approaches unity in more general domains.

AB The spatio-temporal distribution of snow in a catchment during ablation reflects changes in the total amount of snow water equivalent and is thus a key parameter for the estimation of melt water run-off. This study explores possible rules behind the spatial variability of snow depth during the ablation season in a small Alpine catchment with complex topography. The snow depth observations are based on more than 160?000 terrestrial laser scanner data points with a spatial resolution of 1?m, which were obtained from 11 scanning campaigns of two consecutive ablation seasons. The analysis suggests that for estimating cumulative snow melt dynamics from the catchment investigated, assessing the initial snow distribution prior to the melt season is more important than addressing spatial differences in the melt behaviour. Snow volume and snow-covered area could be predicted well using a conceptual melt model assuming spatially uniform melt rates. However, accurate results were only obtained if the model was initialized with a pre-melt snow distribution that reflected measured mean and standard deviation. Using stratified melt rates on the other hand did not improve the model results. At least for sites with similar meteorological and topographical conditions, the model approach presented here comprises an efficient way to estimate snow depletion dynamics, especially if persistent snow accumulation pattern between years facilitate the characterization of the initial snow distribution prior to the melt.

AB Mandelbrot's (1982) hypothesis that river length is fractal has been recently substantiated by Hjelmfelt (1988) using eight rivers in Missouri.  The fractal dimension of river length, d, is derived here from the Horton's laws of network composition.  This results in a simple function of stream length and stream area ratios, that is, d = max (1, 2 log R(L)/log R(A).  Three case studies are reported showing this estimate to be coherent with measurements of d obtained from map analysis.  The scaling properties of the network as a whole are also investigated, showing the fractal dimension of river network, D, to depend upon bifurcation and stream area ratios according to D = min (2, 2 log R(B)/log R(A)).  These results provide a linkage between quantitative analysis of drainage network composition and scaling properties of river networks.

TI Identifying rainfall-runoff events in discharge time series: a
   data-driven method based on information theory
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID ENTROPY; UNCERTAINTY; SEPARATION; AMPLITUDE
AB In this study, we propose a data-driven approach for automatically identifying rainfall-runoff events in discharge time series. The core of the concept is to construct and apply discrete multivariate probability distributions to obtain probabilistic predictions of each time step that is part of an event. The approach permits any data to serve as predictors, and it is non-parametric in the sense that it can handle any kind of relation between the predictor(s) and the target. Each choice of a particular predictor data set is equivalent to formulating a model hypothesis. Among competing models, the best is found by comparing their predictive power in a training data set with user-classified events. For evaluation, we use measures from information theory such as Shannon entropy and conditional entropy to select the best predictors and models and, additionally, measure the risk of overfitting via cross entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence. As all these measures are expressed in "bit", we can combine them to identify models with the best tradeoff between predictive power and robustness given the available data.
   We applied the method to data from the Dornbirner Ach catchment in Austria, distinguishing three different model types: models relying on discharge data, models using both discharge and precipitation data, and recursive models, i. e., models using their own predictions of a previous time step as an additional predictor. In the case study, the additional use of precipitation reduced predictive uncertainty only by a small amount, likely because the information provided by precipitation is already contained in the discharge data. More generally, we found that the robustness of a model quickly dropped with the increase in the number of predictors used (an effect well known as the curse of dimensionality) such that, in the end, the best model was a recursive one applying four predictors (three standard and one recursive): dis-charge from two distinct time steps, the relative magnitude of discharge compared with all discharge values in a surrounding 65 h time window and event predictions from the previous time step. Applying the model reduced the uncertainty in event classification by 77.8 %, decreasing conditional entropy from 0.516 to 0.114 bits. To assess the quality of the proposed method, its results were binarized and validated through a holdout method and then compared to a physically based approach. The comparison showed similar behavior of both models (both with accuracy near 90 %), and the crossvalidation reinforced the quality of the proposed model.
   Given enough data to build data-driven models, their potential lies in the way they learn and exploit relations between data unconstrained by functional or parametric assumptions and choices. And, beyond that, the use of these models to reproduce a hydrologist's way of identifying rainfall-runoff events is just one of many potential applications.

TI Significance of porosity variability to transport in heterogeneous

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; RANDOM-FIELDS; CONDUCTIVITY; SORPTION
AB We use Monte Carlo simulations of flow and transport in two-dimensional random conductivity, porosity, and geochemistry fields to explore the influence of their spatial variability on flow and transport processes for both conservative and reactive chemicals. For conservative transport, results show that when the porosity is correlated to the hydraulic conductivity (which may be expected in geologic formations); the dispersion process is significantly affected. Positive cross correlation between the porosity and the conductivity decreases dispersion, while a negative correlation tends to increase dispersion in the longitudinal direction. For reactive transport in physically and chemically heterogeneous media, the geochemical variability alone yields results that are significantly different than when both geochemistry and porosity are random space variables correlated to the conductivity field. These results suggest that it is necessary to examine the role porosity variability and its correlation to the conductivity play in transport theories. The stochastic perturbation transport theory, previously developed by our group for conservative chemicals, is modified to account for the porosity variability and its correlation with the hydraulic conductivity. The results of the modified theory support the Monte Carlo simulations and indicate that porosity variability significantly affects the second longitudinal moment. The implication of the study for field problems depends on the existence of cross correlation between porosity and conductivity.

ID WATER-SUPPLY OPERATIONS; HEDGING RULE; OPTIMIZATION; RELIABILITY;
   DROUGHT
AB This paper discusses the optimality conditions for standard operation policy (SOP) and hedging rule (HR) for a two-stage reservoir operation problem using a consistent theoretical framework. The effects of three typical constraints, i.e., mass balance, nonnegative release, and storage constraints under both certain and uncertain conditions are analyzed. When all nonnegative constraints and storage constraints are unbinding, HR results in optimal reservoir operation following the marginal benefit (MB) principle (the MB is equal over current and future stages. However, if any of those constraints are binding, SOP results in the optimal solution, except in some special cases which need to carry over water in the current stage to the future stage, when extreme drought is certain and a higher marginal utility exists for the second stage. Furthermore, uncertainty complicates the effects of the various constraints. A higher uncertainty level in the future makes HR more favorable as water needs to be reserved to defend against the risk caused by uncertainty. Using the derived optimality conditions, an algorithm for solving a numerical model is developed and tested with the Miyun Reservoir in China.

AB Flow regulation between irrigation storages and demand offtakes often results in prolonged elevated flows in the river channel during a period that would otherwise typically experience lower flows. This is a growing concern worldwide with negative implications for aquatic flora and fauna susceptible to changes in the hydraulic environment. Slackwaters, a hydraulic patch characterized by low velocities and shallow depths, are important habitat for zooplankton and have been associated with an order of magnitude more fish and shrimp than midchannel patches. Slackwaters are vulnerable to flow regulation and reductions in slackwater area have been shown to reduce abundances of juvenile and larval fish with poor swimming abilities; invertebrates dependent on slackwater refugia; and organic matter retention. It is therefore surprising that the relationship between flow regulation and slackwaters has not been explicitly quantified. In this study, we quantify changes to slackwaters (by surface area relative to inundated area) under the influence of flow regulation, specifically total area, patch area, and number of patches. Using two-dimensional hydraulic modeling for sites on the Broken River, southeastern Australia, we demonstrate that the area of slackwaters decreases with increasing discharge until inundation of higher-elevation bars and benches. We assess changes in slackwaters against three levels of increasing flow regulation intensity and find that increasing levels of regulation reduce slackwater area: With a heavily regulated scenario resulting in half the slackwater area and patch sizes 5 times smaller, compared with natural conditions. These findings provide the conceptual model and quantifiable relationships for testing population dynamics, identifying key hydrologic drivers of ecological decline and assisting river storage operators to manage flows during critical periods for biota.

AB A perturbation model of water movement in heterogeneous soils is presented, emphasizing its theoretical features.  It is based on the fundamental physical concepts of continuity and Darcy's law which hold in saturated and in unsaturated zones.  Soil heterogeneity may be represented by an arbitrary number of spatially varying stochastic parameters.  The derivation of the model equations leads to a system of functional differential equations which describes the average behaviour of a flow process and predicts its stochastic variability.  This system will be reduced to the familiar Richards equation, if the soil parameters are assumed to be known deterministically.  For the general stochastic case it is shown how the deterministic concept of volume conservation is transferred to the conservation of the corresponding distribution moments.  Suitable initial and boundary conditions are formulated for means and covariances of hydraulic head and flux.  Finally, the range of applicability of the new flow model is discussed.

AB In this paper we analyze a model for brine transport in porous media, which includes a mass balance for the fluid, a mass balance for salt, Darcy's law and an equation of state, which relates the fluid density to the salt mass fraction. This model incorporates the effect of local volume changes due to variations in the salt concentration. Density variations affect the compressibility of the fluid, which in turn cause additional fluid Bow. Two specific situations are investigated that lead to self-similarity. We study the relative importance of the compressibility effect in terms of the relative density difference. Semi-analytical solutions are obtained as well as asymptotic expressions in terms of the relative density difference. It is found that the volume changes have a small but noticeable effect on the mass transport only when the salt concentration gradients are large. Some results on the simultaneous transport of brine and dissolved (radioactive) tracers are presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.

AB In coarse porous media, Darcy's law is not valid because of turbulence. Different alternative laws have been proposed like Forchheimer's or Izbash's law. In the present study, these two laws were experimentally investigated and have been shown to be equally suitable to describe the flow equation in different coarse materials, namely gravel materials and geosynthetic products. Izbash's law (nu(n) = -lambda(n)i) has been preferred to derive drainage equations because it is in continuity with Darcy's law and facilitates the development of an analytical solution. It has been introduced in Boussinesq's equation, which has been solved by a semi-analytical semi-numerical method. General equations for the drainage of coarse porous media have been derived and incorporated into the drainage model SIDRA, which predicts water-table elevations and drain flow rates for a given net recharge. This allows for comparison (i) between predicted Darcian and non-Darcian behaviours and (ii) between predicted drainage functionings of different coarse materials. Plater-table elevations are shown to be much more sensitive to non-Darcian flow equation and to the hydraulic properties of the materials than drain flow rates. Response surface maps of an objective function based on the Nash criterion show that the water-table predictions are almost not sensitive to drainable porosity values. They also indicate that the two parameters of the Izbash flow equation (lambda and n) are dependent for water-table prediction. Based on this result a method is proposed to determine hydraulic properties and drainage systems yielding similar water-table elevations. The results can help choosing between classical granular materials and grocomposite products in drainage systems such as leachate collection systems of landfills. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Streamflow recession has been investigated by a variety of methods, often involving the fit of a model to empirical recession plots to parameterize a non-linear storage-outflow relationship based on the dQ/dt-Q method. Such recession analysis methods (RAMs) are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity, storage capacity, or aquifer thickness and to model streamflow recession curves for regionalization and prediction at the catchment scale. Numerous RAMs have been published, but little is known about how comparably the resulting recession models distinguish characteristic catchment behavior. In this study we combined three established recession extraction methods with three different parameter-fitting methods to the power-law storage-outflow model to compare the range of recession characteristics that result from the application of these different RAMs. Resulting recession characteristics including recession time and corresponding storage depletion were evaluated for 20 mesoscale catchments in Germany. We found plausible ranges for model parameterization; however, calculated recession characteristics varied over two orders of magnitude. While recession characteristics of the 20 catchments derived with the different methods correlate strongly, particularly for the RAMs that use the same extraction method, not all rank the catchments consistently, and the differences among some of the methods are larger than among the catchments. To elucidate this variability we discuss the ambiguous roles of recession extraction procedures and the parameterization of the storage-outflow model and the limitations of the presented recession plots. The results suggest strong limitations to the comparability of recession characteristics derived with different methods, not only in the model parameters but also in the relative characterization of different catchments. A multiple-methods approach to investigating streamflow recession characteristics should be considered for applications whenever possible.

AB This study explores the potential for predicting the spatial variation in subsurface water level change with crop growth stage from satellite data in Thabua Irrigation Project, situated in the northern central region of Thailand. The relationship between subsurface water level change from pumping water to irrigate rice in the dry season and the age of the rice was analysed. The spatial model of subsurface water level change was developed from the classification using greenness or (normalized difference vegetation index NDVI) derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper data. The NDVI of 52 rice fields was employed to assess its relationship to the age of the rice. It was found that NDVI and rice age have a good correlation (R-2 = 0(.)73). The low NDVI values (-0(.)059 to 0(.)082) in these fields were related to the young rice stage (0(.)30 days). NDVI and subsurface water level change were also correlated in this study and found to have a high correlation (Water level change (m day(-1)) = 0(.)3442 x NDVI - 0(.)0372; R-2 = 0(.)96). From this model, the water level change caused by rice at different growth stages was derived. This was used to show the spatial variation of water level change in the project during the 1998-99 dry-season cropping. This simple method of using NDVI relationships with water level change and crop growth stages proves to be useful in determining the areas prone to excessive lowering of the subsurface water level during the dry season. This could assist in the appropriate planning of the use of subsurface water resources in dry-season cropping. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Many models for soil water retention have been proposed.  However, most of these models are curve-fitting equations and do not emphasize the physical significance of their empirical parameters.  A new retention model that exhibits increased flexibility was developed by applying three-parameter lognormal distribution laws to the pore radius distribution function f(r) and to the water capacity function, which was taken to be the pore capillary pressure distribution function f(psi).  This model contains three parameters that are closely related to the statistics of f(psi):  the bubbling pressure psi(c), the mode psi0 of f(psi), and the standard deviation sigma of transformed f(psi).  By comparison of this model with three existing models (the van Genuchten model, the Brooks-Corey model, and the modified Tani model), it was shown that psi(c), psi0, and sigma are all essential for a general retention model.

AB Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is an electromagnetic technique for measurements of water and solute transport in soils. The relationship between the TDR-measured dielectric constant (K-a) and bulk soil electrical conductivity (sigma (a)) to water content (theta (w)) and solute concentration is difficult to describe physically due to the complex dielectric response of wet soil. This has led to the development of mostly empirical calibration models. In the present study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are utilized for calculations of theta (w) and soil solution electrical conductivity (sigma (w)) from TDR-measured K-a and sigma (a) in sand. The ANN model performance is compared to other existing models. The results show that the ANN performs consistently better than all other models, suggesting the suitability of ANNs for accurate TDR calibrations.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY
AB The flow of water through a porous medium is simulated numerically using a cubic network of cylindrical capillary tubes as the conceptual model of the medium. Poiseuille's law is used to relate the viscous dissipation within the fluid to the pressure gradient driving the flow. The pore size distribution is determined from the capillary pressure function of the medium, and the tubes are randomly arranged within the network. A critical pore radius is identified as the limiting pore size which contributes to the permeability structure of the medium. When only tubes from that part of the pore size distribution above this critical radius are used to form the network, the permeability of the network equals the measured permeability of the medium. This parameter, the critical pore radius, links the permeability to the pore size distribution and gives insight into the topological structure of the medium.

AB [1] An overview of the annual hydroclimatology of the United States is provided. Time series of monthly streamflow, temperature, and precipitation are developed for 1337 watersheds in the United States. This unique data set is then used to evaluate several approaches for estimating the long-term water balance and the interannual variability of streamflow. Traditional relationships which predict either actual evapotranspiration or the interannual variability of streamflow from an aridity index phi = (PE) over bar/(P) over bar are shown to perform poorly for basins with low soil moisture storage capacity. A water balance model is used to formulate new relationships for predicting actual evapotranspiration and the interannual variability of streamflow. These relationships depend on both the aridity index phi = (PE) over bar/(P) over bar and a new soil moisture storage index. A physically based approach for estimating the soil moisture storage index is introduced which requires monthly time series of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and an estimate of maximum soil moisture holding capacity. The net results are improved expressions for the long-term water balance and the interannual variability of streamflow which do not require either calibration or streamflow data.

AB Transient water table systems under the influence of decaying groundwater mounds are studied in terms of the Dupuit-Forcheimer approximation, its linearization and linear potential theory. Parabolic mounds spreading and shrinking due to gravity and evapotranspiration are derived from the general class defined by Polubarinova-Kochina (1945). The penetration curves are calculated as characteristics of the water table response at prescribed observation wells. The Polubarinova-Kochina solutions for rectangular mounds are used to derive isochrones, a ''resting lens'' into which a mound transforms, and a distortion picture of reference volumes. These characteristics are obtained from numerical solution of a system of ordinary differential equation. The plume illustrating the advective spread of a contaminant from a reference area is computed as a composition of all path lines passing through this area.

AB A simple conceptual model of saturation excess runoff generation, the Hydrogeomorphic Steady State model (HGSS) is developed using widely observed geomorphic relationships: the saturation excess threshold, the area-slope relationship, and the cumulative area diagram. HGSS provides theoretical insight into the link between runoff generation by saturation excess and the geomorphology that governs it. Current models for saturation excess runoff generation require detailed analysis of catchment digital elevation maps (DEMs), and their prediction accuracy depends on the DEM grid resolution and the analysis techniques used on the DEM data. HGSS can predict the saturated area at steady state without site-specific DEM analysis. In its simplest form, HGSS requires only two parameters, each a combination of geomorphology parameters, together with soil and recharge properties. Effectively, HGSS predicts an antecedent recharge-dependent runoff coefficient. A scaling solution indicates that the percentage of the catchment saturated decreases with the square root of catchment area over a broad range of catchment areas and that the proportion of the catchment saturated has a log-log linear relationship with recharge. HGSS is tested by comparing its predictions with two DEM rainfall-runoff models, the steady state TOPMODEL and a kinematic wave saturation excess model DISTFW-EXT, with HGSS predictions matching for steady state conditions.

AB The detention storage in a drainage basin under the equilibrium condition is an important parameter in rainfall-runoff modelling. As this parameter is an efficient measure of the basin response to rainfall, it is commonly used as a basis of approximation of a complex basin by a simpler one. For flows on an overland plane, the equilibrium storage has also been used as a basis of determining the resistance coefficient of the overland surface. A formula is derived, based on the kinematic wave theory, for the equilibrium detention storage for a series of planes. For practical applications, the formula is further developed in terms of the Manning resistance coefficient. The derived formulae are all consistent with the published formulae for a single plane.

TI A new framework for resolving conflicts over transboundary rivers using

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID GAME-THEORETIC ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALLOCATION; STABILITY
AB A novel bankruptcy approach is proposed for resolving transboundary river conflicts in which the total water demand or claim of the riparian parties is more than the available water. Bankruptcy solution methods can allocate the available water to the conflicting parties with respect to their claims. Four commonly used bankruptcy methods in the economic literature are used here to develop new river bankruptcy solution methods for allocating water to the riparian parties of river systems. Given the non-uniform spatial and temporal distribution of water across river basins, the proposed solution methods are formulated as non-linear network flow optimization models to allocate water with respect to time sensitivity of water deliveries at different locations in a river network during the planning horizon. Once allocation optimization solutions are developed, their acceptability and stability must be evaluated. Thus, a new bankruptcy allocation stability index (BASI) is developed for evaluating the acceptability of river bankruptcy solutions. To show how the proposed river bankruptcy framework can be helpful in practice, the suggested methods are applied to a real-world transboundary river system with eight riparians under various hydrologic regimes. Stability analysis based on the proposed stability evaluation method suggests that the acceptability of allocation rules is sensitive to hydrologic conditions and demand values. This finding has an important policy implication suggesting that fixed allocation rules and treaties may not be reliable for securing cooperation over transboundary water resources as they are vulnerable to changing socioeconomic and climatic conditions as well as hydrologic non-stationarity.

AB Recently, an exact Eulerian-Lagrangian theory of advective transport in spacetime random velocity fields was developed by one of us. We present a formal extension of this theory that accounts for anisotropic local dispersion. The resultant (conditional) mean transport equation is generally nonlocal in space-time. To assess the impact of local dispersion on the prediction of transport under uncertainty, we adopt a first-order pseudo-Fickian approximation for this equation. We then solve it numerically by Galerkin finite elements for two-dimensional transport from an instantaneous square source in a uniform (unconditional) mean flow field subject to isotropic local dispersion. We use a higher-order approximation to compute explicitly the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the predicted concentrations. Our theory shows (in an exact manner), and our numerical results demonstrate (under the above closure approximations), that the effect of local dispersion on first and second concentration moments varies monotonically with the magnitude of the local dispersion coefficient. When this coefficient is small relative to macrodispersion, its effect on the prediction of nonreactive transport under uncertainty can, for all practical purposes, be disregarded. This is contrary to some recent assertions in the literature that local dispersion must always be taken into account, no matter how small.

AB A 9-year sediment transport monitoring programme on the Niger River was used to Study the relationship between suspended sediment concentration and river discharge. During annual floods, this relationship shows the hysteresis normally observed on tropical rivers. This paper presents an attempt to model the time evolution of suspended sediment concentrations during floods using only water discharge data. Two models have been developed. The first model is an empirical model based oil a statistical approach using two relationships, one for the rising stage period and one for the recession period of the annual flood. The second one, a lumped conceptual model, uses the respective contributions of two sediment reservoirs. The first reservoir is limited in size and period of functioning and represents hillslope erosion observed during the runoff season. The second reservoir is unlimited in terms of both its size and period of operation and represents sediment contributions from bank erosion and remobilization of sediment deposits in the channel network. Both models have been applied to the Banankoro gauging station on the upper Niger River (for the hydrological years from 1991/1992 to 1999/2000) and are able to simulate the time evolution of sediment concentration during the annual cycle, with a reasonable degree of accuracy. For annual sediment yield, the models do not provide a better estimate than a simple regression with annual water volume. However, the two models are able to simulate the evolution of the sediment flux during the flood. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Flow at high Reynolds numbers through anisotropic porous media
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

DT Article
AB An approximate expression is developed for the relationship between the hydraulic gradient (J), the specific discharge (q) and fluid and porous matrix properties in the case of saturated, steady and uniform (macroscopic) flow of a Newtonian liquid at high Reynolds numbers through a homogeneous anisotropic porous medium:
   gJ = (vw((2)) + B-(4): qq/q + C-(3).q).q
   In this expression, the tensors w((2)), B-(4) and C-(3) denote properties of the solid matrix only. The tensors W-(2), and C-(3) are symmetrical; the tensor B-(4) is symmetrical only in the first and last pairs of indices. It seems that no mathematical expression with a finite number of parameters exists, which can serve as a universal exact expression for the sought relationship between J and q.

AB This paper studies the fractal structure and properties of stream networks through a comparison between stream network's and loopless random aggregate trees. Five fractal dimensions are recognized for stream networks, namely, topological dimension (d(t)), minimum path dimension (d(m)), fractal dimension of stream networks as a whole (d(f)). diffusion dimension (d(w)), and spectral dimension (d(s)). Mathematical definitions and derivations of the fractal dimensions are proposed, which provide a theoretical basis for some recognized empirical relationships in drainage basin geomorphology. Relationships among the fractal dimensions are examined, and the average values of the fractal dimensions for natural stream networks are estimated. The hydrological implications of the fractal dimensions of stream networks are also discussed.

TI Contribution of the multi-attribute value theory to conflict resolution

   groundwater system, Spain
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

AB The implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive demands participatory water resource management approaches. Decision making in groundwater quantity and quality management is complex because of the existence of many independent actors, heterogeneous stakeholder interests, multiple objectives, different potential policies, and uncertain outcomes. Conflicting stakeholder interests have often been identified as an impediment to the realisation and success of water regulations and policies. The management of complex groundwater systems requires the clarification of stakeholders' positions (identifying stakeholder preferences and values), improving transparency with respect to outcomes of alternatives, and moving the discussion from the selection of alternatives towards the definition of fundamental objectives (value-thinking approach), which facilitates negotiation. The aims of the study are to analyse the potential of the multi-attribute value theory for conflict resolution in groundwater management and to evaluate the benefit of stakeholder incorporation into the different stages of the planning process, to find an overall satisfying solution for groundwater management. The research was conducted in the Mancha Oriental groundwater system (Spain), subject to intensive use of groundwater for irrigation. A complex set of objectives and attributes was defined, and the management alternatives were created by a combination of different fundamental actions, considering different implementation stages and future changes in water resource availability. Interviews were conducted with representative stakeholder groups using an interactive platform, showing simultaneously the consequences of changes in preferences to the alternative ranking. Results show that the approval of alternatives depends strongly on the combination of measures and the implementation stages. Uncertainties in the results were notable, but did not influence the alternative ranking heavily. The expected reduction in future groundwater resources by climate change increases the conflict potential. The implementation of the method in a very complex case study, with many conflicting objectives and alternatives and uncertain outcomes, including future scenarios under water limiting conditions, illustrates the potential of the method for supporting management decisions.

AB Multiphase flow processes in fractured rocks are of major importance for the remediation of subsurface contamination, for engineering petroleum reservoirs, and for the safety analysis of nuclear waste repositories. We developed procedures for determining the water retention curve, gas permeability function, and pore structure of undisturbed fracture-zone samples with cohesionless fault gouge layers in the laboratory. Mylonitic samples were taken at Grimsel Test Site (Switzerland). Intrinsic permeabilities of the fault gouge layers were 5 orders of magnitude higher, and significant desaturation occurred at capillary pressure heads about 10 times lower than in the surrounding granodiorite, thus showing that at this site gas flow would take place mainly in the fracture zone. The measured water retention and gas permeability data were well represented by parametric models designed for porous media. Gas flow could only be detected at water saturations below about 0.8, thus showing strong phase interference at high water saturations. To relate these findings to the pore structure of the samples, a qualitative and quantitative description of the pore space was obtained at different scales using fluorescent resin imbibition and image analysis techniques. Results show that the fracture zone consists of a continuous and interconnected fracture network that is filled with a porous medium-like material, thus explaining the applicability of the above mentioned models and the rather strong phase interference.

AB Historically, the development of cooperation among Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan with respect to the Indus and the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basins, South Asia's major transboundary rivers, has been a cause of tension, apprehension and ongoing disputes. This paper draws attention to the hydro-politics on transference and allocation, along with the diverging positions and unique concerns of the riparians on bilateral, multilateral, national as well as regional fronts. While examining the official water discourses and the evolution of different international legal instruments applicable to the governance of water relations among the riparians, the paper also sketches the emerging concerns in their relationships, as well as their efforts to cooperate and collaborate to avert disputes and manage water sharing and governance.

AB A simple relationship to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity K(s) from the van Genuchten shape parameter a is presented. The derivation of the relationship is based on the assumption that the porosity of the soil can be represented by a group of parallel capillary tubes with a fractal cumulative size distribution of pores. The proposed expression of K(s)(alpha) reduces the number of independent van Genuchten parameters from five to four and permits determination of all model parameters directly from water content data, avoiding measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity. Estimated values of K(s) for major soil textural groups are in very good agreement with average values obtained by Carsel and Parrish (1988).

ID RICHARDS EQUATION; CONDUCTIVITY; M->INFINITY; TEXTURE; MODEL; FLOW; UM
AB Heavy clay soils are characterized by a strong power-law dependence of the soil water potential on the soil water content. Numerical solutions for water transport are difficult for such soils so that analytical solutions become crucial. Asymptotic solutions are derived for the sorption of water by an initially dry, heavy clay soil which are valid in the limit of large power-law exponent, as defined by the Campbell relation. The most general boundary condition considered is surface flux as a power-law function of time with arbitrary exponent. A new exact solution is also derived for the Richards equation which is valid for a particular time-dependence of the surface flux. It is shown that a previous asymptotic solution in another context is a special case of the solutions of this paper.

TI Frequency of record-breaking floods in the United States
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID HYDROLOGY; DIAGRAMS; TRENDS
AB The theory of record-breaking processes offers a framework for understanding extreme events which is nearly independent of the theory of extremes. The mathematical theory of record-breaking processes is applied to the problem of identifying nonstationarity in hydrological records. A record flood event is simply an event which exceeds all previous events. The probability distribution and first four moments of the number of record events in an n-year period, R, are derived for a serially independent process. The variance of estimates of the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation R is also derived. In addition, approximate confidence intervals are derived for the mean number of record-breaking events in a region with spatially correlated flood series. Using these results, in combination with 1571 flood records in the United States, we document that the average number of record breaking flood events over n-year periods ranging from [10, 80] behaved as if the annual flood series were seriary independent for all regions of the United States. However, when spatial correlation of the flood records is ignored, as is the case in many previous studies, it appears as if flood records are not serially independent in the western and Midwestern regions of the United States. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for the spatial correlation structure of hydrologic records when performing regional hypothesis tests.

ID SUBSURFACE STORM FLOW; HILLSLOPE; STREAMS
AB We study subsurface storm flow from a planar hill slope, a problem that is similar hydraulically to lateral flow toward drains in landfills. Our analysis is based on the linearized one-dimensional Boussinesq equation (Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation), which is extended to allow for leakage through the underlying barrier. This linear advection-diffusion equation has a greater range of validity than the kinematic wave equation. Stating it in terms of the discharge, the variable of primary hydrologic interest, we integrate it numerically, using an adaptation of the Muskingum-Cunge routing scheme. A single-step computation of the outflow hydrograph, which combines the convenience of an analytical solution formula with acceptable accuracy, is proposed as a design tool and as a means of parameterization of drainage from hill slopes. Depth profiles are determined afterwards by a simple integration of Darcy's law. Examples of the buildup and recession phases, with and without leakage, demonstrate the application of the computational method.

AB Twenty-nine Schlumberger electrical soundings were carried out in the Salamiyeh region in Syria using a maximum current electrode separation of I km. Three soundings were made at existing boreholes for comparison. Aquifer parameters of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity were obtained by analysing pumping test data from the existing boreholes. An empirical relationship between hydraulic conductivity determined from the pumping test and both resistivity and thickness of the Neogene aquifer has been established for these boreholes in order to calculate the geophysical hydraulic conductivity. A close agreement has been obtained between the computed hydraulic conductivity and that determined from the pumping test. The relationship established has, therefore, been generalized in the study area in order to evaluate hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity at all the points where geoelectrical measurements have been carried out. This generalization allows one to derive maps of the hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity in the study area based on geoelectrical measurements. These maps are important in future modelling processes oriented towards better exploitation of the aquifers. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Predicting two- and three-fluid capillary pressure saturation
   relationships of porous media with fractional wettability
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DRAINAGE
AB Knowledge of the capillary pressure-saturation (P-c-S) relations of porous media is essential for the research and management of multiphase flow and transport. Indirect methods have often been used to predict P-c-S curves, since the actual measurement of all P-c-S curves may be cumbersome. Existing methods to predict the P-c-S relations for porous media with fractional wettability, however, are generally inadequate. This paper reports on methods to quantify P-c-S curves of such media that contain two or three fluids (air, oil, and water). The prediction of oil-water P-c-S relations from air-oil or air-water P-c-S data through mere scaling is not possible since the oil-water capillary pressure may be positive or negative in fractional wettability media. We successfully predicted the oil-water P-c-S curve using a linear transformation of air-oil P-c-S data. In three-fluid media with fractional wettability the prediction of three-fluid from two-fluid P-c-S relations using only Leverett's assumption is unreliable, since both water and oil act as intermediate fluid. We predicted the three-fluid oil-water P-c from two-fluid oil-water or linearly transformed air-oil P-c-S data. The three-fluid air-oil P-c could be readily predicted from the two-fluid air-oil P-c-S relation for a variable oil saturation and a constant water saturation. In contrast, when the water saturation was varied, at a constant oil saturation, the air-oil P-c could only be predicted using an empirical correction for the two-fluid air-oil P-c-S data. The three-fluid air-water P-c is obtained as the sum of the oil-water P-c and the air-oil P-c (both water and oil pressures are measured with respect to atmospheric pressure).

AB One of the important problems in hydrology is the quantitative description of river system structure and the identification of relationships between geomorphological properties and hydrological response. Digital elevation models (DEMs) generally are used to delineate the basin's limits and to extract the channel network considering pixels draining an area greater than a threshold area S. In this paper, new catchment shape descriptors, the geometric characteristics of an equivalent ellipse that has the same centre of gravity, the same principal inertia axes, the same area and the same ratio of minimal inertia moment to maximal inertia moment as the basin, are proposed. They are applied in order to compare and classify the structure of seven basins located in southern France. These descriptors were correlated to hydrological properties of the basins' responses such as the lag time and the maximum amplitude of a geomorphological unit hydrograph calculated at the basin outlet by routing an impulse function through the channel network using the diffusive wave model. Then, we analysed the effects of the threshold area S on the topological structure of the channel network and on the evolution of the source catchment's shape. Simple models based on empirical relationships between the threshold S and the morphometric properties were established and new catchment shape indexes, independent of the observation scale S, were defined. This methodology is useful for geomorphologists dealing with the shape of source basins and for hydrologists dealing with the problem of scale effects on basin topology and on relationships between the basin morphometric properties and the hydrological response.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
AB The main contributors of high nitrate concentrations in the groundwater of the Vamsadhara River basin are the point sources associated with livestock barns while the seasonal variations in nitrate (NO3) concentrations are attributed to the prevailing hydrogeological conditions. The observed increase in nitrate under rising water level conditions, contradicting an expected decrease due to dilution by rainwater, is believed to be caused by the contribution of NO3 from the clayey soil. The processes of sorption, retention and slow denitrification in clay are probably responsible for the contribution of nitrate to the groundwater in the post-monsoon season. The positive linear relationship between chloride and nitrate is in agreement with the similarities in behaviour of these ions in the clayey formations.

AB [1] The hydraulics and morphology of secondary channels within the lower Fraser River gravel reach were examined using data collected with an acoustic Doppler profiler during the large 2002 freshet. Data were collected over an area of channel ("subreach''), for a range of subreach morphologies ("upstream,'' "mid,'' and "downstream''). As suggested by visual evidence, at-a-station hydraulic geometry of subreach types stratified along gradients of width, depth, and velocity. Fish habitat is more abundant and more persistently available in the wide, deep downstream subreaches, but higher velocities preferred by some species occur in the mid stream and upstream subreaches. Additional high-flow data, used to develop bank-full scaling relations ( classical "downstream'' hydraulic geometry), conformed well to a simple power law up to and including data points from the main channel. However, width and depth exponents deviated from classical results. Investigation suggests that the relations observed in this study approach expected relations for constant slope and channel boundary materials.

DT Article
AB Estimation of soil loss from single storm events is essential for basin planning and nonpoint source pollution control. Rainfall-runoff erosivity factors for single storm events in northern Iraq were derived from the basic theory of soil detachment and transport. The factors derived are a single parameter which includes runoff depth only and a factor which combines runoff depth and peak rate. These two erosivity factors gave satisfactory results when tested using data from natural runoff plots collected at different sites in the region. The same data were then used to test the applicability of various established erosivity factors. The two derived erosivity factors were superior to any known erosivity factor tested in the region. These include factors currently in use in Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) applications in different parts of the world.

ID IMPACTS
AB Water allocation occurs within systems that include market-driven and nonmarket approaches; these are often nested within complex collections of laws, contracts, and customs, and embody cultural definitions of the nature of water as a commodity or a right and the nature of fair exchanges. Understanding the dynamics of such an allocation system, including the ways that it may change through time and the ways that it can be modified to better achieve societal goals, can be challenging. One promising approach is agent-based modeling (ABM), and specifically models in which the agents dynamically adapt to the system that they create. The potential for such modeling in the domain of water systems is only beginning to be explored. We present a highly abstract but illustrative example of an adaptive system and its analysis to show the potential for the ABM approach.

ID HIGHLY PERMEABLE AQUIFERS; SLUG TESTS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; MODEL
AB When a slug test is conducted in a highly permeable aquifer, a shallow pressure transducer in the well casing produces an oscillatory pressure head that is representative of the water level fluctuation, whereas a deep pressure transducer in the well casing yields an oscillatory pressure head that is different from the water level change. Although the solutions for shallow and deep pressure head are different, it is found that the ratios of the subsequent extremity displacements are in an identical relationship (an extremity can be a maximum or a minimum in the oscillatory pressure head). Based on this relationship, an analytical data analysis method for the determination of the hydraulic conductivity is developed for both shallow and deep pressure transducer data. This analytical method is applied to the pressure head measured at different depths in the well casing of a well partially penetrating an unconfined coarse sand aquifer. Satisfactory results are obtained, validating the applicability of this analytical method for pressure transducer data at any depth in a well casing. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB While the implementation of drinking water security legislation was an important response to a water quality tragedy in Ontario, Canada, its effect has been circumscribed by hydrosocial relations underlying water governance arrangements. The long-established land-use planningand more recent growth planning and place-based planninglaws and policies make water management secondary to land whether it is as part of the ecological system, as a resource, or as an amenity. The effect is to subjugate source water protection to land use and, indeed, economic development priorities for resource extraction. The Ontario case shows that implementation of proactive drinking water security through source protection law and policy will be circumscribed by hydrosocial relations that prioritize the economic development. To implement proactive drinking water security will require a fundamental rethinking of the trade-offs implicit in our existing hydrosocial relations.

AB A resistivity survey is conducted in Khanasser Valley, a semi-arid region in northern Syria, to delineate the characteristics of ground water affected by the salt-water intrusion related to Al-Jaboul Sabkha. Existing wells were used to measure salinity and conductivity of water samplings. Vertical electrical sounding was carried out near the existing wells. The combination of resistivity and hydrogeological data enables the establishment of empirical relationships between earth resistivity, water resistivity, and the amount of total dissolved solids. These relationships are then used in order to derive salinity maps for electrode spacings of 70, 100, and 150 m. The distribution of fresh, brackish and salt-water zones and their variations in space along two longitudinal profiles (LP1 and LP2) are established through converting subsurface depth-resistivity models into different ground-water areas. The constructed ground-water area maps allow interfaces between different water zones to be determined. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI SIMULATING THE VOLATILIZATION OF SOLVENTS IN UNSATURATED SOILS DURING

AB This paper describes laboratory and field experiments which were conducted to study the dynamics of trichloroethylene (TCE) as it volatilized from contaminated groundwater and diffused in the presence of infiltrating water through the unsaturated soil zone to the land surface. The field experiments were conducted at the Picatinny Arsenal, which is part of the United States Geological Survey Toxic Substances Hydrology Program. In both laboratory and field settings the gas and water phase concentrations of TCE were not in equilibrium during infiltration. Gas-water mass transfer rate constants were calibrated to the experimental data using a model in which the water phase was treated as two phases: a mobile water phase and an immobile water phase. The mass transfer limitations of a volatile organic compound between the gas and liquid phases were described explicitly in the model. In the laboratory experiment the porous medium was nonsorbing, and water infiltration rates ranged from 0.076 to 0.28 cm h-1. In the field experiment the water infiltration rate was 0.34 cm h-1, and sorption onto the soil matrix was significant. The laboratory-calibrated gas-water mass transfer rate constant is 3.3 x 10(-4) h-1 for an infiltration rate of 0.076 cm h-1 and 1.4 x 10(-3) h-1 for an infiltration rate of 0.28 cm h-1. The overall mass transfer rate coefficients, incorporating the contribution of mass transfer between mobile and immobile water phases and the variation of interfacial area with moisture content, range from 3 x 10(-4) h-1 to 1 x 10(-2) h-1. A power law model relates the gas-water mass transfer rate constant to the infiltration rate and the fraction of the water phase which is mobile. It was found that the results from the laboratory experiments could not be extrapolated to the field. In order to simulate the field experiment the very slow desorption of TCE from the soil matrix was incorporated into the mathematical model. When desorption from the soil matrix was added to the model, the calibrated gas-water mass transfer rate constant is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that predicted using the power law model developed for the nonsorbing laboratory soil.

AB Flow of non-Newtonian fluids between rough walls is of interest in several geophysical and industrial applications. In this work (mainly geared toward fractured media) a governing equation for creeping flow of a purely viscous power law fluid of flow behavior index n in a rough-walled fracture is obtained, generalizing past results for a Newtonian fluid. An equivalent fracture aperture is defined, in analogy to the well-known hydraulic aperture valid for n = 1. Tortuosity is introduced as a vectorial quantity, thereby distinguishing between true and apparent fracture aperture. Examples are provided to illustrate the utility of the proposed approach. It is demonstrated that tortuosity effects significantly decrease the equivalent fracture permeability. Depending on the specific geometry considered, the flow behavior index may or may not have a significant impact on the equivalent fracture permeability. When it does, the reduction effect due to tortuosity is enhanced as the flow behavior index decreases.

AB When a scale-dependent fractal dispersivity is introduced in the convective-dispersive equation of transport in subsurface flow, the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE), also known as the second diffusion equation, is derived. Similarity solutions of the one-dimensional FPE, subject to a Dirac delta function input, are also presented. The similarity solution is shown to function as a kernel in the convolution integral to yield an output on a real timescale. The input function is derived by a procedure known as the inverse problem with the aid of Laplace transform. The FPE and its solutions contain a fractal dimension D and cutoff limit epsilon, two shape parameters beta and gamma in the FPE, and other parameters that appear in Darcy's law. A two-dimensional FPE and its solutions have been presented elsewhere. It is reasoned that the scale-dependent dispersion in unsaturated flow is also an issue for investigation.

AB A characteristic feature of rainfall statistics is that they depend on the space and time scales over which rain data are averaged. A previously developed spectral model of rain statistics that is designed to capture this property predicts power law scaling behavior for the second moment statistics of area-averaged rain rate on the averaging length scale L as L --> 0. In the present work a more efficient method of estimating the model parameters is presented and used to fit the model to the statistics of area-averaged rain rate derived from gridded radar precipitation data from TOGA-COARE. Statistical properties of the data and the model predictions are compared over a wide range of averaging scales. An extension of the spectral model scaling relations to describe the dependence of the average fraction of grid boxes within an area containing nonzero rain (the "`rainy area fraction") on the grid scale L is also explored.

AB Old water contribution to streamflow is studied by the means of a simple groundwater model. The principal aim is not to develop a tool for applications but rather to understand some of the dynamics of old and new water after a rainfall event by using a simple model with a minimum set of variables. Event water is traced by solute transport analysis. Adopting a simple rainfall pulse of finite duration, the method identifies two key dimensionless parameters ruling the old water contribution to streamflow: a dimensionless rainfall time delta, ratio between the rain duration and the characteristic response time of the aquifer, and the ratio rho between rainfall volume and the water volume present in the aquifer at the beginning of rainfall. It was found that the rho parameter is crucial in the old water contribution to a rainfall event; less so are the temporal dynamics of rainfall, expressed through delta. For typical values of rho it is expected that old water contributes more than 50% of the total streamflow. These findings suggest that the groundwater dynamics may have a strong influence on the way that the hillslope responds to the rainfall input, and hence the partition between new (precipitation) and old (pre-event) waters.

TI FAT FRACTAL SCALING OF DRAINAGE NETWORKS FROM A RANDOM SPATIAL NETWORK
   MODEL
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DIMENSION
AB An alternative quantification of the scaling properties of river channel networks is explored using a spatial network model.  Whereas scaling descriptions of drainage networks previously have been presented using a fractal analysis primarily of the channel lengths, we illustrate the scaling of the surface area of the channels defining the network pattern with an exponent which is independent of the fractal dimension but not of the fractal nature of the network.  The methodology presented is a fat fractal analysis in which the drainage basin minus the channel area is considered the fat fractal.  Random channel networks within a fixed basin area are generated on grids of different scales.  The sample channel networks generated by the model have a common outlet of fixed width and a rule of upstream channel narrowing specified by a diameter branching exponent using hydraulic and geomorphologic principles.  Scaling exponents are computed for each sample network on a given grid size and are regressed against network magnitude.  Results indicate that the size of the exponents are related to magnitude of the networks and generally decrease as network magnitude increases.  Cases showing differences in scaling exponents with like magnitudes suggest a direction of future work regarding other topologic basin characteristics as potential explanatory variables.

AB This paper analyses the significance of the entropy concept in the topography parameterization within the model TOPMODEL proposed by Beven and Kirkby (1979), by means of the hydrological behaviour of an experimental basin in southern Italy. For a significant number of flood events recorded at the basin outlet, the performance of TOPMODEL for different spatial distributions of the topographic index, 1n(a/tan beta), has been observed. Performance is related to the information content estimated as an entropy measure, corresponding to each of the spatial distributions of the topographic index, with the aim of identifying the procedures most suitable to represent the hydrological process of rainfall-runoff.
   The results obtained have shown that for flood events corresponding to brief, heavy precipitation, some procedures provide better performances than others. Moreover, these improvements are justified by greater information content in the corresponding spatial distributions of the topographic index.
   Finally, TOPMODEL performances for some procedures have been analysed, varying the resolution scale of the topographic index. For analogous hydrological performances, scale change produced variations in some of the subsurface hydraulic parameters. These variations were proportional to a spatial variability measure of the topographic index distribution, derived from the corresponding information content. (C) 1997 by John Wiley Br Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper addresses the question of how spatial variability in the hydraulic and chemical properties of groundwater systems affects the transport and sorption behavior of pollutants at the field scale. In this paper, we limit our investigations on pollutants that adsorb according to an equilibrium controlled non-linear Freundlich sorption isotherm. The new contribution of this paper is take into account not only spatially variable Freundlich distribution coefficients K(s) but spatially variable Freundlich nonlinearity parameters p as well. Using a homogenization theory approach, we shortly review the impact of spatially variable hydraulic properties on the transport and extend the theory to spatially variable chemical properties. We show that spatially variable Freundlich exponents cause a very different field scale transport and sorption behavior than spatial variations in the distribution coefficients only since in the first case field scale Freundlich parameters and field scale dispersion coefficients become concentration dependent. In particular, field scale retardation is much larger than small-scale retardation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The soil water retention model developed by Kosugi was modified to be compatible with Mualem's model in order to derive an analytical expression for the relative hydraulic conductivity K-r. The modified water retention model is to be derived by applying a lognormal distribution law to the soil pore radius distribution function. Parameters of this retention model have physical significance on the water content (theta)-capillary pressure (psi) curve and are related directly to the statistics of the pore radius distribution. The accuracy of the resulting combined water-retention-hydraulic-conductivity model is verified for observed data sets for six soils. Results showed that the proposed model produces acceptable matches with observed water retention curves and adequate predictions of hydraulic conductivities in five out of six cases. The theta - psi and K-r - psi (or K-r - theta) curves generated by this model are generally similar to those generated by van Genuchten's model.

AB In the central part of the Bolivian Altiplano, the shallow groundwater presents electrical conductivities ranging from 0.1 to 20 mS/cm. In order to study the origin of this salinity pattern, a good knowledge is required of the geometry of the aquifer at depth. In this study, geophysics has been used to complement the sparse data available from drill holes. One hundred time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) soundings were carried out over an area of 1750 km(2). About 20 geological logs were available close to some of the TDEM soundings. Three intermediate results were obtained from the combined data: (i) the relationship between the electrical conductivity of the groundwater and the formation resistivity, (ii) geoelectrical cross-sections and (iii) geoelectrical maps at various depths. The limited data set shows a relationship between resistivity and the nature of the rock. From the cross-sections, a conductive substratum with a resistivity of less than 1 Omega (.)m was identified at most of the sites at depths ranging from 50 to 350 m. This substratum could be a clay-rich formation containing brines. Using derived relationships, maps of the nature of the formation (sandy, intermediate and clayey sediments) were established at depths of 10 and 50 m. Discrimination between sand and clays was impossible where groundwater conductivity is high (>3 mS/cm). In the central part of the area, where the groundwater conductivity is low, sandy sediments are likely to be present from the surface to a depth of more than 200 m. Clayey sediments are more likely to be present in the south-east and probably constitute a hydraulic barrier to groundwater flow. In conclusion, the study demonstrates the efficiency of the TDEM sounding method to map conductive zones. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI A DAILY HYDROCLIMATOLOGICAL DATA SET FOR THE CONTINENTAL UNITED-STATES
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID VARIABILITY
AB Previous attempts to validate general circulation model simulations of land surface hydrology have often been limited by the absence of systematic historical data, especially for runoff, precipitation, and temperature.  Because hydrological response times for unregulated watersheds in the United States vary from a few hours to a few days at most, climatological studies dealing with land surface hydrology require data at relatively short time intervals.  We describe a set of 1009 U.S. Geological Survey streamflow stations, and 1036 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climatological stations, for which long-term (1948-1988) observations have been assembled into a consistent daily data base with missing observations estimated using a simple closest-station prorating rule.  Care was taken in selection of the streamflow stations to assure that the records were essentially free from regulation.  The climatological stations are a subset of the historical climatology network for which monthly data are described by Quinlan et al. (1987).  The data format is provided to facilitate development of alternative data retrieval algorithms.  Estimated values for missing data, as well as suspicious observations, are flagged.  The data are retrievable by station list, state, latitude-longitude range, and hydrologic unit code from compact digital read-only memory (CD ROM).  CD-ROM copies are available from the second author.

TI Capillary thermomechanics in serially porous media, with implications
   for randomly porous media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Visions of a single mobile substance present as two rival phases more or less cleanly segregated by capillarity between rival strata of a serially porous medium (a "discontinuum") imply explicit testable equations for externally measured capillary thermo-osmotic pressures and capillary thermo-osmosis, with implications for thermomechanical consolidation, dilation, and cracking. Underlying equations assume fluid phases governed by the laws of surface tension and viscous flow, moderated by an appropriate form of the Clapeyron equation. Derived phenomenological coefficients in macroscopic equations for steady coupled transports of mass and heat include only pathlength-weighted fluid and heat conductances for rival domains and the heat of phase transformation. Expressions emphasize the phase-specific nature of Onsager's reciprocity principle and apply to serial media held within permeameters set up for measuring either "isothermal" or "adiabatic" mass transport or held within sealed containers intended for measurements of "thermal conductivities." Results clarify unmet challenges facing modelers of similar processes and attributes in randomly porous media.

TI Travel times of nonlocal dispersion and their geoelectric approximation
   in Nevada's fractured welded tuffs
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID TRUNCATED POWER VARIOGRAMS; TRANSPORT; FIELDS
AB This technical note argues the importance of incorporating nonlocal dispersion effects when modeling contaminant travel times. Using the transport theory of Di Federico and Neuman [1998], expressions for nonlocal contaminant travel times and breakthrough are developed. They show that nonlocal travel times are significantly faster than their local (Fickian) counterpart and that nonlocal breakthrough occurs significantly earlier than Fickian. As an illustrative example, nonlocal breakthrough curves for Nevada's fractured welded tuffs, a common rock unit found at the U.S. Department of Energy's Yucca Mountain Project, are approximated using the electrical-hydraulic conductivity correlation theory and measurements of Pumance and Andricevic [2000a, 2000b]. At the 5 km compliance point the approximation shows that nonlocal contaminant breakthrough occurs similar to5 times earlier than what is predicted by the Department of Energy's Fickian model.

ID SOIL LOSS EQUATION; DISTRIBUTED APPROACH; FIELD
AB The sediment delivery processes due to the travel along a hydraulic path having an uniform slope and to the concave shape of the path are modelled. In particular, using a power equation for modelling the slope profile and RUSLE with two different expressions of the topographic factors, a criterion to define the erosion active slope length, i.e. the slope length in which no deposition processes occur, is initially proposed. Then, the RUSLE equation is adapted to concave profiles by a correction factor of the topographic factors depending on slope curvature. Finally, the deduced relationships (equations (19) and (27)) for correcting the topographic factors for a concave slope are experimentally tested, comparing the calculated sediment yield values with the measurements carried out at the outlets of three small Calabrian basins.

AB This paper aims at initiating a fundamental understanding of the suspended load transport of river sediment in unsteady flow. Laboratory erosion tests as well as artificial flood experiments are used to evaluate the influence of the transient regime on the transport efficiency of the flow. The erosion experiments reveal that the transport capacity is augmented when the unsteadiness of the flow increases. However, the influence of the transient regime is counteracted by the cohesive properties of the river bed. Field experiments with artificial floods released from a reservoir into a small canal confirm these findings and show a relationship between the friction velocity and the suspended load transport. An appropriate parameter beta is proposed to evaluate the impact of the transient regime on the transport of suspended sediment.

AB The purpose of this study is to determine if concepts in terrestrial channel network analysis provide insight on intertidal creek network development and to present new metrics for their analysis. We delineated creek network geometry using high-resolution digital images of intertidal marsh near Georgetown, South Carolina. Analyses reveal that intertidal creek networks may be topologically random. Length-area relationships suggest that salt marsh and terrestrial networks have similar scaling properties, although the marsh networks are more elongate than terrestrial networks. To account for recurrent water exchange between creek basins at high tide, we propose that the landscape unit of geomorphic analyses should be the salt marsh island as opposed to salt marsh creek drainage basin area. Using this approach, the relationship between maximum channel length per island and island area is well described by a power function. A similar power relationship exists for cumulative channel length versus island area, giving a nearly unit slope; this implies that marsh islands have a spatially uniform drainage density. Since the island boundaries are easily identified in remote sensing, taking the island as the unit of geomorphic analysis will eliminate discrepancies in delineating basin boundaries and preclude the need for defining basin area in intertidal landscapes. Analyses and results presented here may be used to quantify salt marsh reference condition and provide indicator variables to assess salt marsh disturbance.

AB We have designed and tested a passive headspace sampler for the collection of noble gases that allows for the precise calculation of dissolved gas concentrations from measured gas mixing ratios. Gas permeable silicon tubing allows for gas exchange between the headspace in the sampler volume and the dissolved gases in the adjacent water. After reaching equilibrium, the aqueous-phase concentration is related to the headspace concentration by Henry's law. Gas exchange between the water and headspace can be shut off in situ, preserving the total dissolved gas pressure upon retrieval. Gas samples are then sealed in an all metal container, retaining even highly mobile helium. Dissolved noble gas concentrations measured in these diffusion samplers are in good agreement with traditional copper tube aqueous-phase samples. These significantly reduce the laboratory labor in extracting the gases from a water sample and provide a simple and robust method for collecting dissolved gas concentrations in a variety of aqueous environments.

ID POROUS BUILDING-MATERIALS; ANOMALOUS DIFFUSION
AB The Green-Ampt model for infiltration into homogeneous soils predicts a monotonically decreasing infiltration rate and a wetting front that initially advances as the square root of time. Infiltration in heterogeneous soils, however, can exhibit non-monotonic infiltration rates and wetting front advances that differ from the square root of time ("anomalous diffusion").
   Here it is postulated, that if the length scales of the heterogeneities can be assumed to be power law distributed, it may be appropriate to model infiltration in heterogeneous soils in terms of fractional derivatives. Then, by expressing the hydraulic flux as a Caputo fractional derivative (order 0 < alpha <= 1) of the head, a fractional Green-Ampt infiltration model is obtained. It is shown that solutions of this model predict non-monotonic and anomalous diffusion behaviors consistent with observations in field infiltration trials; a finding that indicates that a non-local moisture flux model, based on fractional derivatives, is a plausible model for describing infiltration into heterogeneous soils.

AB The equations for a compositional model for simulation of a two-phase, three-component system with inter-phase mass transfer are developed. Emphasis is placed on development of inter-phase mass transfer equations for incorporation of rate-limited inter-phase mass transfer. Due to the nature of the three-component systems considered, a single-film model may be inadequate and a two-film model must be utilized. A two-film model accounts for the simultaneous transfer of components in both directions across phase interfaces. The effect of interaction between components on diffusion is considered using a general form of Fick's Law. A Hand Plot representation of ternary phase behavior is chosen since it allows for straightforward calculation of miscibility of bulk phases under conditions of local non-equilibrium. The developed set of equations form the basis for a numerical model to simulate the enhanced removal of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) from porous media using single-component alcohol floods.

AB Subsurface geochemical and biological transformations often influence fluid flow by altering the pore space morphology and related hydrologic properties such as porosity and permeability. In most coupled-processes models changes in porosity are inferred from geochemical and biological process models using mass-balance. The corresponding evolution of permeability is estimated using (semi-) empirical porosity-permeability functions such as the Kozeny-Carman equation or power-law functions. These equations typically do not account for the heterogeneous spatial distribution and morphological irregularities of the geochemical precipitates and biomass. As a result, predictions of permeability evolution are generally unsatisfactory. In this communication, we demonstrate the significance of pore-scale precipitate distribution on porosity-permeability relations using high resolution simulations of fluid flow through a single pore interspersed with crystals. Based on these simulations, we propose a modification to the Kozeny-Carman model that accounts for the shape of the deposits. Limited comparison with published experimental data suggests the plausibility of the proposed conceptual model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plots of solute concentration against discharge have been used to relate stream hydrochemical variations to processes of flow generation, using data collected at four streams in the Catskill Mountains, New York, during the Episodic Response Project of the US Environmental Protection Agency. Results suggest that a two-component system of shallow and deep saturated subsurface flow, in which the two components respond simultaneously during hydrologic events, may be applicable to the study basins. Using a large natural sea-salt sodium input as a tracer for precipitation, it is argued that an additional distinction can be made between preevent and event water travelling along the shallow subsurface flow path. Pre-event water is thought to be displaced by infiltrating event water, which becomes dominant on the falling limb of the hydrograph. Where, as appears to be the case for sulfate, a solute equilibrates rapidly within the soil, the pre-event-event water distinction is unimportant. However, for some solutes there are clear and consistent compositional differences between water from the two sources, evident as a hysteresis loop in concentration-discharge plots. Nitrate and acidity, in particular, appear to be elevated in event water following percolation through the organic horizon. Consequently, the most acidic, high nitrate conditions during an episode generally occur after peak discharge. A simple conceptual model of episode runoff generation is presented on the basis of these results. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB [1] Water is a key resource in determining the composition and structure of savanna ecosystems. In this study we present a simple cellular automata model in which death and reproduction chances of trees and grasses are based on the dynamical description of plant water stress by a probabilistic ecohydrological point model, using the parameterization for a Texas savanna. The results show that the model behavior, despite its simplicity, can be linked to ecological reality: the model yields a dynamic tree-grass coexistence driven by the annual rainfall, and the space-time behavior shows that both random and clustered tree distributions for periods up to 100 years can be observed. Both temporal and spatial model output display fractal characteristics suggesting the possibility of a self-organized critical dynamics. Thus power law behavior is observed in both the spectral density function and the cluster size distribution. The presence of spatial fractal characteristic opens avenues for more thorough model testing.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB An exact mathematical solution to Laplace's equation is presented for appropriate boundary conditions associated with the problem of dual-pipe subirrigation and drainage. The solution can be used to determine a flow net within the groundwater flow region and the associated water table shape. The solution is general. The effects of several hydraulic and geometrical parameters on the groundwater system, such as thickness of saturated zone, position of subirrigation and drainage pipes, heads in the subirrigation and drainage pipes, crop evapotranspiration, fraction of inflowing subirrigation water that exits through the drains, and the aquifer hydraulic conductivity system are evaluated. Calculations are presented showing how pipe spacing affects the shape of the water table. For example, with hydraulic conductivity of 10 m/d, evapotranspiration of 0.01 m/d, drainpipe radius of 0.05 m, and subirrigation pipe radius of 0.0375 m, calculations show that the maximum water table elevation for a pipe spacing of 40 m is 0.64 m greater than for a pipe spacing of 16 m when 40% of the input subirrigation water volume is being removed from the system by drainage. Finally, the general mathematical solution can be used to predict chemical movement as well as water flow through the system.

AB Globally, many rivers are experiencing declining water quality, for example, with altered levels of sediments, salts, and nutrients. Effective water quality management requires a sound understanding of how and why water quality differs across space, both within and between river catchments. Land cover, land use, land management, atmospheric deposition, geology and soil type, climate, topography, and catchment hydrology are the key features of a catchment that affect: (1) the amount of suspended sediment, nutrient, and salt concentrations in catchments (i.e., the source), (2) the mobilization ,and (3) the delivery of these constituents to receiving waters. There are, however, complexities in the relationship between landscape characteristics and stream water quality. The strength of this relationship can be influenced by the distance and spatial arrangement of constituent sources within the catchment, cross correlations between landscape characteristics, and seasonality. A knowledge gap that should be addressed in future studies is that of interactions and cross correlations between landscape characteristics. There is currently limited understanding of how the relationships between landscape characteristics and water quality responses can shift based on the other characteristics of the catchment. Understanding the many forces driving stream water quality and the complexities and interactions in these forces is necessary for the development of successful water quality management strategies. This knowledge could be used to develop predictive models, which would aid in forecasting of riverine water quality. (C) 2017 The Authors. WIREs Water published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe precipitated snow crystals. The newly-fallen snow crystals were obtained in storms at Beltsville, Maryland, and at Bearden Mountain near Davis, West Virginia, USA. The snow samples were mounted on modified SEM stubs, frozen in liquid nitrogen, sputter coated with platinum, and imaged with an electron beam. Many types of precipitated snow crystals were observed including hexagonal plates, columns, needles, stellar dendrites, bullets, graupel, and rimed crystals. The SEM techniques that were developed can be used for quantitative measurements of size, shape and structure of crystals. SEM of precipitated snow appears to have direct application for the inference of atmospheric and cloud conditions where the snow crystals formed and travelled to the ground and for the development of a relationship between snow crystal type and snowfall intensity and amount. The SEM technique provides a new procedure to record permanently snow crystal conditions during winter storms.

AB This work investigates the effects of modifying the runoff production mechanism used in the Willgoose-Bras-Rodiguez-Iturbe basin evolution model from Hortonian to subsurface saturation. The modified model also simulates basins that reproduce well common geomorphological statistics. This result confirms the ability of the model to adapt to different hydrological environments. The most important difference between the original and the modified model appears in the evolution of the hypsometric curve, particularly in the transition between saturated and unsaturated nodes. The role of mass movement due to diffusive processes (such as rain splash and rock slides) is more significant in the modified model due to decreased role of wash in unsaturated regions. A measure is developed to quantify the sensitivity of the model to initial conditions. Evolutions were found to separate in time following a power law, explaining the apparent randomness present in catchments simulated with only slight perturbations in their initial conditions. This apparent randomness is the result of the weakly chaotic features of the model.

TI Hydraulic power capacity of water distribution networks in uncertain

AB Water distribution systems throughout the United States are in various and uncertain stages of deterioration. Large capital expenditures are needed for their maintenance, modernization, and revitalization. Failures of the systems to supply adequate flow and pressure are adverse to the long-term economic growth and prosperity of the nation. Modeling the uncertain capacity of the distribution network is essential to allocating limited resources to components requiring the most rehabilitation. Network capacity and reliability are related to the uncertain conditions of pipes in the system. Some approaches to measuring a hydraulic capacity have been based on specifying flow volume alone without accounting for pressure. This paper introduces the combining of requirements for volume and pressure in a single dimension, the hydraulic power. Next, the hydraulic power capacity is defined as the probability that there exists a feasible flow of hydraulic power in the water: distribution network. The probabilistic assessment of hydraulic power capacity is demonstrated in a small example under the assumptions of (1) fixed, known maximum inflows (supply) and minimum outflows (demand), (2) uncertain capacities for hydraulic power in individual pipes, reflecting uncertain conditions of pipe decay and roughness, and (3) an optional operating rule corresponding to a fixed minimum total loss of power in the network.

AB This article reviews the relationship between mining and water governance with an emphasis on Latin America. Focusing on the last decade, it identifies three major shifts in global mineral relations: (1) changes to corporation-community relations, most noticeable in corporate social responsibility projects; (2) changes to state-society relations, where there has been a simultaneous strengthening of international support for community rights and a reassertion of the nation-state through so-called 'resource nationalism'; and (3) challenges to the notion of 'community,' which must now stretch to encompass small-scale and artisanal miners. While examining each of these thematic shifts, the paper draws out the relationship between mining and water, suggesting that attention to the 'alloyed waterscape' of global mining would provide a compelling conceptual lens through which to explore dynamics that transcend scales and institutional divides.

AB When the unsaturated flow equation is solved with the finite difference method, the water flux between two adjacent nodes of the grid is approximated with a discrete form of Darcy's law. It requires the average value of the hydraulic conductivity in the considered grid block. Since the hydraulic conductivity in unsaturated soil is a highly nonlinear function of the water potential, the nodal conductivities can vary by multiple orders of magnitude, which makes the choice of the appropriate averaging procedure a nontrivial task. In this paper we present a new method to calculate the internodal conductivity for an arbitrary type of the conductivity function and arbitrary large grid size. It is based on the analysis of approximate profiles of the water potential head for steady flow between nodes. Numerical experiments show that the method is reasonably accurate for a wide range of soil types, for both steady and unsteady flow simulations.

TI Water banks and environmental water demands: Case of the Klamath Project
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE water bank; environmental use; drought; Klamath Basin; agricultural
   production; irrigation efficiency
AB Demand for water for environmental uses, such as to provide critical habitat for endangered species, has increased competition for agricultural water supplies. In the western United States, a significant portion of these water demands is to increase in-stream flows. Given that Endangered Species Act (ESA) requirements supersede prior appropriation rights, ESA water demands have the potential to reduce agricultural diversions, particularly in times of drought. This situation occurred in 2001 in the Klamath Basin of southern Oregon and northern California: an ESA-related judicial ruling on the needs of several endangered fish species resulted in a major reduction in water diversions to the Klamath Reclamation Project. Using the Klamath Basin as an empirical backdrop, this study examines the potential benefits and challenges of water banks to mitigate damages to appropriative water rights holders and to provide water for environmental purposes. Results from this case study indicate that water banks are a potentially cost effective way to meet environmental needs. This study, however, illustrated several of the challenges of implementing a water bank given that modifications to the proposed bank are needed to achieve cost efficiency. Specifically, expanded trading is needed, both intraproject and interproject, to achieve the objectives of providing environmental water at minimum cost to society.

AB Relationships between gravimetric soil moisture content (w) and matric potential (phi(m)), and between volumetric soil moisture content (theta(v)) and pressure head (h) were approximated for the unsaturated zone on Long Island, New York. Soil samples were collected from two sites using a hand auger. The soil moisture content was determined using the filter-paper (w(f)) and gravimetric (w) methods, respectively. The w, was then used in an empirical equation to estimate phi(m). Each set of phi(m) and w was combined with a straight-line empirical model to obtain a w(phi(m)) relationship. Soil phi(m) was converted to h, and w to the volumetric moisture content theta(v), in order to produce a theta(v)(h) curve. Graphical and statistical comparison showed that the resulting theta(v)(h) curves fell within one order of magnitude of similar curves generated by a more sophisticated non-linear model developed previously. The simplicity and low cost of the filter-paper approach described in this study recommends it for preliminary studies of hydraulic properties in the unsaturated zone.

ID FLOWS; STRESS
AB The main aim of this study is the experimental investigation of friction velocities and shear stresses in rivers under unsteady flow conditions. Special measurements of mean velocities and other hydraulic parameters were made in two small lowland rivers in central Poland. Four controlled flood waves were released and analysed in the selected reaches. The main hydrometric characteristics and the relationship between water level and discharge were established. Friction velocities were obtained directly from the full St Venant equations of motion, as well as from only the steady momentum equation, and their time-dependent forms were established. Both these approaches provided similar results when the unsteadiness parameter was relatively low. II appeared that real friction velocities were much larger than those obtained from the common uniform flow formula. The passing hydrograph influenced the value of the shear velocity significantly.

DT Article
AB Data collected over a 14 year period (1977-1990) at three river stations have been used to study long term behaviour, trends and possible future changes of water temperature in the Exe Basin, Devon, UK. Long term mean temperatures are influenced by site elevation and catchment land use. Seasonal variation approximates a simple sine-generated curve and diurnal fluctuation is greater in spring than in autumn months. Significant rising trends were evident for the majority of water temperature parameters investigated and were related to air temperature changes and land use effects. Coupling of possible scenarios for future air temperature change with relationships between mean air and water temperatures and between extreme and mean water temperatures, suggests that significant increases in stream temperatures may occur by the middle of the next century, especially in small upland catchments during summer months.

AB The integrodifferential equation for the spatial second moments X of the ensemble mean concentration in a heterogeneous aquifer is nonlinear due to statistical dependence of the particle displacement on X. This nonlinear equation is either linearized or quasi-linearized in previous studies to derive the linear and quasi-linear theories of time-dependent macrodispersion in aquifers. In this study a fully nonlinear analysis is carried out by solving the integrodifferential equation for X numerically and iteratively. The effects of the variance of log hydraulic conductivities sigma(Y)(2), the local Peclet number P-e, and the anisotropic ratio e are then investigated. Results show that in both statistically isotropic and anisotropic media, as compared with the linear theories, the effect of nonlinearity in X is to reduce the spatial longitudinal variance, X(11), and enhance the transverse spreading of a solute plume except in isotropic media with sigma(Y)(2) less than or equal to 1, where the linear theories may underestimate the longitudinal spreading of a solute. It is also shown that the effect of local dispersion on X(11) can be neglected when P-e greater than or equal to 10 but on the transverse macrodispersion, this effect is significant for P-e as large as 100. Nevertheless, the effect of P-e on macrodispersion is secondary as compared with the effect of nonlinearity in X. Application of the nonlinear results shows good fits to the observed spatial variances df tracer concentration in the Borden experiment and excellent agreement with the simulated variances from recent Monte Carlo Simulations.

AB While rainfall intermittency is a dynamical phenomenon, little progress has been made in the literature on the link between rainfall intermittency and atmospheric dynamics. We present the basic dynamical models of intermittency that are phenomenologically most similar to rainfall. Pomeau-Manneville Type-III and On-Off. We then illustrate each type with both a 1-D iterative map and a corresponding stochastic process stressing the appearance of these dynamics in high-dimensional (stochastic) systems as opposed to low-dimensional chaotic systems We show that the pdf of rainfall intensities, the pdf of "laminar phases" (periods of zero rainfall intensity), and the spectrum of the rainfall series all have power-law behavior that is broadly consistent with intermittency in the classic types. Using a seasonal analysis, we find that summer convective rainfall at daily and sub-daily scales seems consistent with features of Type-III intermittency The correspondence with Type-III intermittency and a preliminary entropic analysis further suggest that rainfall may be an example of sporadic randomness, blending deterministic and stochastic components (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
AB This paper briefly summarizes the results of a four-year research project carried out for the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Vienna, Austria. The main objective was the development of a deterministic model for the estimation of the distribution of extreme precipitation in complex terrain. The orographic component of precipitation is conceptually divided into a part directly generated by dynamic uplift and a part originating from convective activity. The model for the first type of precipitation enhancement is based on the theory of linear two-dimensional air flow over mountains. A dynamically consistent flow field and explicit simulation of the seeder-feeder mechanism are the main improvements compared to an earlier version of this model (Haiden et al., 1990). The assessment of convective precipitation is based on a new parameterization using results of an analytical model of thermally induced upslope flow. A comparison of model results with observations shows reasonable agreement regarding the structure of the precipitation fields.

The transfer of heat downward in the upper part of the soil is enhanced by the vaporization and movement of water and organic compounds. Available information on the changes in the chemistry of vaporized organic compounds is summarized and discussed. An operational theory describing the formation of a highly water repellent soil condition during Ale is presented. The relationship between the formation of this fire-related watershed condition and subsequent surface runoff and erosion from wildland ecosystems is explored. Worldwide literature describing fire-induced water repellency is reviewed and summarized. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB At a global scale the troposphere is a closed water vapour reservoir with interlinked cycles of heat and water.  The global (macroscale) water vapour dynamics are analysed in three stages:  (a) a semi-empirical simulation procedure quantifying the internal relationships among the vapour pressure gradients at the Earth's surface, within the overheated and unsaturated near-surface layer, and the precipitation formation zone; (b) an analytical description of the effect of changing the Earth's surface temperature on the vapour pressure gradient at cloud base, giving insight into the feedback mechanism between the Earth's surface evaporation and precipitation formation; and (c) a combination of the previous two stages leading to the equilibrium criteria for vertical vapour flux.  Needs and opportunities for applications combined with other approaches in climate research are outlined.  Fuller details are given elsewhere (Szesztay, 1991).

AB Relative to those at sub-bankfull flow, hydraulic conditions at overbank flow, whether in the channel or on the floodplain, are poorly understood. Here, velocity conditions are analysed over an unusually wide range of flows in the and zone river of Cooper Creek with its complex system of anastomosing channels and large fluctuations in floodplain width. At-a-station hydraulic geometry relationships reveal sharp discontinuities in velocity at the inbank-overbank transition, the nature of the discontinuity varying with the degree of flow confinement and the level of channel-floodplain interaction. However, despite inter-sectional differences, velocities remain modest throughout the flow range in this low-gradient river, and the large increases in at-a-station discharge are principally accommodated by changes in cross-sectional area.
   Velocity distribution plots suggest that within-channel conditions during overbank flow are characterized by a central band of high velocity which penetrates far toward the bed, helping to maintain already deep cross-sections. Floodplain resistance along Cooper Creek is concentrated at channel bank tops where vegetation density is highest, and the subsequent flow retardation is transmitted across the surface of the channels over distances as large as 50-70 m. The rough floodplain surface affects flood wave transmission, producing significant decreases in wave speeds downstream. The character of the wave-speed-discharge relationship also changes longitudinally, from log-linear in the upper reaches to nonlinear where the floodplain broadens appreciably. The nonlinear form is similar in several respects to relationships proposed for more humid rivers, with flood wave speed reaching an intermediate maximum at about four-fifths bankfull discharge before decreasing to a minimum at approximately Q(2.33). It does not regain the value at the intermediate maximum until the 10 year flood, by which time floodplain depths have become relatively large and broad floodways more active.

AB Naturally transient flow (NTF) occurs when a groundwater regime fails to accommodate geologic changes. This paper describes a conspicuous NTF signature entirely within a low-permeability shale in an eroded basin. Flow in the shale appears to be a lagging hydrodynamic response to mechanical rebound and cooling from erosion; careful, long-term pressure measurements revealed a consistent pattern of low hydraulic head with the minimum within the shale. Available data are sufficient to rule out alternate causes of the pressure regime, and to construct a meaningful quantitative model of the effects of erosion. The shale behaves as a Kelvin substance in tests, but theoretical considerations suggest that its deformation during erosion mimics elastic behavior, permitting the model to be based on poroelasticity. Pressure patterns similar to that observed can be produced by incorporating into the model independent estimates of the shale's hydraulic, mechanical, and thermal properties and a reconstruction of the area's erosion history. The results confirm that local permeability is between 10(-21) and 10(-20) m2 (hydraulic conductivity between 10(-14) and 10(-13) m/s), in contrast to the higher regional permeability of 2 x 10(-16) m2 (hydraulic conductivity of 2 x 10(-9) m/s) determined in an earlier study. Exploration techniques employed in this study could reveal similar NTF regimes in the future.

AB Stationarity assumptions of linked human-water systems are frequently invalid given the difficult-to-predict changes affecting such systems. In this case water planning occurs under conditions of deep or severe uncertainty, where the statistical distributions of future conditions and events are poorly known. In such situations predictive system simulation models are typically run under different scenarios to evaluate the performance of future plans under different conditions. Given that there are many possible plans and many possible futures, which simulations will lead to the best designs? Robust Decision Making (RDM) and Info-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) provide a structured approach to planning complex systems under such uncertainty. Both RDM and IGDT make repeated use of trusted simulation models to evaluate different plans under different future conditions. Both methods seek to identify robust rather than optimal decisions, where a robust decision works satisfactorily over a broad range of possible futures. IGDT efficiently charts system performance with robustness and opportuneness plots summarising system performance for different plans under the most dire and favourable sets of future conditions. RDM samples a wider range of dire, benign and opportune futures and offers a holistic assessment of the performance of different options. RDM also identifies through 'scenario discovery' which combinations of uncertain future stresses lead to system vulnerabilities. In our study we apply both frameworks to a water resource system planning problem: London's water supply system expansion in the Thames basin, UK. The methods help identify which out of 20 proposed water supply infrastructure portfolios is the most robust given severely uncertain future hydrological inflows, water demands and energy prices. Multiple criteria of system performance are considered: service reliability, storage susceptibility, capital and operating cost, energy use and environmental flows. Initially the two decision frameworks lead to different recommendations. We show the methods are complementary and can be beneficially used together to better understand results and reveal how the particulars of each method can skew results towards particular future plans.

   RATES; SAND
AB Transient bed profiles in alluvial channels are generally modeled using diffusion (or dynamic) waves and assuming equilibrium between detachment and deposition rates. Equilibrium sediment transport can be considerably affected by an excess (or deficiency) of sediment supply due to mostly flows during flash floods or floods resulting from dam break or dike failure. In such situations the sediment transport process occurs under nonequilibrium conditions, and extensive changes in alluvial river morphology can take place over a relatively short period of time. Therefore the study and prediction of these changes are important for sustainable development and use of river water. This study hence developed a mathematical model based on the kinematic wave theory to model transient bed profiles in alluvial channels under nonequilibrium conditions. The kinematic wave theory employs a functional relation between sediment transport rate and concentration, the shear-stress approach for flow transport capacity, and a relation between flow velocity and depth. The model satisfactorily simulated transient bed forms observed in laboratory experiments.

AB This study examines changes in peat volume in a mined peatland near Lac St Jean, Quebec, during the spring and summer of 1995 and 1996, and the implication for water storage changes. Lowering of the water table caused drainage above the water table, but the specific yield (S-y) of the peat was relatively small (0.48), and did not adequately describe the water storage change. Lowering of the water table also caused surface subsidence, which was shown to be partly due to shrinkage above the water table (<3.6 cm), and partly due to compression of the saturated peat (about 6 cm). Measured total surface subsidence ranged from 6.5 to 10 cm. The change in pear volume occurred over the entire depth of the peat deposit (b), and so the storativity due to peat compression (bS(s)), estimated to be 0.13, was more important than specific yield in determining water storage changes. Total storativity (S-tot) was best estimated as the sum S-y + bS(s).
   Changes in peat volume in the 0-3 cm layer were evident in the temporally variable bulk density (83-101 kg m(-3)). Its relationship with Volumetric moisture content was highly hysteretic, reflecting the complexity of the process in the unsaturated zone. However, there was a linear relationship with water tension, suggesting a more direct causal relationship. Changes in pest volume were also recorded below the water table, as the volumetric water content of the saturated peat decreased by 3.5% over the season. Since this applied to a relatively thick layer of peat, its total effect was greater than shrinkage in the zone above the water table. It was concluded that most peatland water balances should make account of storage changes associated with peat Volume changes, and that peat volume changes may increase the water limitations to plants when the water table drops below the surface.

AB Snow cover is found across extensive areas of the northern hemisphere during the winter and early spring seasons. Meltwater provided by this snow cover can be an important source of freshwater for agriculture, domestic uses and hydroelectric power. Rapid ablation of the snowpack, however, can also pose environmental hazards such as flooding.
   The ability to forecast meltwater quantities is dependent upon a knowledge of the factors influencing the snowmelt process. This paper employs a hybrid modelling and synoptic climatological approach to investigate the relationships between synoptic weather patterns, surface energy fluxes and midwinter snowmelt in the northern Great Plains. The first objective of this study is to identify distinct synoptic patterns that are associated with days where significant snow cover ablation occurred. The second objective is to evaluate the relationships between synoptic-scale weather patterns, snow surface energy transfers and snowmelt. A case study of 21 February 1975 is used to illustrate these relationships. Unlike the other synoptic-type studies, which rely on empirically derived energy flux data from single index sires, this study employs a physically based snowpack model to generate estimates of energy fluxes, The use of modelled fluxes instead of measured values allows for a more spatially extensive analysis as surface fluxes over the entire study region can be analysed in conjunction with the prevailing synoptic-scale weather patterns.
   Three major synoptic types, characterized by the presence of a midlatitude cyclone, are associated with large midwinter snowmelt episodes in the northern Great Plains. The ease study illustrates how variations in temperature, humidity, cloud cover and wind speeds associated with such cyclonic storms can play a major role in affecting snow surface-atmosphere energy exchanges, As expected, elevated wind speeds and stronger temperature and humidity gradients significantly increased the transfers of sensible and latent heat between the snow surface and the atmosphere. Increased cloud cover near the low pressure centre reduced incoming solar radiation but through counter radiation also reduced the loss of long-wave radiation. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The influence of trees on the ground thermal regime is important to the overall winter energy exchange in a snow-covered, forested watershed. In this work, spatial zones around a single conifer tree were defined and examined for their controls on the snow cover, snow-ground interface temperatures and frozen ground extent. A large white spruce (Picea glauca), approximately 18 m tall with a crown diameter of 7.5 m and located in northern Vermont, was the subject of this study. The tree was instrumented with thermistors to measure the snow-ground interface temperature between the tree trunk and 6 m from the tree into undisturbed snow. Four distinct zones around the conifer are defined that affect the snow distribution characteristics: adjacent to the trunk; the tree well; the tree crown perimeter; and the unaffected area away from the tree. At the time of peak snow accumulation and during the ablation season, snow depth and density profiles were measured. The area beneath the canopy accumulated 34% of the snow accumulated in the undisturbed zone. By the end of the ablation season, the depth of snow under the canopy had decreased to 18% of the undisturbed snow depth. The tree and branch characteristics of spruce in this temperate climate resulted in a different snow depth profile compared with previous empirical relationships around a single conifer. A new relationship is presented for snow distribution around conifer trees that has the ability to better fit data from a variety of conifer types than previously published relationships. Less snow beneath the canopy led to colder snow-ground interface temperatures than measured in undisturbed snow. The depth of frozen ground in the different zones was modelled using a simple analytical solution that showed deeper frost penetration in the tree well than beneath the undisturbed snow.

AB In this paper, we propose a noninvasive method for monitoring three-dimensional (3-D) spatial and temporal variations of soil water content in the field, soil moisture tomography. The basic idea of the method originates from Archie's relationship between soil resistivity and water content. Initially, 88 electrodes were densely buried within a 3.5 m x 3.5 m square area, and potentials at the electrodes were measured by pole-pole and Wenner array methods at given time intervals. An inversion calculation of the 3-D soil resistivity was then conducted based on these potential data. Next, 46 soil samples were taken at representative positions in the square, and the parameters in the Archie's relationship were measured in the laboratory. Then, the 3-D distributions of the parameters were obtained by a distance weight interpolation method. Finally, based on Archie's relationship and the 3-D distribution of the soil resistivity and the related parameters, 3-D distributions of soil water content were calculated. To evaluate the obtained water content, the calculated water contents were compared with those measured by heat-probe-type soil moisture sensors, and a comparison between the spatial distribution patterns of calculated water content and soil bulk dry density was conducted. The 3-D variations of the calculated water content during a rainfall event were also analyzed. The results show that there are +/-0.10 cm(3)/cm(3) errors in the calculated water content, but between the calculated and the measured water content there exists a good linear relationship. It is possible to use the calculated water content to analyze the very general 3-D distribution characteristics of the soil moisture and investigate the 3-D rainfall infiltration process, the redistribution of soil water after rain, and other hydrological processes in the field. The proposed method is preferred for porous media where the water resistivity is relatively stable.

ID GEOMETRY
AB Accurate field data have been collected along the Febbraro River (central Italian Alps) during quasi-steady, low-flow conditions to investigate the spatial variations of hydraulic and geomorphologic quantities potentially affecting resistance to flow. Detailed uncertainty analysis and weighted least-squares fitting of simple power function relationships to field-derived data are carried out to identify possible interdependencies between observed variables. Mean flow velocity is found to depend on water-surface slope, bed material particle size, and upstream drainage area, whereas its dependence on hydraulic depth appears less susceptible to quantification. Upstream drainage area is found to explain the variations of hydraulic depth, water-surface slope, Gauckler-Strickler conductance coefficient, and (although less significantly) flow discharge. Specifically, a highly significant positive dependence of the Gauckler-Strickler conductance coefficient on the upstream drainage area is found to exist, although anomalies in the variations of hydraulic depth and flow discharge are observed along the stream. The combined use of uncertainty analysis, hydraulic equations, and geomorphological relationships allows a possible characterization of resistance to flow along a steep Alpine stream and, perhaps more importantly, provides useful guidelines for future investigative efforts.

   CAPACITY; SOILS
AB Capillary barriers, consisting of tilted fine over coarse layers under unsaturated conditions, have been suggested as a means to divert water infiltration away from sensitive underground regions. Ross [1990] has developed a relationship for the steady-state diversion length of tilted capillary barriers assuming the quasi-linear set of two-phase characteristic curves. Due to its simplicity, this equation has been used to evaluate potential tilted capillary barrier performance even in cases where the layer characteristic curves are different than the quasi-linear equation set. In the present study, Ross' capillary barrier diversion relationship is extended to other two-phase characteristic curves. This generalization allows for the use of any set of two-phase curves in evaluating tilted capillary barrier performance. This generalized Ross' equation compares well with detailed numerical simulations.

ID FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED MOMENTS
AB A critical issue in parametric methods of frequency analysis, regardless of the phenomenon being modeled. is that of selection of a form of probability distribution to be applied. When one is interested in continuous distributions there exists little theoretical guidance, other than perhaps that provided by the central limit theorem or the (asymptotic) results of extreme value theory, upon which one may base a choice. This paper, in a very general way, introduces a whole new class of probability models which are referred to as distributions of fractional order statistics. The potential efficacies of various member distributions within the class for hydrologic data analysis are also rationalized in a verv intuitive way. Considered in some detail is an application of the theory of fractional order statistics to generalize the Gaussian distribution. Monte Carlo results comparing the performance of the generalized distribution with other common hydrologic models are also set forth.

ID CENSORED-DATA
AB The flow regime of a river can be described using the flow duration curve (FDC), which represents the frequency distribution of flows and can be derived from gauged data. Many resource assessments are required where gauged data are limited or unavailable, thus models for predicting FDCs in ungauged catchments are required. In semiarid environments, such as parts of southern Portugal, river flows often become zero for significant periods of time. This makes modelling the discontinuities in the flow regime using commonly used continuous distributions more difficult. This paper presents the derivation of a regionalized model (from a data set of 67 catchments) for predicting FDCs for ungauged catchments in Portugal, which may be ephemeral. The approach uses the theory of total probability to combine a model for predicting the percentage of time the river is dry with a model for predicting an FDC for the non-zero period. These component parts can be modelled separately, relating them to catchment characteristics such as hydrogeology and climate.

AB Hydrological models are commonly used to perform real-time runoff forecasting for flood warning. Their application requires catchment characteristics and precipitation series that are not always available. An alternative approach is nonparametric modelling based only on runoff series. However, the following questions arise: Can nonparametric models show reliable forecasting? Can they perform as reliably as hydrological models? We performed probabilistic forecasting one, two and three hours ahead for a runoff series, with the aim of ascribing a probability density function to predicted discharge using time series analysis based on stochastic dynamics theory. The derived dynamic terms were compared to a hydrological model, LARSIM. Our procedure was able to forecast within 95% confidence interval 1-, 2- and 3-h ahead discharge probability functions with about 1.40 m(3)/s of range and relative errors (%) in the range [-30; 30]. The LARSIM model and the best nonparametric approaches gave similar results, but the range of relative errors was larger for the nonparametric approaches.

   DENSITY
AB Clay soils, as a result of shrinking-swelling, usually have a capillary crack network. The objective of this presentation is to develop a physically based model of the hydraulic conductivity of a swelling clay matrix with interaggregate capillary cracks only. It is based on a number of assumptions relating in the main to the geometrical characteristics of the capillary crack network and the use of the cubic law for water flow in a water-filled slit. The key assumption speaks about the contraction of the interaggregate capillary crack volume in a drying but saturated clay matrix. The expression for vertical hydraulic conductivity of the network of cracks of width <R is determined by network tortuosity and specific length of crack traces at a horizontal cross section. To check the model, we compared the available data on the hydraulic conductivity of an Israeli clay soil with model predictions of the hydraulic conductivity of an interaggregate capillary crack network in combination with the independent predictions of hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix available in literature. This comparison demonstrated satisfactory agreement.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Stress relief fracturing provides the large mechanical apertures needed for the development of conduit porosity in carbonate aquifers. Examination of valleys incised into Mississippian age limestones throughout the Appalachian plateaus has demonstrated a;consistent pattern taken in the development of conduits in these settings. Master conduits (caves) are found beneath the valley walls in general, not directly beneath the actual surface channel. Common features of the studied ''Cumberland style'' caves are valley-parallel master conduit segments, exceptional concordance of conduit orientation with minor surface topographic variations, development on distinct ''levels,'' and development in a downdip position from master surface streams. The recognition that these conduits form along geologically young fracture systems of increased aperture is a departure-from previous theories of cave origin. Prior theories have either explicitly or implicitly assumed that caves develop along joints and fractures of significant geologic age, related more to regional tectonic forces than to present-day topographic influences.

AB Concurrent floods in multiple locations pose systemic risks to the interconnected economy in East Asia via supply chain disruptions. Despite these significant economic impacts, understanding of the interconnection between rainfall patterns in the region is still currently limited. Here, we analyzed the spatial dependence of the rainfall patterns of 24 megacities in the region using complex analysis theory and discussed the technique's applicability. Each city and rainfall similarity were represented by a node and a link, respectively. Vital-node identification and clustering analysis were conducted using adjacency information entropy and multiresolution community detection. The results of vital-node identification analysis show that high-ranking nodes are cities that are located near main vapor providers in East Asia. Using multiresolution community detection, the groups were clustered to reflect the spatial characteristics of the climate. In addition, the climate links between each group were identified using cross-mutual information considering the delay time for each group. We found a strong bond between Northeast China and the southern Indochinese Peninsula and verified that the links between each group originated from the summer climate characteristics of East Asia. The results of the study show that complex network analysis could be a valuable method for analyzing the spatial relationships between climate factors.

TI Rating curve modelling with Manning's equation to manage instability and
   improve extrapolation
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB The rating curve is the most frequently used methodology for continuous river flow measurement. However, to establish a reliable rating curve is difficult, takes time, and is often impossible when the measurement cross-section is unstable. To overcome this difficulty, the use of a modified form of the Manning equation is suggested to express flow rate as a function of hydraulic radius and longitudinal water surface slope rather than of water level alone, as is the case with the classical stage-discharge relationship. This formulation permits one to integrate the development of the river bed geometry and the hydraulic characteristics of the reach explicitly within the rating curve, in a simple way. The procedure is used and evaluated on the Leysse River in Chambery, France. The results demonstrate the validity and potential of this approach, particularly for extrapolation, when the hydraulic and geometric characteristics are evolving.

AB A nonlinear prediction method, developed based on the ideas gained from deterministic chaos theory, is employed: (a) to predict monthly runoff; and (b) to detect the possible presence of chaos in runoff dynamics. The method first reconstructs the single-dimensional (or variable) runoff series in a multi-dimensional phase space to represent its dynamics, and then uses a local polynomial approach to make predictions. Monthly runoff series observed at the Coaracy Nunes/Araguari River basin in northern Brazil is studied. The predictions are found to be in close agreement with the observed runoff, with high correlation coefficient and coefficient of efficiency values, indicating the suitability of the nonlinear prediction method for predicting the runoff dynamics. The results also reveal the presence of low-dimensional chaos in the runoff dynamics, when an inverse approach is adopted for identification, as: (a) an optimal embedding dimension exists, and (b) the prediction accuracy decreases with an increase in prediction lead lime.

AB Infiltration experiments with intensities varying from 4.1 x 10(-6) to 2.8 x 10(-5) m s(-1) were conducted on a column of undisturbed soil. Flow was investigated using kinematic wave theory. The approach was first applied to the drainage curve of outflow. In this case, preferential flow occurred during intermediate infiltration rates. The approach was further applied to soil moisture variations at three depths of the column. The wetting front dispersion increased with depth according to the analysis of mobile soil moisture contributing to total now, whereas the analysis of mobile soil moisture contributing to rapid flow indicated flow through macropores. The kinematic wave model simulates reasonably well both measured drainage of outflow and of soil moisture. A simple method was used to separate mobile soil moisture contributing to rapid flow and that contributing to diffusive flow. The validity of the model was evaluated by water balance comparison, with particular attention given to the distinction between the two types of soil moisture.

AB This study focuses on how the variability of land surface temperature and vegetation density at the SGP ARM-CART site changes over episodic (day to day) and seasonal time scales using AVHRR satellite data. Four drying periods throughout the year are analyzed. Land surface temperature had an erratic relationship with time exhibiting no deterministic pattern from day-to-day or season-to-season. Furthermore, it did not exhibit spatial pattern persistence. On the other hand, vegetation density had a consistent spatial pattern and temporal decay during average length drying periods (less than 7 days) as well as within a season. However, there were distinct differences in the seasonal pattern of variation between winter and growing seasons. In addition, the paper highlights a methodology to quantify the relationships that exist at the land surface between the primary parameter of interest and the controlling variables.

AB Considering the complexity of the hydric erosion processes in the Wadi Mina basin, due to significant soil heterogeneity, scattered or nonexistent vegetation, and the space and time variability of rainfall, a mapping of the random variable "specific erosion" is attempted. The purpose is to assess the source zones of sediments for an eventual soil conservation strategy upstream from Sidi M'Hamed Benaouda Dam and the associated irrigation perimeter. A principal components analysis and a step-by-step multiple regression have led to a better understanding of the process through the search for functional relationships which can help explain it and which can be transposed to other areas. This attempt at mapping based on kriging shows two different zones: one in the north of the basin, characterized by significant erosion, exceeding 20 t ha(-1), and the other, less affected, in the south.

AB Mathematical expressions are derived for the hydraulic exponents M and N as functions of the gradually varied flow (GVF) depth using a circular channel section. The derived expressions of M(y/d(0)) and N(y/d(0)) for continuously varying depth are compared to exponents M and N proposed by Chow [Chow, V.T., Integrating the equation of gradually varied flow. ASCE, Proc. 81, Vol. 11, 1955] using constant averaged GVF depths. The exponent N shows a remarkable difference (an opposite trend). The computation of the GVF length is calculated using the exponents M and N for varying and constant averaged GVF depths. Numerical integration approach based on the Simpson's rule method is used to calculate the GVF length. The results of the calculated GVF profile length using the derived exponents M(y/d(0)) and N(y/d(0)) are found to be closer to the GVF length calculated from the exact formulation of the GVF dynamic equation. The percentage difference ranges from 0.017 to 6.9% for various bed slopes and GVF depth limits. Using the Chow [ibid.] constant exponents M and N, the calculated GVF length resulted in a wider values with a percentage difference ranges from 1.2 to 130%. Hence, a remarkable improvement of the computation of GVF profile length is achieved using the derived M(y/d(0)) and N(y/d(0)) exponents.

ID ENERGY; WASH; LESSONS; IMPACT
AB COVID-19 has had unprecedented impacts across the international community, with complex and far-reaching consequences. Measures to prevent transmission have led to substantial changes to everyday life, with lockdowns, stay-at-home orders and guidance leading to an increase in people staying indoors. This movement of activity had profound impacts on daily practices, affecting the consumption of resources including water. Likewise, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) practices and infrastructure are crucial tools for the management of disease. Therefore, this review seeks to assess the current literature on the impact of COVID-19 on domestic water use. A web-based rapid evidence review was undertaken to assess and synthesize the theories, methods and empirical evidence emerging across a multidisciplinary body of research to understand how COVID-19 effects everyday water use. Key themes around increased water consumption and changing daily consumption patterns emerged. There was a distinct lack of social science concepts and methodologies in use to understand changing water demand, and the methodological focus was largely quantitative. Key insights and reflections were lacking as a result, for example, there was little research on how the water-related practices, consumption, and demand patterns differed among households. This article makes the case for further qualitative and mixed-method research using social theories, illustrating how social practice theories, as one example, contribute to understanding the dynamics of everyday life during the pandemic. This research would generate deeper understandings of the impacts of COVID-19 on domestic water use as well as an evaluation of the implications these findings could have post-pandemic.

TI Optimal fund assignment and allocation models for pipe repair
   maintenance in leaky water distribution networks
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; DECISION-MAKING
AB In pipe repair maintenance operations for leaky water distribution networks in cities, it is usually the practice that whenever pipe leaks are detected, repair actions are undertaken until the funds assigned are exhausted. The allocation of Limited repair funds to different pipe sections is normally done without careful quantitative analysis but according to an intuitive rule, whereby the section of the larger leak volume receives the larger share of funds. This paper proposes a new modeling approach to determine optimal repair fund allocation to different sections of a city. A basic periodic-review stochastic demand inventory model is first applied to ascertain the optimal funds to be assigned to a city under an assumption of no fund limitation. The model is then extended to determine the optimal allocation of the limited funds to different sections of a city. The models minimize the expected total system cost composed of repair cost, storage cost (of spare parts and materials), and penalty cost for water loss due to lack of funds. Numerical experiments are then conducted to illustrate the applicability of the proposed models, and the characteristics of the optimal solutions with regard to parameter variations are investigated. Data used in the numerical example are taken from actual data of the secondary network of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.

AB The uncertainty of monthly areal mean rainfall estimates, caused by a finite sampling time resolution, is investigated making extensive use of data collected by tipping-bucket rain gauge networks at Darwin, Australia, and Melbourne, Florida. Using a subsampling methodology, the uncertainty is studied for complete area-covering observations occurring at regular time intervals. The analysis indicates that the sampling uncertainty is constrained by the rainfall depth, the sampling frequency, and the domain size. Taking into account that a rain gauge network does not truly reflect the sampling uncertainty one would encounter using complete area-covering observations, such as provided by radar or satellite, a rule of thumb is established for estimating the average sampling uncertainty as a function of the above factors. The estimated root mean square error E, expressed as a percentage of the monthly rainfall amount R(s), is found to be inversely proportional to the rain amount and the domain size A but proportional to the sampling time interval Delta T and can be approximated by E = 8.5 x 10(3) x R(s)(-0.6) A(-0.5)Delta T. Within this framework the various results reported in the literature from studies based on using other data and different spatial scales are found to be consistent with our results and among each other. The scaling of our results to timescales other than a month is indicated.

AB Strong relationships have been developed between both global and local phenomena in one season and precipitation in the next four seasons for years when the precipitation is likely to be low (drought years). The relations explain more than 65% of the variance in the precipitation for regions of up to 500,000 km(2) and more than 35% of the variance for up to 1.3 x 10(6) km(2) in eastern Australia. The strong relationships occurred when precipitation was regressed against one of the variables in years that were selected on the basis of the magnitude of a third, so-called partitioning, variable. The relations are shown to be able to provide forecasts of low precipitation in all seasons of the year. Statistical tests show that the strong forecasting relations could not occur by chance.

TI Developing hydroecological models to inform environmental flow

ID ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES; PHYSICAL HABITAT; FRAMEWORK; RIVERS; DISCHARGE;

AB The concept of defining environmental flow regimes to balance the provision of water resources for both human and environmental needs has gained wide recognition. As the authority responsible for water resource management within England, the Environment Agency (EA) uses the Environmental Flow Indicator (EFI), which represents an allowable percentage deviation from the natural flow to determine where water may be available for new abstractions. In a simplified form, the EFI has been used as the hydrological supporting component of Water Framework Directive classification, to flag where hydrological alteration may be contributing to failure to achieve good ecological status, and to guide further ecological investigation. As the primary information source for the EFI was expert opinion, the EA aims to improve the evidence base linking flow alteration and ecological response, and to use this evidence to develop improved environmental flow criteria and implementation tools. Such tools will be required to make predictions at locations with no or limited ecological monitoring data. Hence empirical statistical models are required that provide a means to describe observed variation in ecological sensitivity to flow change. Models must also strike a balance between generic and local relationships. Multilevel (mixed effects) regression models provide a rich set of capabilities suitable for this purpose. Three brief examples of the application of these techniques in defining empirical relationships between flow alteration and ecological response are provided. Establishment of testable hydrological-ecological relationships provides the framework for improving data collection, analysis, and ultimately water resources management models.

DE lag time; sedimentgraph; sediment yield; small basins
AB River basin lag time (LAG), defined as the elapsed time between the occurrence of the centroids of the effective rainfall intensity pattern and the storm runoff hydrograph, is an important factor in determining the time to peak and the peak value of the instantaneous unit hydrograph, IUH. In the procedure of predicting a sedimentgraph (suspended sediment load as a function of time), the equivalent parameter is the lag time for the sedimentgraph (LAG,), which is defined as the elapsed time between the occurrence of the centroids of sediment production during a storm event and the observed sedimentgraph at the gauging station. Results of analyses of rainfall, runoff and suspended sediment concentration event data collected from five small Carpathian basins in Poland and from a 2.31-ha agricultural basin, in central Illinois, USA have shown that LAG., was, in the majority of cases, smaller than LAG, and that a significant linear relationship exists between LAGs and LAG.

ID JUSTICE
AB Despite the important societal consequences of water policy, community attitudes toward planning, ethics, and equity for allocation of water have received little research attention. This preliminary research was conducted to assess the range and structure of planning attitudes and equity and ethical considerations which might be relevant to the general public's evaluation of water allocation systems. The relationship of these to priorities for water allocation were also examined. The results showed a complex structure for planning attitudes. There were also generalized but clearly defined community approaches to water allocation. A number of significant relationships between planning attitudes and philosophies of allocation were shown. Planning attitudes also related to priorities for water allocation. In practical terms the research provides some preliminary, ethically based evaluative criteria which could be applied to allocation decision-making systems. Theoretical research possibilities are also outlined.

DT Article
DE tropical glacier; precipitation; snow; albedo; Bolivia
ID CORDILLERA REAL; BALANCE; CLIMATE
AB The relationships are presented between snowfall and melting on the Zongo Glacier in Bolivia, where precipitation and ablation reach their peaks in the wet season (austral summer). Clouds originate in the Amazon basin and produce precipitation at mid-day in the Andean valleys, then in the afternoon in the mountains. During the gradual build-up of the wet season, from September to December, sporadic snowfalls cover the melting ice. Due to the albedo fluctuations, net solar radiation and melting vary drastically, reaching their yearly maximum values when the snow cover is reduced. In the middle of the wet season, from January to March, snow remains on the glacier surface at low altitude, albedo is high and melting reduced. The dry season from May to August is a period of low ablation interrupted by scarce precipitation events. Melting of tropical glaciers strongly depends on the seasonal distribution of precipitation due to the high albedo of the fresh snow deposited during the summer.

TI COMPARISON OF STEADY FLOWS FROM INFILTRATION RINGS IN GREEN AND AMPT AND
   GARDNER SOILS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The field-saturated hydraulic conductivity K(fs) can be obtained from measurements of the long-time steady flow rates from ring infiltrometers by assuming either that the soil is a ''Green and Ampt'' soil that has a relationship between hydraulic conductivity K and soil water pressure psi, such that K = K(fs), 0 > psi > psi(f); K --> 0, psi < psi(f), or that the soil is a ''Gardner'' soil with an exponential relationship K = K(fs) exp(alphapsi), where a is a constant. It is shown that infiltration into a Green and Ampt soil from a surface source with zero head is the same as that for a Gardner soil with alpha --> infinity (gravity dominant) and with a surface source at a head \psi(fs)\. The shape factor G calculated for Gardner soils using a numerical solution of Richards's equation is used to calculate K(fs) and alpha from ring infiltrometer tests based on Q = [aH/G + a/(alphaG) + pia2]K(fs), where Q is the steady state flow rate, H is the constant ponded head, and a is the ring radius. The equivalent G factor for Green and Ampt soils calculated using electric analogue solutions of Laplace's equation is shown to agree very well with the numerical solution. The slope of the linear relationship between the shape factor and the depth of insertion of the ring divided by the radius of the ring is shown to have a slope approximately equal to 1/pi.

AB The purpose of this paper is to examine the 3D effect on flows at high velocities through homogeneous porous media. Results of numerical simulations of a steady incompressible Newtonian fluid flowing through a 2D and a 3D periodic porous media performed at various Reynolds numbers are presented. The flow patterns are described and the pressure and the shear stress at the fluid/solid surface are analyzed. In accordance with the macroscopic momentum balance equation applied to each periodic cell, the viscous and the pressure drags exerted by the solid grain on the fluid are calculated and their contributions to the deviation from Darcy's law are evaluated. Based on the analysis of flow structures and the evolution of the pressure and the viscous drags, three laminar flow regimes are identified: Darcy, transition and strong inertia. It is shown that the transition zone for the 3D-flow is very narrow in comparison with that of the 2D-flow. As a consequence, the non-Darcy 3D-flow is correctly modeled by Forchheimer's equation. This explains the success of this equation in interpreting most of the experiments performed in real (3D) porous media. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID DIMENSIONAL VIRUS TRANSPORT; KINETICALLY SORBING SOLUTE; POROUS-MEDIA;
   ADSORPTION; INACTIVATION
AB Solutes and colloids moving through porous media often undergo kinetic reactions, such as sorption or degradation. The kinetic reactions are mathematically described by rate laws and their associated rate coefficients. Rate coefficients are often considered to be time invariant, but there is experimental evidence that the coefficients may depend on the travel or residence time of the dissolved or suspended substance. In this paper we present a theoretical approach to describe transport with residence-time-dependent sink/source reaction coefficients. The solution to the transport problem with an arbitrary functional form for the reaction term is expressed in terms of the solution to the nonreactive transport problem. The solution is therefore independent of the nature of the transport process and independent of any specific representation of the reaction coefficients. Applications to a convective-dispersive transport regime are given, and differences between time-dependent and residence-time-dependent reaction coefficients are illustrated with solute breakthrough curves. Depending on the boundary conditions of a specific problem, time-dependent and residence-time-dependent reaction coefficients can lead to very different transport behavior.

The heat loss theory has been used in Iceland for a long time, while the hydraulic theory largely follows the classical ice-jam build-up theories used in known CFD models. The results are combined in a new method to calculate the maximum thickness and the extent of an ice jam. The results compare favorably to the HEC-RAS model for the development of a very large ice jam in Thjorsa River in Iceland, and have been found in good agreement with historical data, collected where a hydroelectric dam project, Urridafoss, is being planned in the Thjorsa River.

ID TRANSPORT; USA; CONTAMINATION; CALIFORNIA; TAILINGS; SYSTEMS; FATE
AB A theory for the evolution of a river floodplain and the associated movement of tracer sediment is applied to the case of the upper Clark Fork River, Montana, whose floodplain is contaminated with tailings derived from historical mining activities. Deposition of mine tailings raised the elevation of the floodplain, which now contributes contaminated sediment to the channel. The theory is capable of reproducing the basic aspects of the system's evolution, including aggradation of the floodplain during the mining era and subsequent net supply of sediment from floodplain to channel after the cessation of mine input. Results indicate that the natural removal of tailings from the floodplain could take thousands of years, a period longer than is required for the channel to simply rework the tailings. The self-stabilizing nature of the model results in an evolution toward a new postmine steady state, with tailings eventually almost entirely removed from the system.

AB The hydraulic properties of an unsaturated homogenous and isotropic soil can be obtained from the unconfined flux out of a disc infiltrometer into the soil over the depth of wetting.  The disc infiltrometer is becoming increasingly popular, but methods of analysis have generally relied on the restrictive assumptions of one-dimensional flow at early times or quasi-steady state flow at large times.  We provide an approximate analytical expression for three-dimensional unsteady, unconfined flow out of a disc infiltrometer, and this includes the geometric effect of the circular source but ignores gravity.  This physically based solution is tested against data obtained from laboratory experiments on repacked material.  The results illustrate that the difference between three-dimensional and one-dimensional flow is linear with time.

AB Models are needed that describe how topography and other watershed characteristics affect the chemical composition of runoff waters, yet little spatially distributed data exist to develop such models. A topographically driven flushing mechanism for nitrate (NO3-) and dissolved organic carbon has been described in recent literature; however, this mechanism has not yet been thoroughly tested. A 24 ha catchment in the Catskill Mountains of New York was clearcut in the winter of 1996-97, resulting in elevated NO3- concentrations in soil water, groundwater and streamflow. We sampled shallow subsurface stormflow (SSSF) and streamflow six times during the spring and summer of 1998, 1 year after the harvest. We used a spatially distributed network of piezometers to investigate the relationship between topography and SSSF chemistry. Several indices of topography were computed, including the commonly employed topographic index of Beven and Kirkby (1979; Hydrological Sciences Bulletin 24: 43-69). Topographic index was positively correlated with NO3- concentrations in SSSF. The strength of the NO3--topography relationship was best explained by antecedent soil temperature and antecedent precipitation conditions. Results suggest a topographically driven flushing of high NO3- shallow soil at the site during storm events. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Catchment-scale hydrological models frequently miss essential characteristics of what determines the functioning of catchments. The most important active agent in catchments is the ecosystem. It manipulates and partitions moisture in a way that supports the essential functions of survival and productivity: infiltration of water, retention of moisture, mobilization and retention of nutrients, and drainage. Ecosystems do this in the most efficient way, establishing a continuous, ever-evolving feedback loop with the landscape and climatic drivers. In brief, hydrological systems are alive and have a strong capacity to adjust themselves to prevailing and changing environmental conditions. Although most models take Newtonian theory at heart, as best they can, what they generally miss is Darwinian theory on how an ecosystem evolves and adjusts its environment to maintain crucial hydrological functions. In addition, catchments, such as many other natural systems, do not only evolve over time, but develop features of spatial organization, including surface or sub-surface drainage patterns, as a by-product of this evolution. Models that fail to account for patterns and the associated feedbacks miss a critical element of how systems at the interface of atmosphere, biosphere and pedosphere function.
   In contrast to what is widely believed, relatively simple, semi-distributed conceptual models have the potential to accommodate organizational features and their temporal evolution in an efficient way, a reason for that being that because their parameters (and their evolution over time) are effective at the modelling scale, and thus integrate natural heterogeneity within the system, they may be directly inferred from observations at the same scale, reducing the need for calibration and related problems. In particular, the emergence of new and more detailed observation systems from space will leadtowards a more robust understanding of spatial organization and its evolution. This will further permit the development of relatively simple time-dynamic functional relationships that can meaningfully represent spatial patterns and their evolution over time, even in poorly gauged environments.

TI MONTHLY TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION FIELDS ON A STORM-FACING MOUNTAIN
   FRONT - STATISTICAL STRUCTURE AND EMPIRICAL PARAMETERIZATION
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an analysis of monthly temperature (T) and precipitation (P) time series at 28 climatologic stations on the storm-facing slope of the Wasatch Range, Utah. The goal is to examine the space-time structure of T and P and to develop an empirical model incorporating both seasonal and elevation effects. Each time series (T or P) is decomposed into the sum of a long-term mean, a seasonal cycle, and a residual random process. The seasonal cycle is well determined by the amplitude and phase of a few harmonics, and the residual noise is approximated by a power law form of the variance spectrum. Empirical correlations are found relating the temporal moments of altitude, allowing the construction of a parametric T-P model as a function of altitude and season. The observed correlations are discussed within the context of the region's synoptic weather patterns. When combined with digital elevation data, the model can be used to estimate seasonal temperature and precipitation fields as input to mountain front hydrologic studies.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop a method for predicting the spatial moments and concentration of a tracer plume conditional to locally measured data.  We set this study in a probabilistic frame due to the inherent inability to characterize deterministically the flow domain.  Our starting point is the Dagan (1984) conceptual model which relates the concentration to the translation of tagged elements of solute mass.  Then, using Darcy's law and the flow equations, we describe that translation using a random function model for the velocity.  Comparison with numerical simulations shows this model to be favorable for variances of the log conductivity as large as 2.56 (Dykstra-Parsons coefficient of 0.8).  It is shown how this random function model is correlated with the hydraulic head and conductivity fields, and furthermore, how it can be made conditional to measured data.  It is concluded that conditioning improves predictions of the spatial moments of the tracer plume by making a more comprehensive use of available data and has a potential for a large range of applications.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF AIR-FLOW ON THE VERTICAL INFILTRATION OF WATER INTO
   SOIL
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID TABLE
AB The vertical flow of air and water into a Gardner soil is investigated numerically and analytically. Instantaneously applying a constant head of water to the soil surface initially produces a rapid diffusive change in air pressure in the soil, and a slower diffusive change in water content. Fluid flow comprises a region of descending water at air entry conditions, below which is a transitional layer of both airflow and water flow, which connects to a region with essentially the initial value of capillary pressure. Four flow regimes are identified. The initial compressive and resistive regimes are associated with air compressibility and viscosity. The well-known sorptive and gravity regimes are established later. During the resistive regime, the main effect of air viscosity arises from airflows in the lower region which cause the water content profile to lag behind the corresponding profiles predicted without effects of air viscosity. A Green and Ampt infiltration law may accurately describe the infiltration process, provided the suction head suggested by Bouwer is selected. Approximate agreement is obtained between the theoretical predictions, and the corresponding accurate numerical results.

AB [1] Numerical models have been widely used to simulate multiphase flow in porous media for a variety of applications (e. g., NAPL migration in subsurface aquifers, carbon sequestration, agriculture, paper production, and petroleum reservoir development). The relationship between the difference in phase pressures and saturation is used as one of the important constitutive relationships in numerical models. Theoretical studies have suggested that this relationship should include a damping coefficient or capillarity coefficient (tau) on the basis of thermodynamic considerations. A literature review suggests that the magnitude of this capillarity coefficient varies by over three orders of magnitude. While recent experimental studies have explored the effect of porous medium properties, effect of domain size, hysteresis, and the imposed boundary conditions on the magnitude of tau, there has been no experimental study investigating the impact of fluid viscosity on tau. This study reports on a series of primary drainage experiments conducted under both static and dynamic conditions in F70 silica sand. Fluid pairs used included water and silicone oil with two differing viscosities and slightly different densities (used as model nonaqueous phase liquids) in addition to air. Water saturation and both wetting and nonwetting phase pressures were measured in a custom-built aluminum column using EC-5 probes and tensiometers at three levels. Results show a strong dependence of the magnitude of the capillarity coefficient on effective fluid viscosity. This implies that consideration should be given for the inclusion of a capillarity coefficient in modeling tools used to simulate multiphase flow when fluids saturations are changing rapidly and when fluids have a large viscosity ratio.

AB Seven catchments of diverse size in Mediterranean Europe were investigated in order to understand the main aspects of their hydrological functioning. The methods included the analysis of daily and monthly precipitation, monthly potential evapotranspiration rates, flow duration curves, rainfall-runoff relationships and catchment internal data for the smaller and more instrumented catchments. The results showed that the catchments were less "dry" than initially considered. Only one of them was really semi-arid throughout the year. All the remaining catchments showed wet seasons when precipitation exceeded potential evapotranspiration, allowing aquifer recharge, "wet" runoff generation mechanisms and relevant baseflow contribution. Nevertheless, local infiltration excess (Hortonian) overland flow was inferred during summer storms in some catchments and urban overland flow in some others. The roles of karstic groundwater, human disturbance and low winter temperatures were identified as having an important impact on the hydrological regime in some of the catchments.

ID RAINFALL
AB In any dam siting study in and regions, rainfall records, runoff measurements and their greatest magnitudes are very important. Unfortunately, the data are scarce and, therefore, empirical approaches and charts obtained from similar regions in other parts of the world are necessary for complete applications. The lack of observed data presents the major problem for runoff modelling in and regions. These regions have characteristically high rainfall intensity and consequent flash floods with large amounts of sediments. Occurrence of rainfall is sporadic, both temporally and spatially, which makes the interpretation of the rainfall-runoff relationship quite difficult. Flood estimations play a significant role in dam siting from the point of view of water availability. This paper presents the basic calculations of floods and sediment amounts that are necessary in dam siting and construction in an and area by considering the southwestern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

AB Electromagnetic induction (EMI) is used widely for hydrological and other environmental studies. The apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), which can be mapped efficiently with EMI, correlates with a variety of important soil attributes. EMI instruments exist with several configurations of coil spacing, orientation, and height. There are general, rule-of-thumb guides to choose an optimal instrument configuration for a specific survey. The goal of this study was to provide a robust and efficient way to design this optimization task. In this investigation, we used machine learning (ML) as an efficient tool for interpolating among the results of many forward model runs. Specifically, we generated an ensemble of 100 000 EMI forward models representing the responses of many EMI configurations to a range of three-layer subsurface models. We split the results into training and testing subsets and trained a decision tree (DT) with gradient boosting (GB) to predict the subsurface properties (layer thicknesses and EC values). We further examined the value of prior knowledge that could limit the ranges of some of the soil model parameters. We made use of the intrinsic feature importance measures of machine learning algorithms to identify optimal EMI designs for specific subsurface parameters. The optimal designs identified using this approach agreed with those that are generally recognized as optimal by informed experts for standard survey goals, giving confidence in the ML-based approach. The approach also offered insight that would be difficult, if not impossible, to offer based on rule-of-thumb optimization. We contend that such ML-informed design approaches could be applied broadly to other survey design challenges.

AB The spatial moments of a contaminant plume undergoing bio-attenuation are coupled to the moments of microbial populations effecting that attenuation. In this paper, a scalable inverse method is developed for estimating field-scale Monod parameters such as the maximum microbial growth rate (mu(max)), the contaminant half saturation coefficient (K-s), and the contaminant yield coefficient The method uses spatial moments that characterize the distribution of dissolved contaminant and active microbial biomass in the aquifer. A finite element model is used to generate hypothetical field-scale data to test the method under both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifer conditions. Two general cases are examined. In the first, Monod parameters are estimated where it is assumed a microbial population comprised of a single bacterial species is attenuating one contaminant (e.g., an electron donor and an electron acceptor). In a second case, contaminant attenuation is attributed to a microbial consortium comprised of two microbial species, and Monod parameters for both species are estimated. Results indicate the inverse method is only slightly sensitive to aquifer heterogeneity and that estimation errors decrease as the sampling time interval decreases with respect to the groundwater travel time between sample locations. Optimum conditions for applying the scalable inverse method in both space and time are investigated under both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifer conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this paper is to present an analytical solution for describing the head distribution in an unconfined aquifer with a single pumping horizontal well parallel to a fully penetrating stream. The Laplace-domain solution is developed by applying Fourier sine, Fourier and Laplace transforms to the governing equation as well as the associated initial and boundary conditions. The time-domain solution is obtained after taking the inverse Laplace transform along with the Bromwich integral method and inverse Fourier and Fourier sine transforms. The upper boundary condition of the aquifer is represented by the free surface equation in which the second-order slope terms are neglected. Based on the solution and Darcy's law, the equation representing the stream depletion rate is then derived. The solution can simulate head distributions in an aquifer infinitely extending in horizontal direction if the well is located far away from the stream. In addition, the solution can also simulate head distributions in confined aquifers if specific yield is set zero. It is shown that the solution can be applied practically to evaluate flow to a horizontal well. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Formation dry-out from CO2 injection into saline aquifers: 2. Analytical
   model for salt precipitation
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIPHASE FLOW; FRACTIONAL FLOW; SIMULATION
AB From a mass balance for water dissolved into the flowing CO2 stream and a consideration of saturation profiles from the Buckley-Leverett fractional flow theory, we derive an equation that directly relates gas saturation S-g,S-d at the dry-out front to temperature, pressure, and salinity dependence of fluid properties. The equation is easily solved by iteration or interpolation. From gas saturation at the front we derive the average gas saturation in the dry-out region, from which we obtain the "solid saturation'' S-S, i.e., the fraction of pore space filled with solid precipitate. Values of S-S derived from this theory show excellent agreement with numerical simulations presented in the preceding companion paper. Thus, from relative permeabilities and fluid properties at in situ conditions prior to CO2 injection, it is possible to directly make an accurate estimate of solids precipitation, without having to perform a numerical simulation of the injection process.

AB We propose streamline-based simulation as a possible alternative to particle tracking for modeling solute transport. Like particle tracking, the pressure field is computed on an underlying grid using conventional techniques. The flow velocity at cell edges is then computed using Darcy's law, and this information is used to trace streamlines throughout the domain. In particle tracking, mass is transported by moving particles along streamlines. In the method we describe, a one-dimensional conservation equation is solved numerically along each streamline. If the flow field changes, the solute concentration is mapped onto the underlying grid and the streamlines are recomputed. The concentration is then mapped back onto the new streamlines, and the simulation proceeds as before. The method is suited for modeling advectively dominated multispecies transport in heterogeneous aquifers. We illustrate the streamline approach with synthetic example problems in fully saturated, confined aquifers: conservative, sorbing, and decaying tracer; a four-component radioactive decay chain; and saltwater intrusion where the flow field changes with time. Where possible, we compare the results with analytical solutions and results from particle tracking codes.

AB A conceptual model for describing effective saturation in fractured hard rock is presented. The fracture network and the rock matrix are considered as an equivalent continuum medium where each fracture is conceptualized as a porous medium of granular structure and the rock matrix is assumed to be impermeable. The proposed model is based oil the representation of a rough-walled fracture by an equivalent porous medium, which is described using classical Constitutive models. A simple closed-form equation for the effective saturation is obtained when the van Genuchten model is used to describe Saturation inside fractures and fractal laws are assumed for both aperture and number of fractures. The relative hydraulic conductivity for the fractured rock is predicted front a simple relation derived by Liu and Bodvarsson. The proposed Constitutive model Contains three independent parameters, which may be obtained by fitting the proposed effective Saturation Curve to experimental data Two of the model parameters have physical meaning and can be identified with the reciprocal of the air entry pressure values in the fractures of minimum and maximum apertures. Effective saturation and relative hydraulic conductivity curves match fairly well the simulated constitutive relations obtained by Liu and Bodvarsson. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID FROZEN PRAIRIE SOILS; INFILTRATION
AB Empirical characteristics of snowmelt runoff are derived from observations made during snowmelt in a six-year period from 1980 to 1985 on three experimental plots and three plates located on the campus of the Lulea University of Technology in Lulea, Sweden. The plots had asphalt, gravel and grass surfaces. The plates were of different designs with one having the bottom cut out so that it was more like a frame. With the assumption that the asphalt surface of the plots was impervious, infiltration of meltwater into gravel and grass surfaces was deduced. Unlike rainfall infiltration, the graph of snowmelt infiltration rate resembled a flow hydrograph, with a distinct rise, a peak and a distinct recession. A strong linear relationship between the snowmelt runoff hydrograph peak and the snowmelt amount was found, which explained more than 90% of the variability in the snowmelt peak. This is in contrast with rainfall runoff where the relationship between runoff peak and volume is decidedly nonlinear. Hourly snowmelt runoff peak and daily snowmelt amount were found to exhibit nearly constant skew and follow approximately a Gumbel frequency distribution. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The skeletal matrix of an aquifer is known to move laterally toward a discharging well.  The mechanisms by which it moves relative to the well have been only partially studied in the past.  Examining the relation of drawdown to volume strain for an assumed poroelastic solid has been a common approach.  By way of contrast, the present study examines the relation of the velocity of solids (aquifer matrix) to their hydraulic driving forces.  The present approach can be considered Darcian and allows the displacement field of the aquifer matrix to be calculated directly.  A new formulation of the Darcy-Gersevanov law of water flowing relative to moving solids is applied to a Theis-Thiem confined aquifer.  The aquifer is found to start with a maximum velocity when the pump is turned on and then to decelerate as time progresses.  Dimensionless type curves of horizontal movement of the skeletal matrix are calculated.  The resulting equation of aquifer deformation is checked against (1) results from alternatively using the standard poroelastic stress-strain approach and (2) the fundamental storage equation for transient groundwater flow.

AB There is a well-established connection among water quality, sanitation, and physical health. The potentially important relationship between water and mental health is considerably less studied. Reviewing evidence from ethnography, geography, folklore, indigenous studies, rural medicine, drought research, and large-n statistical studies, we argue there is now good theoretical rationale and growing evidence of water insecurity as a possible driver of mental ill-health. Furthermore, some nascent evidence suggests that emotionally meaningful interactions with water might improve mental health outcomes. Leveraging these literatures, we address the many ways in which mental health outcomes are conceptualized and operationalized in water research, including as emotional distress, perceived stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms, and quality of life. We outline arguments supporting seven possible (and likely interlocking) mechanisms that could explain such a relationship: (a) material deprivation and related uncertainty, (b) shame of social failure, (c) worry about health threats, (d) loss of connections to people and places, (e) frustration around opportunity losses and restricted autonomy, (f) interpersonal conflict and intimate partner violence, and (g) institutional injustice or unfairness. However, we explain that as most existing studies are ethnographic, qualitative, or cross-sectional, a causal relationship between water and mental ill-health is yet to be confirmed empirically. More research on this topic is needed, particularly given that poorly understood connections may create barriers to achieving Sustainable Development Goals 3 (health) and 6 (water). We further suggest that tracking mental health indicators may provide unique and as-yet underappreciated insights into the efficacy of water projects and other development interventions.

AB The basin area of the Ganges River in Bangladesh is extremely dependent on a regular water supply from upstream to meet requirements for agriculture, fisheries, navigation, salinity control, and domestic and industrial sectors. In 1975, India commissioned a barrage on the Ganges River at Farakka to divert a significant portion of the dry season flow in order to make the Calcutta Port navigable. Statistical analyses of discharge and water level data have been carried out to determine if significant changes have occurred in the hydrology of the Ganges system in Bangladesh in the post-Farakka period. Siltation of the Gorai River (an offtake of the Ganges River) has also been examined using the stage-discharge relationship and regression analysis. The analyses show that the diversion has caused considerable hydrological changes in the Ganges system in Bangladesh. The water supply in the dry season has been reduced substantially, while siltation of the Gorai River has increased significantly.

AB The temporal-spatial resolution of input data-induced uncertainty in a watershed-based water quality model, Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF), is investigated in this study. The temporal resolution-induced uncertainty is described using the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV is found to decrease with decreasing temporal resolution and follow a log-normal relation with time interval for temperature data while it exhibits a power-law relation for rainfall data. The temporal-scale uncertainties in the temperature and rainfall data follow a general extreme value distribution and a Weibull distribution, respectively. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSC) is employed to represent the spatial resolution induced uncertainty. The spatial resolution uncertainty in the dissolved oxygen and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations simulated using HSPF is observed to follow a general extreme value distribution and a log-normal distribution, respectively. The probability density functions (PDF) provide new insights into the effect of temporal-scale and spatial resolution of input data on uncertainties involved in watershed modelling and total maximum daily load calculations. This study exhibits non-symmetric distributions of uncertainty in water quality modelling, which simplify weather and water quality monitoring and reducing the cost involved in flow and water quality monitoring.

TI Sharing water and benefits in transboundary river basins
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCE ALLOCATION; GAME-THEORY; BANKRUPTCY; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK
AB The equitable sharing of benefits in transboundary river basins is necessary to solve disputes among riparian countries and to reach a consensus on basin-wide development and management activities. Benefit-sharing arrangements must be collaboratively developed to be perceived not only as efficient, but also as equitable in order to be considered acceptable to all riparian countries. The current literature mainly describes what is meant by the term benefit sharing in the context of transboundary river basins and discusses this from a conceptual point of view, but falls short of providing practical, institutional arrangements that ensure maximum economic welfare as well as collaboratively developed methods for encouraging the equitable sharing of benefits. In this study, we define an institutional arrangement that distributes welfare in a river basin by maximizing the economic benefits of water use and then sharing these benefits in an equitable manner using a method developed through stakeholder involvement. We describe a methodology in which (i) a hydrological model is used to allocate scarce water resources, in an economically efficient manner, to water users in a transboundary basin, (ii) water users are obliged to pay for water, and (iii) the total of these water charges is equitably redistributed as monetary compensation to users in an amount determined through the application of a sharing method developed by stakeholder input, thus based on a stakeholder vision of fairness, using an axiomatic approach. With the proposed benefit-sharing mechanism, the efficiency-equity trade-off still exists, but the extent of the imbalance is reduced because benefits are maximized and redistributed according to a key that has been collectively agreed upon by the participants. The whole system is overseen by a river basin authority. The methodology is applied to the Eastern Nile River basin as a case study. The described technique not only ensures economic efficiency, but may also lead to more equitable solutions in the sharing of benefits in transboundary river basins because the definition of the sharing rule is not in question, as would be the case if existing methods, such as game theory, were applied, with their inherent definitions of fairness.

AB The theory of travel time and residence time distributions is reworked from the point of view of the hydrological storages and fluxes involved. The forward and backward travel time distribution functions are defined in terms of conditional probabilities. Previous approaches that used fixed travel time distributions are not consistent with our new derivation. We explain Niemi's formula and show how it can be interpreted as an expression of the Bayes theorem. Some connections between this theory and population theory are identified by introducing an expression which connects life expectancy with travel times. The theory can be applied to conservative solutes, including a method of estimating the storage selection functions. An example, based on the Nash hydrograph, illustrates some key aspects of the theory. Generalization to an arbitrary number of reservoirs is presented.

AB We propose three nontraditional dielectric geometries and present an experimental and theoretical analysis and comparison of time domain reflectometry (TDR) performances for them. The traditional geometry (the probes inserted in material of essentially infinite extent) is compared to three nontraditional geometries where the probes are affixed outside of a core sample, inside of a bore, or flat on the surface of a semi-infinite solid. Our derivation relates the velocity of electromagnetic wave propagation to the complex permittivities and permeabilities of the media and the geometry for the three nontraditional configurations. Experimental results for air, styrofoam, dry sand, wet sand of varying water content, nylon, dry wood, and ferromagnetic steel are obtained for the three proposed configurations and are in fair agreement with the literature within the experimental uncertainties. Through experiments and theoretical analysis, the TDR performance is found to be the same within the experimental uncertainties for the three nontraditional geometries. The proposed geometries yield slightly lower sensitivities compared to the traditional geometry. Advantages and disadvantages of the geometries compared to the traditional geometry are also discussed.

AB Both the conventional and the Carlson trophic state index (TSI) classification methods were employed to assess the eutrophication state of 26 lakes in the Norfolk Broads, UK. The parameters employed were: Secchi depth, chlorophyll a and total phosphorous which had been obtained previously by using Landsat TM imagery, ground reference data and empirical algorithms for the Norfolk Broads (Baban, 1993). The conventional method did not provide sufficient differentiation between the Broads. The Carlson TSI provided sufficient information to differentiate between all 26 Broads. Consequently, using the Carlson TSI information, these Broads were classified into three groups. The classification was based on the relationship between the calculated Carlson TSI of the external phosphorous loading and its influence on the eutrophication process as deduced from the calculated TSI values for the other two parameters. The results were consistent with all the available knowledge and experience concerning these Broads and demonstrated the potential of combining remote sensing techniques and Carlson TSI in eutrophication assessment, ecosystem checking and watershed analysis.

AB Modeling of future water systems at the regional scale is a difficult task due to the complexity of current structures (multiple competing water uses, multiple actors, formal and informal rules) both temporally and spatially. Representing this complexity in the modeling process is a challenge that can be addressed by an interdisciplinary and holistic approach. The assessment of the water system of the Crans-Montana-Sierre area (Switzerland) and its evolution until 2050 were tackled by combining glaciological, hydrogeological, and hydrological measurements and modeling with the evaluation of water use through documentary, statistical and interview-based analyses. Four visions of future regional development were co-produced with a group of stakeholders and were then used as a basis for estimating future water demand. The comparison of the available water resource and the water demand at monthly time scale allowed us to conclude that for the four scenarios socioeconomic factors will impact on the future water systems more than climatic factors. An analysis of the sustainability of the current and future water systems based on four visions of regional development allowed us to identify those scenarios that will be more sustainable and that should be adopted by the decision-makers. The results were then presented to the stakeholders through five key messages. The challenges of communicating the results in such a way with stakeholders are discussed at the end of the article.

AB The study based on the interpretation of geochemical (major elements) and isotopic data (O-18, H-2, H-3 and C-14) of the groundwater in the Djerid basin, Southwestern Tunisia, helped to understand the relationships between the different levels of the aquifer system in this basin. It indicates that the slow flowing groundwater of the deep Complex Terminal (CT) aquifer has been recharged under cooler palaeoclimatic conditions. In the present, this groundwater supplies the huge irrigation demands of the oases in the region. The excess irrigation water returns to the ground and recharges the phreatic water table of the Plio-Quaternary aquifer. This water table is not of great quantitative interest; however, it has an important influence in the recharge of the deep CT aquifer. Indeed, the return flow of the evaporated and CO2-equilibrated irrigation water of the phreatic aquifer leads, in some places, to a young bias of radiocarbon ages and a stable isotope enrichment of the deep CT groundwater.

ID HYDROGEOLOGY
AB The Sag aquifer is a Cambro-Ordovician Sandstone Formation that extends over 1200 km in Saudi Arabia and northwards in Jordan. It is an enormous groundwater reservoir where water is found under both unconfined and confined conditions. The main concern of this study was the quality of the Sag aquifer groundwater. This includes a description of the chemical composition of the groundwater, the spatial variation of its salinity and the processes that control this variability. A total of 384 wells drilled in the Sag aquifer were sampled and water analyses performed for the major ionic composition. The data were analysed using software computer programs. Saturation indices were calculated, ionic relationships were studied, hydrochemical facies were determined and water types were identified. The principal processes that control the groundwater quality variations are also discussed. The results of this study provide information needed for groundwater quality management in the Sag aquifer.

ID ACIDIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; DEPOSITION
AB We have used a geographic information system (GIS) to study the relationships between streamwater pH and alkalinity at base flow with geology, soils and relief in 100 forested catchments located in the sandstone portion of the Vosges mountains, where atmospheric deposition and forest cover can be considered homogeneous. At base flow, streamwater acidity depends primarily on bedrock and soil content of weatherable minerals whose dissolution neutralizes acidity. Catchments are developed on three main stratigraphic levels, consisting of two sandstone layers rich in weatherable minerals, called ''rich'', at the upper and lower extremity of the stratigraphic sequence, and a quartzitic sandstone, called ''poor'', in between. Catchments were classified into three major groups in relation to the stratigraphic sequence: (1) only ''poor'' bedrock, (2) ''rich'' upstream and ''poor'' downstream, (3) ''poor'' upstream and ''rich'' downstream. Results showed that streamwater pH differed depending on the group. Within each group, the pH was related to bedrock, soil and relief characteristics of the catchments. The relative surface covered by the bedrock located in the lower part of the catchment explained more than 50% of the variability of pH. More than 20% of variability could be explained by soil types in catchments composed of "poor" bedrock only. Soil type apparently did not influence streamwater pH in the other groups. The catchment area, probably related to the increase of soil volume and water residence time, explained up to 20% of pH variability, depending on the catchment type. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Water conflicts, such as the one in the Everglades, Florida, USA, are complex and dynamic, and there is no theory that yet provides a comprehensive and sufficient explanation for when and how science may be more or less effective. Using both the literature and the water conflict in the Everglades, it is argued that science is most influential in political negotiations when it is created with, not for, stakeholders. The stakeholder negotiators need to know, give feedback on, and eventually vet all stages of the scientific process, which is generating data and possible solutions for them. Such close cooperation is not easy, however. Each group has different goals, jargons, objects to represent phenomena and concepts, and different procedures for working through problems. This paper argues that the political negotiations and technical groups need to jointly create "a common playing field," with a shared purpose supported by a negotiated set of concepts, "boundary objects," and procedures and norms that they use to coordinate their work.

TI TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATIONS OF RUNOFF AND RAINWASH EROSION ON AN
   AGRICULTURAL FIELD
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
DE RUNOFF; EROSION; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; MEASUREMENT; PARAMETER VARIATION
AB This paper investigates the spatial and temporal variations of runoff, erosion and rate of sediment transport on an agricultural field submitted to natural rainfalls. The site, located in the Eastern Townships (Quebec, Canada), is a corn field (10000 m2) where sheetwash erosion is active. Water (Q) and sediment (Qs) discharges were measured from June to October at eight locations on the field and for ten rainfall events. Analysis of the data was carried out on an aggregate data set and on the distributed measurements in time and space. The results showed that changes in vegetation, soil compaction and crusting are critical in determining temporal variations of runoff and erosion. Until August, the increase in soil compaction reduced infiltration capacity and depression storage and generated greater runoff for a given rainfall intensity (I). Sediment transport decreased as particle detachment is less likely to occur when vegetation breaks the drop impact and the soil surface is sealed. Later in the season, we observed an increase in sediment concentration associated with the presence of burrowing insects and harvest activity, providing loose sediments to the broken down surface. Intercepts and slopes of the relationship between Q and Qs also vary during the period of measurement. High sediment availability over the soil surface in June and October gives high intercept values. The slope of the relationship is more stable but difficult to estimate for extreme events (high values of I or low Q values) where the number of sampled points are small. During a rainfall, the response of the field is dominated by the topography and drainage area. The largest amount of runoff and erosion occurred on straight and steep slopes with small drainage areas, and on converging gentle slopes with large drainage areas. Although aggregate runoff and erosion values are decreasing with drainage area, parameters of the Qs-Q relationship for different locations on the field are not statistically different. These results bear important consequences for models of sheetwash erosion on agricultural fields.

AB The rapidly developing practice of encapsulating knowledge in electronic media is shown to lead necessarily to the restructuring of the knowledge itself. The consequences of this for hydraulics, hydrology and more general water-resources management are investigated in particular relation to current process-simulation, real-time control and advice-serving systems. The generic properties of the electronic knowledge encapsulator are described, and attention is drawn to the manner in which knowledge 'goes into hiding' through encapsulation. This property is traced in the simple situations of pure mathesis and in the more complex situations of taxinomia using one example each from hydraulics and hydrology. The consequences for systems architectures are explained, pointing to the need for multi-agent architectures for ecological modelling and for more general hydroinformatics systems also. The relevance of these developments is indicated by reference to ongoing projects in which they are currently being realised. In conclusion, some more general epistemological aspects are considered within the same context. As this contribution is so much concerned with the processes of signification and communication, it has been partly shaped by the theory of semiotics, as popularised by Eco (A Theory of Semiotics, Indiana University, Bloomington, 1977).

AB Effectively managing groundwater relies heavily on estimating the amount of precipitation that may infiltrate the subsurface and supply groundwater. In this study, we present a novel estimation method based on a stochastic approach to evaluate the quantity of precipitation that may recharge groundwater. The precipitation recharge coefficient is also investigated based on an unconfined aquifer with an unbound, infinitely extended boundary condition. Moreover, a spectrum's relationship to the precipitation and groundwater level variation is also derived. The precipitation recharge coefficient can be obtained from the solution of the spectrum equation. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is performed in order to determine the key Variable on the precipitation recharge coefficient. Analysis results indicate that the location of an observation well affects the estimated precipitation recharge coefficient. If the precipitation recharge area is large enough, the precipitation recharge coefficient becomes insensitive to the location of the observation well. The spectrum's relationship between the precipitation recharge and groundwater level variation is also applied when estimating the precipitation recharge coefficient upstream of the Cho-Shui River alluvial fan. According to those results, the precipitation recharge coefficient is 0.03 and the amount of groundwater recharge from precipitation is 35 million tons of water annually upstream of the Cho-Shui River alluvial fan.

ID BRAIDED RIVER; GRAVEL; ENTRAINMENT; SEDIMENTS
AB We carried out a series of measurements to provide data for testing models of downstream fining in an actively braiding gravel bed river, in particular, the model developed in the previous paper. We sampled a series of nine cross sections for bulk grain size distributions over a downstream distance of 5.4 km on the North Fork Toutle River, near Mount St. Helens, Washington. In addition, we sampled two of the nine sections for detailed analysis of surface grain size distributions in the cross-stream direction by Wolman counting within areas of distinct mean grain size (''patches''). Our theory predicts that the rate of downstream fining depends on the distribution of deposition and a relative mobility function that depends on the characteristics of the grain size patches. Application of the theory to the study area shows that most of the observed downstream fining can be explained using patchiness as the dominant mechanism.

ID TRANSPORT
AB The model of soil erosion on a plane slope introduced by Hairsine and Rose (this issue) is further developed by considering rill flow. The rills are considered to be parallel and incised in a homogeneous soil mass and have sediment and water flux contributed to them orthogonally. The erosive action of water flowing down these rills is described using the concept of stream power, which is assumed to be uniformly distributed around the wetted perimeter. The apportioning of the erosion and deposition processes within a rill is then considered to be influenced by the spatial extent of a deposited layer. The theory is developed for trapezoidal rills, with triangular rills and rectangular rills as special cases. Equations describing sediment continuity are presented, and numerical and analytical solutions are described for the entrainment-limited and transport-limited situations. The experiments of Meyer and Harmon (1985) are examined using this theory, and consistency of evaluated parameters is demonstrated within this data set.

AB Competition for water between key economic sectors and the environment means agreeing allocations is challenging. Managing releases from the three major dams in Kenya's Tana River basin with its 4.4 million inhabitants, 567MW of installed hydropower capacity, 33 000 ha of irrigation and ecologically important wetlands and forests is a pertinent example. This research seeks firstly to identify and help decision-makers visualise reservoir management strategies which result in the best possible (Pareto-optimal) allocation of benefits between sectors. Secondly, it seeks to show how trade-offs between achievable benefits shift with the implementation of proposed new rice, cotton and biofuel irrigation projects. To approximate the Pareto-optimal trade-offs we link a water resources management simulation model to a multi-criteria search algorithm. The decisions or "levers" of the management problem are volume-dependent release rules for the three major dams and extent of investment in new irrigation schemes. These decisions are optimised for eight objectives covering the provision of water supply and irrigation, energy generation and maintenance of ecosystem services. Trade-off plots allow decision-makers to assess multi-reservoir rule-sets and irrigation investment options by visualising their impacts on different beneficiaries. Results quantify how economic gains from proposed irrigation schemes trade-off against the disturbance of ecosystems and local livelihoods that depend on them. Full implementation of the proposed schemes is shown to come at a high environmental and social cost. The clarity and comprehensiveness of "best-case" trade-off analysis is a useful vantage point from which to tackle the interdependence and complexity of "water-energy-food nexus" resource security issues.

AB [1] A thermodynamically based model for predicting two-fluid interfacial area (IFA) within a porous medium as a function of wetting phase saturation ( SW) and saturation history is presented. The model considers consistency with multiphase flow constitutive relationships, the conversion of total to effective specific interfacial area, energy losses, and the change of interfacial area as residual nonwetting phase dissolves. The model requires as input only the capillary pressure-saturation relationships and porosity. Published, high-resolution interfacial area-saturation data sets were adequately reproduced when independent measures of these parameters were employed by the model. In particular, the model is found to reproduce key IFA( SW) features including the IFA magnitude and SW value corresponding to the function's maximum, negligible IFA at residual SW and the observed hysteresis of IFA( SW). Varying key model parameters reveals that the magnitude of the IFA( SW) relationship is predicted to be linearly related to the porosity and entry pressure of the porous medium and is unaffected by interfacial tension. Interfacial area is a parameter in the single boundary layer expression of mass transfer between two immiscible liquids in porous media. The model's ability to predict local-scale IFA for a wide variety of fluid-fluid-porous media systems while accounting for saturation and saturation history thus provides an avenue for simulating the dissolution of complex source zones containing both pooled and residual dense nonaqueous phase liquids.

AB [1] Although the Belanger-Boss theorem of critical flow has been widely applied in open channel hydraulics, it was derived from the laws governing ideal frictionless flow. This study explores a more general expression of this theorem and examines its applicability to flow with friction and sediment transport. It demonstrates that the theorem can be more generally presented as the principle of minimum energy (PME), with maximum efficiency of energy use and minimum friction or minimum energy dissipation as its equivalents. Critical flow depth under frictionless conditions, the best hydraulic section where friction is introduced, and the most efficient alluvial channel geometry where both friction and sediment transport apply are all shown to be the products of PME. Because PME in liquids characterizes the stationary state of motion in solid materials, flow tends to rapidly expend excess energy when more than minimally demanded energy is available. This leads to the formation of relatively stable but dynamic energy-consuming meandering and braided channel planforms and explains the existence of various extremal hypotheses.

AB [1] The objective of this work is to determine whether conventional solute macrodispersion theories adequately predict the behavior of individual subsurface plumes over time and length scales relevant to practical risk assessment and remediation activities. This issue is studied with a set of high-resolution numerical simulations of conservative tracers moving through saturated two-dimensional heterogeneous conductivity fields. The simulation experiments are designed to mimic long-term field studies. Spatially correlated statistically stationary lognormal conductivity realizations are generated with a Fourier transform procedure. Steady state velocity solutions are calculated for these fields using an accurate Darcian solver. Velocity contour plots reveal the presence of disconnected networks of preferential pathways over a range of correlation lengths. Reverse flow cells are rare. The velocity probability density functions have exponential tails and strong longitudinal asymmetries. Solute concentrations are derived from the simulated velocity fields with an accurate taut-spline transport code that minimizes numerical dispersion. The resulting plumes are tracked for travel distances of over one hundred spatial correlation lengths, corresponding to scales of practical interest. First moments and macrodispersivities, which measure the location and extent of the plume, are reasonably well approximated by conventional Fickian theories but continue to vary after long travel distances. This temporal variability highlights the slow convergence of the plume moments to Gaussian limits. Calculations of the relative dilution index, which is a measure of the plume mixing state, indicate strongly non-Gaussian behavior. Other measures of plume structure suggested by anomalous dispersion theories also reveal the persistence of non-Gaussian behavior after long travel distances. These measures appear to be more sensitive to non-Gaussian behavior than the spatial moments. Taken together, the simulation results suggest that conservative solute plumes moving through statistically stationary random media may not converge to Gaussian limits even after traveling hundreds of log conductivity correlation scales.

AB Experiments on the immiscible displacement of water by air were performed in two horizontal artificial open rough-walled fractures with different correlation structures. The aperture field of the first fracture has a Gaussian variogram with a finite correlation length, while that of the second one has a power-law variogram, for which no finite correlation length can be assigned. We simulated the displacement process using an invasion percolation model, which takes the in-plane curvature of the interface between water and air into account. The correlation structure of the aperture field has no effect on the irregularity of the shape of the air clusters. However, the correlation structure in combination with the in-plane curvature influences the density of the air clusters and thus has an impact on characteristic properties of the flow. We analyze the model parameters and properties with respect to the fracture properties. The stochastic average of the air clusters for models with different curvature numbers and fields with different correlation lengths is then calculated in order to analyze their influence on continuum approach models.

ID CATCHMENTS; YIELD
AB Wildfire alters the hydrologic response of watersheds, including the peak discharges resulting from subsequent rainfall, Improving predictions of the magnitude of flooding that follows wildfire is needed because of the increase in human population at risk in the wildland-urban interface. Because this wildland-urban interface is typically in mountainous terrain, we investigated rainfall-runoff relations by measuring the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity and the unit-area peak discharge (peak discharge divided by the area burned) in three mountainous watersheds (17-26.8 km(2)) after a wildfire.
   We found rainfall-runoff relations that relate the unit-area peak discharges to the maximum 30 min rainfall intensities by a power law. These rainfall-runoff relations appear to have a threshold value for the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity (around 10 mm h(-1)) such that, above this threshold, the magnitude of the flood peaks increases more rapidly with increases in intensity. This rainfall intensity could be used to set threshold limits in rain gauges that are part of an early-warning flood system after wildfire. The maximum unit-area peak discharges from these three burned watersheds ranged from 3.2 to 50 m(3) s(-1) km(-2). These values could provide initial estimates of the upper limits of runoff that can be used to predict floods after wildfires in mountainous terrain. Published in 2001 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The whole of a basin responds to a precipitation event. The resulting flood wave introduces a complex pattern of interrelated processes which occur in the vegetation, soil, bedrock, human facilities, channel and in the different parts of the basin. The main advantage of field experiments is that it becomes possible to exclude several governing factors or sources and to control others by the experimental design. In a small brook near Trier (Germany), artificial flood events are created. In-channel transport processes of sediment are investigated without taking into account the interference of soil erosion and runoff. It is demonstrated that kinematic waves-describing the translation of flow with limited hydraulic dispersion or diffusion-also occur in small basins. The kinematic waves-travelling only a few hundred meters - have a large impact on the relationship between the hydrograph and dissolved or particle-bound substances. Consequently, classifications and simple mixing models between those components are impeded.

ID MODELS
AB A rainstorm that caused a severe flash flood on the piedmont plain at the toe positions of two alluvial fans located to the west of the Organ Mountains in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, USA, is analysed. The space-time distributions of rainfall are evaluated from the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) and overland flow is modelled as kinematic wave. The spatial distribution of rainfall shows a topographic control. The greatest rainfall depth, duration, and intensity occurred at the higher elevation mountain slopes and decreased with decreasing elevation from the alluvial fans to the piedmont plain. The alluvial fan-piedmont plain system is modelled by coupling divergent and rectangular overland flow planes. Explicit finite difference approximations, hybridized with the analytical method of characteristics, are made to the kinematic wave equations to account for the spatial and temporal distribution of the rainfall and variable boundary conditions. Simulation results indicate that sheet-flow floodwater elevations rise (1) in a nonlinear fashion from the apex to toe positions of the alluvial fans, and (2) near linearly from the toe positions of the alluvial fans onto the piedmont plains with the formation of kinematic shocks near the middle to the upstream end of the plane at times between the initiation of the rainstorm and the time of concentration of the plane. Thus, the maximum flooding occurs at the middle or upstream sections of the piedmont plains regardless of the pattern of space-time variability of rainfall. These results are in agreement with observed geomorphologic features suggesting that piedmont plains are naturally flood-prone areas. This case study demonstrates that flood hazards on piedmont plains can exceed those on alluvial fans. The models presented in this study suggest that the flood hazard zones on coupled alluvial fan-piedmont plain landforms should be delineated transverse to the flow directions, as opposed to the flood hazard zones with boundaries in the longitudinal direction of the axis of an alluvial fan.

AB The presence and flux of biogenic methane-rich free phase gas that is eventually released to the atmosphere influence water content (theta) of peat soils below the water table. Small variations in gas content in peat soils at near-saturation theta could be inferred by changes in dielectric permittivity, but detailed measurements in that range of theta needed to develop calibration functions are lacking. Our experiment uses a new method for varying theta in the sample using elevated pressure to reduce the naturally occurring volumetric gas content in a manner similar to what occurs in situ under atmospheric pressure change, which relevant to understanding carbon gas cycling in peatlands. We recorded dielectric permittivity using a 1.6 MHz ground-penetrating radar antenna at multiple water contents between 0.87 and 0.95 m(3) m(-3) on four peat monoliths with varying levels of humification and with <5% gas content as is commonly observed in the field. We identified empirical equations that were linear over the range of theta investigated and optimized a dielectric mixing model for estimating theta from GPR. These results indicate that there are differences in the permittivity-theta relationships developed between peat samples and suggest that variability in dielectric relationships may be attributed to peat structure and particle orientation. The empirical relationships developed in this study confirm the utility of previously applied multiphase mixing models for estimating peat properties using methods sensitive to dielectric permittivity. This work is relevant to studies of gas content in peat and the role of peatlands in the carbon cycle.

AB In this paper large-scale dispersion coefficients for tracer transport in a radially diverging flow field with cylindrical geometry in an unbounded domain are investigated. The effect of small-scale dispersion as well as small-scale diffusion on the large-scale dispersion is analyzed. Macrodispersion coefficients are derived analytically from ensemble-averaged second radial cumulants of the tracer concentration distribution. The cumulants are calculated to second order in the fluctuations of permeability of the heterogeneous porous medium. A macrodispersion coefficient is found, which is proportional to the mean velocity field. It is shown that the macrodispersivity is modified because of the impact of the small-scale diffusion and small-scale dispersion. The vertical small-scale mixing leads to a decrease of the macrodispersivity. Small-scale diffusion makes this decrease time-dependent. Horizontal diffusion, however, leads to an increase of the macrodispersivity.

   FORMULATION; RESERVOIRS
AB [1] The governing equations for a fully coupled analysis of two-phase fluid flow through fractured porous media with deformable matrix are presented. Two porosities, three constitutes (one solid and two fluids), and five phases are identified. The porosities are referred to as pores and fractures, and the two fluid constitutes are taken as water and air. The governing equations are derived using a systematic macroscopic approach based on the theory of poroelasticity, the effective stress principle, and the balance equations of mass and momentum. Matrix displacement vector, pore air pressure, pore water pressure, fracture air pressure and fracture water pressure are introduced as primary variables. Special attention is given to cross- coupling effects between the phases within the system. A general formulation is derived that reduces to all previously presented models in the field. When the pore air volume is reduced to zero, the fully coupled equations of flow and deformation for saturated double-porosity media are recovered. Similarly, when the matrix deformation is neglected and full saturation is assumed, Barenblatt et al.' s (1960) classical theory of double porosity is obtained.

TI PERMEABILITY MEASUREMENTS ON NEW AND EQUITEMPERATURE SNOW
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DRY SNOW; CONVECTION; AIR
AB Measurements of the air permeability were performed on snow from six horizons within a snowpack at the Glacier Lakes Ecosystems Experiment Site in southeastern Wyoming. The snow was new or equitemperature snow, with densities (rho(s)) ranging between 0.134 and 0.367 Mg m-3. The specific surface area of ice in each sample was measured stereologically. Intrinsic permeabilities (K0) calculated from these data ranged from 3.0 x 10(-10) to 3.1 x 10(-9) m2. The data fitted the equation K0 = 1.096 x 10(-8)e9.57rho(s), with a standard deviation of 2.8 x 10(-10) m2 . A dimensionally correct relationship between permeability and specific surface area did not fit our data as well as a simple density relationship. The small scatter reported is attributed to careful selection of undamaged samples and the prevention of sample sublimation during the measurements.

AB [1] Cross-stratified deposits can give rise to a hierarchy of permeability modes, across scales, corresponding to a hierarchy of sedimentary unit types. The shape of the sample semivariogram for permeability can be largely controlled by the shape of the cross-transition probabilities of unit types having the greatest contrast in permeability. The shape of those cross-transition probabilities can be, in turn, largely determined by the variance of the lengths of those unit types. A sufficient condition for an exponential-like semivariogram is the repeated occurrence of unit types having both a contrast in permeability and a large length variance. These relationships are shown through writing the identities for spatial correlation of permeability in a hierarchical and multimodal form and as a function of the transition probabilities for the sedimentary unit types. These relationships are also illustrated through analyzing data representing cross-stratified sediments within a point bar deposit.

AB An understanding of the scaling proper-ties of precipitation and landforms (hillslopes, channel network) is, on its own, of theoretical and predictive significance. However, it is also expected that it should lead to the development of a physically meaningful flood scaling theory. The objective of this study is to identify catchment geomorphological scaling descriptors useful in establishing a criterion for similarity in regional flood behaviour. The focus is on the channel network. The nature of the scaling structure of the channel network width function is investigated. An attempt is made to determine the strength of the association between the scaling structure of the width function and at-site flood peaks. For catchments with drainage area greater than 200 km(2), located east of Melbourne and the Great Dividing Range, this work established an association between the Levy index of the generators of the cascade structure of the width function and at-site flood behaviour. It is further suggested that such an index will be a useful candidate in the development of a criterion, which predicts similarity in regional flood behaviour.

AB Violence over water resources has persisted in various forms for thousands of years, driven by complex ideological, religious, economic, and strategic factors. Scarce and valuable freshwater has played a role in conflicts as a contributing factor, a target or tool, or a weapon. The focus of this review is on specific instances of violence around water and water systems conflict in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen, where water resources and human-built water systems have been both weapons and targets of conflict. A new cycle of violence in the region, growing in extent and severity, began approximately three decades ago and is described here in the context of broader regional water challenges and theoretical issues around environmental security. New data and definitions and an analysis of the types of event and sources of information are also provided in the context of international humanitarian law. This assessment confirms and expands upon previous work that evaluates trends toward the weaponization of water and the targeting of water systems in Middle East conflicts. Initial recommendations for reducing these trends are provided. This article is categorized under: Human Water > Water Governance Human Water > Rights to Water Science of Water > Water Quality

AB Traditionally, the estimation of Mean Flow (MF) in ungauged catchments has been approached using conceptual water balance models or empirical formulae relating climatic inputs to stream flow. In the UK, these types of models have difficulty in predicting MF in low rainfall areas because the conceptualisation of soil moisture behaviour and its relationship with evaporation rates used is rather simplistic. However, it is in these dry regions where the accurate estimation of flows is most critical to effective management of a scarce resource. A novel approach to estimating W, specifically designed to improve estimation of runoff in dry catchments, has been developed using a regionalisation of the Penman drying curve theory. The dynamic water balance style Daily Soil Moisture Accounting (DSMA) model operates at a daily time step, using inputs of precipitation and potential evaporation and simulates the development of soil moisture deficits explicitly. The model has been calibrated using measured MFs from a large data set of catchments in the United Kingdom. The performance of the DSMA model is superior to existing established steady state and dynamic water-balance models over the entire data set considered and the largest improvement is observed in very low rainfall catchments. It is concluded that the performance of all models in high rainfall areas is likely to be limited by the spatial representation of rainfall.

TI Prediction of discharge from water surface width in a braided river with

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DIGITAL PHOTOGRAMMETRY; STREAM; IMAGERY
AB [1] The total discharge of small braided rivers can be monitored nearly continuously using ground-based, orthorectified oblique images and a locally derived relationship between mean water surface width in a reach and total discharge with accuracy of the order of 10%. The width-discharge relationship is nearly linear over the normal range of summer flows measured in this proglacial stream. The width-discharge relation for a given location and channel configuration is transferable to adjacent reaches with different morphology with little loss in accuracy. However, the prospect of a more universal relation for braided rivers is remote because of differences in channel geometry and hydraulics between rivers. The classical at-a-station hydraulic geometry exponent for width in this case is approximately 1.05, which is unique, well above that observed in the few other braided rivers for which this has been derived, and implies almost no change in mean velocity and depth with changing stage.

TI Hydrology and beyond: the scientific work of August Colding revisited
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB August Colding was one of the three pioneers who in the mid-1800s almost simultaneously and independently formulated the first law of thermodynamics, the two others being Robert Mayer and James Joule. This first, significant achievement was followed by a sequence of other ground-breaking discoveries within a broad range of disciplines: magnetism, steam power, gas production, hydraulics, soil physics, hydrology, heating and ventilation, meteorology, and oceanography. Moreover, he made a significant contribution to the understanding of the spread of cholera. In hydrology, he used evaporation experiments to obtain water balances. Independently, he formulated Darcy's law and was the first to calculate the water table between drainpipes and the piezometric surface in confined aquifers. His main occupation, however, was chief engineer in Copenhagen, where he modernized the city by introducing groundwater-based water supply and building a waterworks delivering pressured, clean water into houses, a gasworks and gas-based street lighting, and a citywide sewage system. Colding has not been as recognized internationally as he might deserve, probably because most of his publications were written in Danish. Even in Denmark, he seems today almost forgotten. This paper highlights his most important scientific contributions, in particular his achievements in hydrology, hydraulics, meteorology, and oceanography.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

AB The Chezy formula for steady flow in a uniform symmetrical channel with constant slope-friction factor is mathematically examined. The problem of the determination of the channel shape above a reference level for a given rating curve of flow area vs discharge with a constant ratio (m) of slope to mean velocity above a reference level is posed and then solved. It is shown that there is a double solution of the problem. One solution (being of main interest) is unlimited and gives a shape widening with depth, while the other has an upper bound and yields a shape narrow-ing with depth. It is shown that a solution to the problem exists for a negative value of m. A relationship is examined between the width-to-depth ratio of a rectangular initial shape and a shape above a reference level for m values close to zero. In particular, the solutions for negative values of m, i.e. for discharge decreasing with increasing flow area, are evidently against common sense.

AB Spatial variability of both long and short term rainfall in an urban environment in Malaysia was studied using historical monthly and yearly rainfall data and, unique for the humid tropics region, recently collected, short term rainfall data measured with very small time and space resolution. The results for the yearly data indicated some elongation of the spatial structures of rainfall in the area. The monthly rainfall data showed that the geographical orientation of these structures for the months of December to March was different from that during April to November. These differences were due to the effects caused by monsoon seasonality and by the influence of the sea. The spatial structure and depth-area relationship for short term thunderstorms have been derived. The basic statistics of point observations were also studied. The results showed that the spatial variability of short term rainfall was more significant for short term rainfall than for the long term behaviour. Thus, the spatial structure of short term rainfall should be considered as important in urban runoff calculations.

TI Encounters with the moral economy of water: convergent evolution in
   Valencia
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
LA English
DT Review
AB This article presents the results of comparative fieldwork on the huerta of Valencia in Spain, a successful community-managed irrigation system of medium scale, one governed collectively by thousands of small farmers organized into 10 autonomous but highly interdependent irrigator groups. The study tested a model identified previously in research on successful systems of much smaller scale in Peru, a set of principles of operation that, when affirmed by farmers and obeyed as collective-choice rules, interact to create equity among water rights and transparency in water use in an unusual way. The authors show that a nearly identical set are at work in all 10 communities of Valencia, revealing the unique manner in which these work together to promote successful and sustainable cooperation, both within and between the user groups, and arguing that their presence in Spain and the Andes is indicative, not of diffusion from one continent to another, but of independent invention. These principles together laid the foundations for separate Andean and Islamic hydraulic traditions, which were often manifested locally in robust and equitable systems of the same general type, here called the moral economy of water. This kind of communal system appears to have emerged repeatedly, and often independently, in a great many other locales and settings throughout the world; its adaptive dynamics are shown to be of great relevance to small farmers today as they face the growing scarcity of water being induced by population growth and by climate change.

AB Fisheries managers have often suggested that survival of trout during the winter is a major factor affecting population densities in many stream ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains. In Wyoming, trout population reductions from fall to spring in excess of 90% have been documented in some reservoir tailwaters. Though biologists have surmised that these reductions were the result of either mortality or emigration from some river sections, the specific mechanisms have not been defined and the factors leading to the trout loss are unknown. This is a review of four studies that were conducted or funded between 1991 and 1998 by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to understand the extent of overwinter losses, identify some of the mechanisms leading to those conditions and develop management strategies to help avoid those impacts. Winter studies were conducted on tailwater fisheries in the Green, North Platte, Bighorn and Shoshone rivers to document trout population dynamics, assess physical habitat availability, evaluate trout movement and habitat selection, and understand the relationships between food availability and bioenergetic relationships. Results indicate that winter trout losses are extreme in some years, that trout movement and habitat selection are affected by supercooled flows, and that mortality is probably not directly due to starvation. The combination of physiological impairment with frequently altered habitat availability probably leads to indirect mortality from predators and other factors.

SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
DE boreal forest; snowmelt; canopy density; remote sensing; scaling
ID LEAF-AREA INDEX; BALANCE; COVER
AB Spatial variation in snowmelt rates in the boreal forest can be explained by differences in canopy density. Canopy density, represented as gap fractions (GF), controls both the amount of short-wave radiation reaching the snowpack surface and wind speed over the snow surface, which in turn regulates sensible and latent heat fluxes, Reductions in shortwave, sensible and latent heat fluxes outweigh any increased contributions from longwave radiation from the canopy. Differences in the total energy available for melt do not translate to equally proportional changes in melt rates under different canopy densities. As available energy increases, the melt rate increases with decreasing canopy density and the form of the relationship can vary depending on climatic conditions. A good relationship between ground-based GF measurements and a canopy closure index derived from Landsat TM provides the spatial fabric for the distribution of snowmelt rates that show comparable patterns of snow ablation during years of very different climatological conditions. This physically meaningful method of determining the spatial variability of snow ablation and subsequent meltwater delivery to the soil interface is particularly useful for providing insight to the heterogeneous active layer development in permafrost regions of the boreal forest and the implications for runoff processes.

AB Event-based runoff coefficients can provide information on watershed response. They are useful for catchment comparison to understand how different landscapes "filter" rainfall into event-based runoff and to explain the observed differences with catchment characteristics and related runoff mechanisms. However, the big drawback of this important parameter is the lack of a standard hydrograph separation method preceding its calculation. Event-based runoff coefficients determined with four well-established separation methods, as well as a newly developed separation method, are compared and PF are shown to differ considerably. This signifies that runoff coefficients reported in the literature often convey less information than required to allow for catchment classification. The new separation technique (constant-k method) is based on the theory of linear storage. Its advantages are that it is theoretically based in determining the end point of an event and that it can also be applied to events with multiple peaks. Furthermore, it is shown that event-based runoff coefficients in combination with simple statistical models improve our understanding of rainfall-runoff response of catchments with sparse data.

ID DRAINAGE BASINS; RIVER PROFILES; DENUDATION; EROSION; RELIEF; WORLD;

AB The ability to understand and predict the flux and fate of sediment delivered to the sea by rivers remains an outstanding scientific challenge. Approaches to this challenge are necessarily synthetic, spanning wide ranges in spatial and temporal scales. Here a conventional sediment transport theory used by engineers and sedimentologists at reach and channel scales is applied at the basin scale. Specifically, a straightforward expression proposed by Bagnold and modified accordingly predicts the observed importance of combined wetness and steepness of a source basin as a control of sediment supply to the sea. The reasonable, key assumption underlying the application of sediment transport theory in this context is that the river-mouth sites for which suspended-sediment loads are reported are alluviated, and thus characterized by transport-limited flux of sediment. This analysis also indicates the potential significance of additional, as yet poorly documented factors constraining sediment supply to the sea. These factors, some of which appear to covary systematically with climate, include river-profile concavity, river-mouth channel width and friction, and the characteristic size of sediment in transport.

AB A new Bayesian method is developed to identify the spatial distribution of permeabilities. In addition to sparsely sampled permeability and pressure data, this approach incorporates densely sampled seismic velocity data along with semiempirical relationships between seismic and hydraulic soil properties. The procedure consists first of performing a hydrological inversion based solely on the permeability and pressure data. In light of the available seismic data, the velocity-permeability-pressure relationships are then used to update, in a Bayesian sense, the image of the permeability field. To investigate the usefulness of this approach, synthetic case studies are performed. These studies demonstrate that, even when the seismic data are corrupted by a significant level of error, a joint geophysical-hydrological inversion can produce improved images of permeability. Moreover, this paper derives rigorously the bounds on the error that can be tolerated in seismic velocities such that they are still useful for hydrological purposes.

AB We propose an approach to spatial modeling of extreme rainfall, based on max-stable processes fitted using partial duration series and a censored threshold likelihood function. The resulting models are coherent with classical extreme-value theory and allow the consistent treatment of spatial dependence of rainfall using ideas related to those of classical geostatistics. We illustrate the ideas through data from the Val Ferret watershed in the Swiss Alps, based on daily cumulative rainfall totals recorded at 24 stations for four summers, augmented by a longer series from nearby. We compare the fits of different statistical models appropriate for spatial extremes, select that best fitting our data, and compare return level estimates for the total daily rainfall over the stations. The method can be used in other situations to produce simulations needed for hydrological models, and in particular, for the generation of spatially heterogeneous extreme rainfall fields over catchments.

AB A new method is presented for identification of the permeability distribution in near-surface aquifers.  In addition to using the usual sparsely sampled pressure and permeability data, the method incorporates densely sampled seismic data, as obtained from a reflection or tomography survey, along with empirical relationships between seismic and hydraulic properties.  The procedure is to first estimate by hydrologic inversion a pressure field.  Then the velocity-permeability-pressure relationship is used to map the inverted pressure and measured seismic data to multivalued estimates of the permeability.  Of those, the most probable value, based on the hydrologic inversion, is selected.  In synthetic case studies the tremendous increase in coverage offered by the seismic data leads to dramatically better results in terms of both accuracy and resolution.  An appealing feature is the use of relatively easy to acquire pressure data; a second is the incorporation of geophysical data which can sample an entire aquifer remotely without the need for an expensive and invasive drilling program.

AB Satellite remote sensing can be used to investigate spatially distributed hydrological states for use in modeling, assessment, and management. However, in the visual wavelengths, cloud cover can often obscure significant portions of the images. This study develops a rule-based, multistep method for removing clouds from MODIS snow cover area (SCA) images. The methods used include combining images from more than one satellite, time interpolation, spatial interpolation, and estimation of the probability of snow occurrence based on topographic information. Applied over the upper Salt River basin in Arizona, the method reduced the degree of cloud obscuration by 93.8 %, while maintaining a similar degree of image accuracy to that of the original images.

TI ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLOOD PEAKS AND FLOOD VOLUMES
   BASED ON CROSSING PROPERTIES OF RIVER FLOW PROCESSES
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A stochastic approach is developed for the determination of the reduction ratio between the annual maximum flow averaged over a consecutive D hour period and the annual maximum of peak instantaneous flow with the same frequency of occurrence. Initially, crossing properties of the integrated flow process are related to those of the instantaneous flows, using a Gaussian hypothesis. The scale of fluctuation of the river flow process is the key parameter which governs the theoretical reduction function. Application is made to numerous historical series from Italy. To facilitate the applicability of the model, a method of calibration based on currently available hydrometric information is proposed. Quantiles of flood volumes are obtained from the theoretical reduction function. It is verified that the reduction ratio is independent of the return period and appears to be insensitive to the underlying distributions of the component processes. The non-Gaussian case and scaling properties are discussed.

TI Finite element methods for modeling water flow in variably saturated
   porous media: Numerical oscillation and mass-distributed schemes
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID UNSATURATED FLOW; EQUATION
AB The finite element method is an attractive numerical method for modeling water flow in variably saturated porous media due to its flexibility in dealing with complicated geometries. It is well known that the conventional mass-distributed finite element method suffers from numerical oscillations at the wetting front, especially for very dry initial conditions. Routinely, mass-lumped procedures are used to eliminate them. This paper proposes a physical interpretation of the finite element method applied to the water flow problem. With the finite element method, mass conservation is applied at the element level. The water storage and the flux within each element are split into several components in the function space, each of which corresponds to one component of the boundary flux of the element. However, even though physical laws are correctly applied at the element level, it is shown that the traditional mass-distributed scheme can still generate an incorrect neighboring node response due to the highly nonlinear properties of water flow in unsaturated soil and cause numerical oscillation. We propose two new mass-distributed schemes which are free of the numerical oscillation, and reduce the smearing near the wetting front, at slightly increased CPU time.

   VISCOSITY; DISPLACEMENTS; MACRODISPERSION
AB The results of a series of high-resolution numerical experiments are used to test and compare three nonlinear models for high-concentration-gradient dispersion. Gravity stable miscible displacement is considered. The first model, introduced by Hassanizadeh, is a modification of Fick's law which involves a second-order term in the dispersive flux equation and an additional dispersion parameter beta. The numerical experiments confirm the dependency of beta on the flow rate. In addition, a dependency on travelled distance is observed. The model can successfully be applied to nearly homogeneous media (sigma(2) = 0.1), but additional fitting is required for more heterogeneous media.
   The second and third models are based on homogenization of the local scale equations describing density-dependent transport. Egorov considers media that are heterogeneous on the Darcy scale, whereas Demidov starts at the pore-scale level. Both approaches result in a macroscopic balance equation in which the dispersion coefficient is a function of the dimensionless density gradient. In addition, an expression for the concentration variance is derived. For small sigma(2), Egorov's model predictions are in satisfactory agreement with the numerical experiments without the introduction of any new parameters. Demidov's model involves an additional fitting parameter, but can be applied to more heterogeneous media as well.

AB Anisotropy in large-scale unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of layered soils changes with the moisture state. Here, state-dependent anisotropy is computed under conditions of large-scale gravity drainage. Soils represented by Gardner's exponential function are perfectly stratified, periodic, and inclined. Analytical integration of Darcy's law across each layer results in a system of nonlinear equations that is solved iteratively for capillary suction at layer interfaces and for the Darcy flux normal to layering. Computed fluxes and suction profiles are used to determine both upscaled hydraulic conductivity in the principal directions and the corresponding ''state-dependent'' anisotropy ratio as functions of the mean suction. Three groups of layered soils are analyzed and compared with independent predictions from the stochastic results of Yeh et al. (1985b). The small-perturbation approach predicts appropriate behaviors for anisotropy under nonarid conditions. However, the stochastic results are limited to moderate values of mean suction; this limitation is linked to a Taylor series approximation in terms of a group of statistical and geometric parameters. Two alternative forms of the Taylor series provide upper and lower bounds for the state-dependent anisotropy of relatively dry soils.

ID SOIL RESPONSE; BED
AB The action of water waves moving over a porous seabed drives a seepage flux into and out of the marine sediments. The volume of fluid exchange per wave cycle may affect the rate of contaminant transport in the sediments. In this paper, the dynamic response of the seabed to ocean waves is treated analytically on the basis of pore-elastic theory applied to a porous seabed. The seabed is modelled as a semi-infinite, isotropic, homogeneous material. Most previous investigations on the wave-seabed interaction problem have assumed quasi-static conditions within the seabed, although dynamic behaviour often occurs in natural environments. Furthermore, wave pressures used in the previous approaches were obtained from conventional ocean wave theories: which are based on the assumption of an impermeable rigid seabed. By introducing a complex wave number, we derive a new wave dispersion equation, which includes the seabed characteristics (such as soil permeability, shear modulus, etc.). Based on the new closed-form analytical solution, the relative differences of the wave-induced seabed response under dynamic and quasi-static conditions are examined. The effects of wave and soil parameters on the seepage flux per wave cycle are also discussed in detail. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This is a comparison between the evaporative fraction EF, which is the surface latent heat flux divided by the available energy, and the Priestley-Taylor parameter alpha. It is shown for the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) that the hypothesis that the midday values of EF and a: are the same as their daytime average values must be rejected at the 0.05 level of significance. However, correlations are high between the midday and daytime average values for both variables. Daytime average latent heat fluxes were estimated based on midday values of EF and alpha along with daytime average available energy and equilibrium evaporation. In addition, the relationships between soil moisture and the midday and daytime average values of EF and alpha were considered, along with the utility of these relationships in determining daytime total evaporation. The conclusion is that at FIFE formulations based on EF are essentially interchangeable with corresponding formulations based on alpha.

AB In this study, a Bayesian Network (BN) is used to model the suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the catchments of the glaciers Noir and Blanc in the Ecrins National Park, France, and at the distal end of the proglacial zone into which both torrents drain. Relationships between air temperature, glacier discharge and SSC are represented as random variables; thereby taking the natural next step from proposed modified rating Curve methods which increasingly approximate random variable approaches. Hydrological relationships are propagated through the network via conditional probability distributions computed from 980 field records obtained at three monitoring sites during July 2005. Rainfall affected data are removed from the modelling process. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit (two-sample KS) test (n = 5) shows good agreement between the probability distributions of SSC predicted by the BN, and those recorded in the field at the outflow of the proglacial zone over an air temperature range of 5-25 degrees C. The BN performs poorly for air temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees C and this is attributed to limited field records covering this temperature range. Discussion of the significant limitations surrounding the widespread application of BNs in hydrological modelling are offered with a focus on data volume and temporal limitations.

AB The American Southwest is a dryland region with variable, seasonal precipitation, and a wide range of freshwater habitats. Amphibians are among the diverse freshwater taxa that rely on aquatic habitats of the southwest, yet the state-of-the-science regarding vulnerability of the region's amphibians to threats recognized globally is unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we reviewed 81 publications and 341 species:threat relationships to assess coverage in the peer-reviewed literature of potential threats to 35 amphibians native to the region. We classified threats into three major categories: climate change, biological, and land use. Using a new trait database for anurans (frogs and toads) of the United States, we evaluated these threats in the context of life history diversity of the region's anurans. We found high coverage for hydrological alteration and introduced species as well as changes to community dynamics, land use, and precipitation. Other potential threats-particularly those linked to climate change such as changes in seasonality and fire-had comparatively low coverage. Coverage varied widely among species, with the number of reported species:threat relationships ranging from 37 (the lowland leopard frog, Lithobates yavapaiensis) to no coverage for some species-including some of conservation concern (e.g., Sacramento Mountains salamander, Aneides hardii). Our findings support leveraging available information to test hypothesized linkages between amphibian life histories and risk and response to threats; using high coverage species and threats to inform simulations and experiments exploring species:threat relationships and efficacy of management strategies; and addressing knowledge gaps for species and threats with no proxies through on-the-ground natural history efforts.

TI Prediction of watershed runoff using Bayesian concepts and modular
   neural networks
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Artificial neural networks have been widely used as models for a variety of nonlinear hydrologic processes including that of predicting runoff over a watershed. In this paper such networks were organized in a modular architecture to handle complex sets of rainfall-runoff data. Such data often contain examples corresponding to different rules that may be associated with high, low, and medium streamflows. Different modules within the network were trained to learn subsets of the input space in an expert fashion. A gating network was used to mediate the response of all the experts. The problem was posed as one of Bayesian statistics combined with maximum likelihood estimation of network parameters. The training of the gating network was equivalent to the classification problem (i.e., identification of the expert), while the experts trained to minimize the absolute difference between predicted and target monthly discharges. The performance of modular networks in predicting runoff over three medium-sized watersheds was examined. Average monthly rainfall of current and previous months and average monthly temperatures were treated as network inputs, and monthly runoff was treated as output. Three different modular network architectures were examined in this payer: two based on hard classification and one based on soft classification. In addition, a fully connected feed forward network was utilized for comparison purposes. On the basis of the results, modular networks appear to be good alternatives for predicting runoff. The role of these networks on issues regarding probabilistic interpretability and classification are discussed.

AB The functional relationships between soil hydraulic properties (K, theta and psi) are needed for analyzing unsaturated water flow in soils and are generally of a nonlinear form. These relationships, estimated from field-measured data, usually show large variability because of measurement errors and natural spatial heterogeneity exhibited by many field soils. A probabilistic approach is often employed to account for this uncertainty in parameters whereby the coefficients in the resulting partial differential equation are treated as random quantities (usually characterized by their moments). The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the errors resulting when simplified solutions based on simple forms of the hydraulic properties are used rather than nonlinear and numerically complicated models. As an example of a parametric functional relationship for K-theta-psi, we adopt the Brooks-Corey formulation in which a single parameter A is considered as random to emulate the spread encountered in practice. For data that show a large enough spread and when one is interested in the mean behavior of K, theta or psi, simple flow models such as the Green-Ampt model and the linear model are proposed as alternatives to the more accurate (but numerically demanding) Richards' equation. To compare models, scaled error definitions are introduced and are expressed as a percentage of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil. These time dependent errors are then computed under various boundary conditions. In general, the Green-Ampt solution is found to yield smaller errors than the linear model when compared with solutions from Richards' equation. It is concluded that the use of simplified models is justified when field data exhibit sufficient spread. and a tight bound cannot be placed on the parameter estimates.

AB We develop two mathematical models for coupled solute transport and nonlinear adsorption to geologic media. Both models quantify nonuniformity in mass transfer rates with parameters that vary according to a gamma (gamma) probability density function. The multisite model, which describes surface-reaction controls on adsorption kinetics, solves equations for a second-order rate law. The adsorption rate coefficient of the kinetics equation is correlated with a gamma-distributed desorption rate coefficient. The mobile-immobile model is based on the assumption that rate limitations are diffusion controlled and account for a gamma distribution in solute exchange rates between zones of mobile and immobile water. Solute adsorption in the immobile zone is quantified with the nonlinear expression for the Langmuir equilibrium isotherm. We test the models against results of column experiments on the transport of hydroxyatrazine (HA), a persistent contaminant produced from the degradation of atrazine. We find that the experimental data are matched more closely by calculations of the multisite model than by calculations of the mobile-immobile model, suggesting that HA adsorption can be understood best as a kinetics reaction with a solid phase composed of binding sites with a broad distribution in adsorption and desorption energies.

AB The hydraulic conductivity of heterogeneous porous media depends on the distribution function and the geometry of local conductivities at the smaller scale. There are various approaches to estimate the effective conductivity K-eff at the larger scale based on information about the small scale heterogeneity. A critical geometric property in this 'upscaling' procedure is the spatial connectivity of the small-scale conductivities. We present an approach based on the Euler-number to quantify the topological properties of heterogeneous conductivity fields, and we derive two key parameters which are used to estimate K-eff. The required coefficients for the upscaling formula are obtained by regression based on numerical simulations of various heterogeneous fields. They are found to be generally valid for various different isotropic structures. The effective unsaturated conductivity function K-eff (psi(m)) could be predicted satisfactorily. We compare our approach with an alternative based on percolation theory and critical path analysis which yield the same type of topological parameters. An advantage of using the Euler-number in comparison to percolation theory is the fact that it can be obtained from local measurements without the need to analyze the entire structure. We found that for the heterogeneous field used in this study both methods are equivalent. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI ADAPTIVE METHODS FOR PARAMETER-IDENTIFICATION IN GROUND-WATER HYDROLOGY
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper considers the simultaneous identification of parameters and source term appearing in elliptic Partial Differential Equations from knowledge of the reference potential, which satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions. Identifying the unknowns means complying with the equation error criterion. The adaptive method consists of transforming both the potential and the unknown parameters into time-dependent quantities, which evolve according to given laws. In the continuum case, the time decay property of a Lyapunov function is shown to hold.
   Next, the finite-dimensional (Galerkin) approximation of the evolution equations is considered and, given the existence of a solution, the pertaining convergence results are stated s. t., the time-dependent potential approaches the reference potential and the unknowns asymptotically comply with the time-independent equation.
   Then, the discrete identification problem is stated. The finite element method is used to obtain the discrete equation error criterion. A Eulerian numerical scheme for all discretized evolution equations is provided. The sequences of the corresponding solutions i. e., the potential and the unknowns, are shown to converge. The detailed proof is provided.
   Finally, the above method is applied to the identification of hydraulic conductivity, leakage parameter and source term of a two-layered aquifer in the Aachtal (Germany) area. The numerical results obtained from noiseless and noisy potential data are provided.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID BED
AB A two-equation turbulence model, based on the k-epsilon closure scheme, was used to determine the mean flow and turbulence structure of open channels through simulated vegetation, thus providing the necessary information to estimate suspended sediment transport processes. Dimensional analysis allowed identification of the dimensionless parameters that govern suspended sediment transport in the presence of vegetation and thus helped in the design of numerical experiments to investigate the role of different flow properties, sediment characteristics, and vegetation parameters upon the transport capacity. A reduction of the averaged streamwise momentum transfer toward the bed (i.e., shear stress) induced by the vegetation was identified as the main reason for lower suspended sediment transport capacities in vegetated waterways compared to those observed in nonvegetated channels under similar flow conditions. Computed values of kinematic eddy viscosity were used to solve the sediment diffusion equation, yielding distributions of relative sediment concentration slightly in excess of the ones predicted by the Rousean formula. A power law was found to provide a very good collapse of all the numerically generated data for suspended sediment transport rates in vegetated channels.

DE rainfall-runoff modelling; Pitman model; limited data; land-use change;
   India
AB A rainfall-runoff model has been established to simulate streamflow in a regulated catchment in southern India, where data were limited in relation to the basin's complexity. Within the basin is a network of hydropower reservoirs and tunnels that complicate the relationships between observed and natural flows. The basin is affected by two monsoons that dominate in different areas and can only be quantified through a relatively sparse raingauge network. These characteristics combine to make it difficult to satisfactorily define the spatial distribution of rainfall inputs to the basin. After critically assessing the data that were found to be inconsistent and unrepresentative, various assumptions about the operation of the system were tested. Despite incomplete streamflow data and the complex hydropower system, the limiting factor affecting successful simulations of streamflow at the basin outlet was the uncertain representativeness of the calculated area[ rainfall. The final outcome is a model, which despite shortcomings, is considered to be a useful water resources management tool that provides a sound basis for further studies.

AB A theoretical model is formulated to investigate the development of the amplitude of alternate bars in unsteady flows.  The problem is tackled by means of a weakly nonlinear analysis developed in a neighborhood of the threshold conditions for bar formation.  Bar response to unsteady flow is found to depend on a parameter U-triple-over-dot that is a measure of the ratio between the time scale of the basic flow and the time scale of bar growth.  The present theory shows that if U-triple-over-dot is O(1), as often occurs in nature, flow unsteadiness affects the instantaneous growth rate and phase of bar perturbations and controls the final amplitude reached by the bed configuration.  A procedure for determining the final amplitude for a given flood event is proposed.  Flume experiments were performed to test the main theoretical results.  The bed response to unsteady flow was measured for different values of the period of the flood.  The observed temporal behavior of the bar amplitude proves to be strongly affected by the unsteady character of the flow for U-triple-over-dot of O(1), as predicted by the theory.

AB Numerical models of flow in the vadose zone require capillary pressure-saturation relationships for the grid blocks discretizing the medium. However, the scale of these grid blocks is generally much larger than the sample scale at which capillary pressure-saturation relationships are measured. This study investigates the upscaling of capillary curves under static conditions of capillary-gravity equilibrium. The averaging regions are horizontal layers, parallel to the phreatic surface, as in one-dimensional models of infiltration. At the point or sample scale it is assumed that all capillary curves can be normalized using the Leverett (1941) approach to a common dimensionless form described by the Corey-Brooks model. Static water saturation at any point in the medium is then expressed as a parametric function of three regionalized variables, permeability, porosity, and irreducible water saturation. Water saturations at the layer scale are obtained by spatial averaging of point-scale values. With certain assumptions it is shown that the nondimensional relationship between capillary pressure and saturation at the layer scale is the same as at the sample scale. In general, the nondimensional scaling of layer-averaged capillary pressure requires exhaustive knowledge of the spatial distribution of the permeability-porosity ratio within the averaging region. However, when permeability and porosity are jointly lognormal, this spatial distribution may be approximated by a lognormal model requiring only two parameters for each averaging region. The developments are illustrated using published field data from the Apache Leap tuff site. Exact and estimated upscaled capillary curves are compared in simulated coregionalized fields of permeability, porosity, and irreducible water saturations. Results show that the upscaled capillary pressure-saturation curves accurately reproduce the vertical saturation profile obtained by exhaustive spatial averaging of point-scale water saturations.

AB Movement of snowmelt water through a thin saturated layer at the infiltrating base of a snowpack is modelled by applying the kinematic wave theory. Analytical solutions are obtained for flow depth, velocity and discharge assuming that the rate of input to the saturated layer due to vertical percolation is constant. This assumption results in a linear rise and recession of the snowmelt hydrograph. The solutions are extended to the case of time-varying input. An explicit consideration of infiltration leads to a free boundary problem.

ID FLOW
AB A package of simulation models has been developed to study the hydrological processes controlling runoff and to predict flow hydrographs in the Indian arid zone. The models describe rainfall-runoff in the upland phase and the interaction between runoff and transmission losses in the channel phase, so as to derive the drainage basin outflow hydrograph. In the upland phase the rising limb of the hydrograph is predicted through a regression model and the recession through a conceptual analogue of discharge from a single leaky reservoir. The leaky reservoir is described by a continuity equation and by discharge-stage and storage-stage relationships at the outlet. In the channel phase the governing equations for movement of a flood wave subjected to the transmission losses are simplified through a time averaging process to develop an ordinary differential equation describing transmission losses as a function of distance, inflow, channel width, time parameters of flow and effective hydraulic conductivity. These models are simplified acid developed to require a minimum of observed data for calibration. The package of models can be applied to ungauged drainage basins through parameterization.

AB A number of short-term variable discharge pumping tests were conducted on sloping fault zones cutting serpentinites from a thrust complex in north Portugal. The fault zones were identified and geometrically characterized by geological mapping, interpretation of aerial photographs and electromagnetic survey. The evolution of specific drawdowns obeyed two different laws: (1) specific drawdown-time points fitted to straight lines in log-linear scatter plots. In these cases, test data were interpreted by the Cooper-Jacob method, as if fault zones were regular confined porous media aquifers, (2) specific drawdown-time points fitted to straight lines in bilinear scatter plots. Because the available theoretical models were unable to match the observed data. a new approach was developed. The approach introduces the concept of impermeable barrier with variable effective position, a barrier that is represented by the upper limit of the fault zone aquifer. The mechanics of the method is still based on the concepts and formulae of confined porous media aquifers. including the framework of the image well theory. The calculated transmissivities (T = 7 x 10(-7) -2 x 10(-4) m(2)/s) and storage coefficients (S = 2 x 10(-5) -6.1 x 10(-4)) are within those commonly found for confined aquifers in fractured rocks.

AB From the end of August to the beginning of October, the support of the annual flood of the Senegal River by the multipurpose Manantali Dam requires high release volumes, which can be problematic for its hydro-electric production. To facilitate the programming of this objective by predicting reserves available in the reservoir at the end of the monsoon, attempts are made to predict in August the natural flood volume of the river for September-October, starting from an index of pluviometric anomalies calculated at the end of July for these two months by the model "ARPEGE Climat". After a principal components analysis of these indexes produced on a 300 x 300 km grid covering West Africa, a 1200 x 1200 km zone may be determined shifted to the east of the basin, where the eigenvectors of the indexes are related to the natural discharge of September-October by linear regression with five parameters (R-2 = 0.651). This statistical relationship calculated for the period 19792000 is validated for the period 2001-2005.

AB On the basis of the degree of mineralization, the groundwater of Apan-Tochac sub-basin may be considered as fresh (TDS < 500 ppm). However, chlorination is necessary to make it fit for human consumption. Major ion analyses of over 235 water samples reveal a striking relationship between hydrochemical evolution and the groundwater flow system. A high content of total dissolved solids, and low values of the Ca:Mg ratio are present in wells located on the plain (discharge zone), whereas opposite conditions are associated with wells located in higher regions (recharge zone). Statistical data analysis using the method of principal components allowed to differentiation of two hydrochemical families: (a) low mineralization corresponding to the recharge zone, and (b) high mineralization corresponding to the discharge zone. Waters of the Ca + Mg + HCO3, and Na + Mg + HCO3 hydrochemical facies are present and the former is dominant, The water is slightly alkaline, having slight problems of salinity during the year owing mainly to Ca2+HCO3- and Na+Cl- salts. The hydrochemistry of the groundwater reflects the pattern of local groundwater flow for this sub-basin.

AB By introducing the concept of a finest possible time resolution in concentration observations, we extend the probabilistic Lagrangian transport formulation to account for the statistics of locally measured concentration values and their dependence on observation method for short pulse solute inputs. The outlined methodology for quantifying the ensemble expected value and variance of locally measured concentration values is relevant for transport under either unsaturated or saturated flow conditions and for different types of observation methods. The methodology is exemplified here for direct pore water sampling in aquifers (perfectly stratified/near-field transport, or three-dimensional isotropic and far-field transport) and for solute that is non-reactive or undergoes linear (reversible equilibrium or nonequilibrium, and irreversible) sorption. For nonreactive solute and for solute that undergoes irreversible sorption or equilibrium sorption-desorption, the observation procedure greatly influences the variance of locally measured solute concentrations: both the concentration variance and the coefficient of variation decreases considerably as the sampled water volume/sampling time increases. For solute that undergoes nonequilibrium sorption-desorption, both the concentration variance and the observation effect on the variance are considerably smaller than for nonreactive solute or solute undergoing equilibrium or irreversible sorption. The reason is that the concentration variance is highly dependent on the sorption kinetics, which implies that simple rules, based on average solute behavior, for when the sorption-desorption process can be regarded as being in equilibrium may be irrelevant for describing the concentration variance in heterogeneous fields.

DT Article
ID ASSIMILATION; DYNAMICS
AB Past studies on soil moisture spatial variability have been mainly conducted at catchment scales where soil moisture is often sampled over a short time period; as a result, the observed soil moisture often exhibited smaller dynamic ranges, which prevented the complete revelation of soil moisture spatial variability as a function of mean soil moisture. In this study, spatial statistics (mean, spatial variability and skewness) of in situ soil moisture, modeled and satellite-retrieved soil moisture obtained in a warm season (198 days) were examined over three large climate regions in the US. The study found that spatial moments of in situ measurements strongly depend on climates, with distinct mean, spatial variability and skewness observed in each climate zone. In addition, an upward convex shape, which was revealed in several smaller scale studies, was observed for the relationship between spatial variability of in situ soil moisture and its spatial mean when statistics from dry, intermediate, and wet climates were combined. This upward convex shape was vaguely or partially observable in modeled and satellite-retrieved soil moisture estimates due to their smaller dynamic ranges. Despite different environmental controls on large-scale soil moisture spatial variability, the correlation between spatial variability and mean soil moisture remained similar to that observed at small scales, which is attributed to the boundedness of soil moisture. From the smaller support (effective area or volume represented by a measurement or estimate) to larger ones, soil moisture spatial variability decreased in each climate region. The scale dependency of spatial variability all followed the power law, but data with large supports showed stronger scale dependency than those with smaller supports. The scale dependency of soil moisture variability also varied with climates, which may be linked to the scale dependency of precipitation spatial variability. Influences of environmental controls on soil moisture spatial variability at large scales are discussed. The results of this study should be useful for diagnosing large scale soil moisture estimates and for improving the estimation of land surface processes.

AB In winter, lakes and lagoons at high altitudes or high latitudes have interesting hydrological cycles that differ from those in other seasons or in other regions, because water surfaces are covered with ice. Hydrological balances of lakes and lagoons are complex dynamic systems, and to elucidate them, isotopic tracers of water have been used as effective tools along with observations of precipitation, evaporation, inflows, and outflows. Here, to understand hydrological processes during freezing periods in the brackish Saroma-ko Lagoon, Hokkaido, northern Japan, we examined horizontal and vertical distributions of salinity and isotope compositions of lagoon water and ice in 2005 and 2006. Horizontal and vertical gradients of salinity and isotope compositions were observed from the river mouth to the sea channel, and factors determining these distributions were considered. The mixing of freshwater and seawater and a freezing effect were presumed to be factors in relationships between salinity and isotopes and in relationships between surface waters and ice just above the water. A simple box model for water balance was constructed based on these putative factors to reproduce the distributions of salinity and isotope compositions of surface waters and ice. An evaluation of the model revealed that this hydrological system is controlled primarily by horizontal advection of the epilimnion, freshwater influx, and the ice growth rate.

AB The plotting of the time rate of change in discharge dQ/dt versus discharge Q has become a widely used tool for analyzing recession data since Brutseart and Nieber [Water Resour Res 13 (1977) 637-643] proposed the method. Typically the time increment At over which the recession slope dQ/dt is approximated is held constant. It is shown here this that leads to upper and lower envelopes in graphs of log(-dQ/dt) versus log(Q) that have been observed in previous studies but are artifacts. The use of constant time increments also limits accurate representation of the recession relationship to the portion of the hydrograph for which the chosen time increment is appropriate. Where dQ/dt varies by orders of magnitude during recession, this may exclude much of the hydrograph from analysis. In response, a new method is proposed in which At for each observation in time is properly scaled to the observed drop in discharge Delta Q. It is shown, with examples, how the new method can succeed in exposing the underlying relationship between dQ/dt and Q where the standard method fails. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB [1] The hydrology of riparian wetlands worldwide has been altered extensively owing to the construction and operation of dams. We developed a model for the Roanoke River floodplain (United States) to simulate flood extent and duration based on a power law correlation between inundation area A, as mapped from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, and river discharge Q. Model fit was 0.955 for the upper portion of the study area and 0.789 for the tidally influenced lower section. We then compared hydroperiod simulated for predam (1912-1949) and postdam (1965-1995) periods. Topographically wet areas are now flooded longer than before damming, and dry areas are now drier. Similarly, hydrologically wet years experience longer floods, whereas the driest years are drier. Most importantly, spring hydroperiod regimes are now wetter than prior to damming. Our results suggest that the intermediate zone of the hydrologic gradient has been squeezed to either wetter or drier conditions. The model presented represents a simple but effective empirical method to simulate hydroperiod regimes at the landscape scale in large lowland systems where the data necessary to develop more complex physical models are not available.

AB Using simultaneous scaling, soil spatial variability of hydraulic functions can be described from a single set of scaling factors. The conventional scaling approach is based on empirical curve fitting, without paying much attention to the physical significance of the scaling factors. In this study, the concept of simultaneous scaling of the soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions is applied to a physically based scaling theory. In this approach, it is assumed that soils are characterized by a lognormal pore-size distribution, which leads directly to lognormally distributed scaling factors. To test this concept, a total of 143 undisturbed soil samples were collected from two soil depths (25 and 50 cm), with each depth divided into two subsets based on the median soil capillary pressure head value, as determined from the lognormal pore-size distribution assumption. Moreover, the theory was compared with the conventional simultaneous scaling method. Both the conventional and physically based simultaneous scaling method performed equally well for all four subsets, as determined from the reduction in weighted root mean squared residual (WRMSR) values after scaling. We showed that the theoretical interpretation of the lognormal scaling factor distribution was applicable to simultaneous scaling of soil hydraulic functions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB At the Valley of Fire State Park, southeastern Nevada, there is a unique relationship between deformation bands and the distribution of diagenetic mineralization in the Aztec Sandstone, a reservoir and aquifer analog exposed at the surface. Distinct diagenetic alteration fronts are refracted where they cross deformation bands. Modeling this refraction as resulting from the advective transport of a nonreactive solute, we are able to back out that deformation band permeability is reduced by an average of 1.3 orders of magnitude relative to the surrounding rock with a range of 0.7 to 2.1 orders of magnitude. The geometric relationship utilized in our approach formed in the subsurface during diagenesis and provides an in situ measurement of permeability not affected by uplift and erosion or by damage associated with collecting a sample from a well bore. Our estimation is about 1 order of magnitude lower than values reported in the literature for similar rock types.

AB The summer discharge pattern of the Skeldal River, which drains a 560 km(2) partly glacierized catchment in northeast Greenland, is dominated by diurnal oscillations reflecting variations in the melt rate of snow and ice in the basin. Superimposed on this diurnal pattern are numerous short-lived discharge fluctuations of irregular periodicity and magnitude. The larger fluctuations are described and attributed to both rainfall events and periodic collapse of the glacier margin damming flow from beneath the Skelbrae glacier. Other minor fluctuations are less readily explained but are associated with changes in the channelized and distributed reservoirs and possibly temporary blockage of subglacial conduits caused by ice melt with subsequent damming.
   Fluctuations in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) are normally associated with discharge fluctuations, although examples of 'transient flushes' were observed where marked increases in SSC occurred in the absence of corresponding discharge variations. A strong relationship between the event discharge increase and event SSC increase for rainfall-induced events was established, but no such relationship existed for non-rainfall-induced events. There is some evidence for an exhaustion effect in the SSC patterns both at the event time-scale and as the month proceeds. A mean suspended sediment load of 1765 +/- 0.26 t day(-1) was estimated for the study period, which would be equivalent to a suspended sediment yield of 732 +/- 4 t km(-2) year(-1).

AB A major problem in developing digital elevation models (DEMs) is the realistic representation of flow though complex terrain. A contour-based DEM, which uses natural flow lines and contours to define the element network in the model, is an elegant solution in that the governing equations of flow can be reduced to one dimension. Previous methods of constructing contour-based element networks require a high level of user involvement to produce the flow net. A new method for constructing contour-based element networks is presented that relies solely on contour data and does not rely on user-defined high points, saddle points, streamlines, or boundary files. Critical points such as high points and saddle points are automatically detected and a robust scheme is used to create flow lines. An improved method for calculating element attributes for the final DEM is also presented that takes into account the nonplanar nature of typical elements in contour-based networks. Furthermore, the inherent deficiencies of traditional flow line construction methods are discussed, and to an extent Overcome, resulting in a more realistic model. Preparation time for DEM construction has been reduced, and the user is given greater control over the rules for calculating flow lines. The algorithm has been implemented on a typical desktop computer, and comparisons have been made with existing contour-based element network construction methods. Results show improved speed and robustness over traditional methods and emphasize the convenience of minimal data requirements.

AB Late winter sampling of snowpack depth and density was conducted in five subarctic forest and forest-tundra landscape types north of the east arm of Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories between March 28 and April 9, 1990.  Tree and sampling density were nonnormal in distribution in study sites with stems < 1500 ha-1, and normally distributed in dense forest.  For the Hoarfrost River area, average snow depth, density, and water equivalent were 40.7 +/- 7.9 cm, 0.17 +/- 0.05 g cm-3, and 6.58 +/- 1.99 cm, respectively.  Variation in snowpack depth and density was low within each site, indicative of relatively homogeneous snow conditions.  Snow density was negatively correlated with tree stem density.  For the Hoarfrost River area, both snow depth and variability in snow density increased with tree stem density.  Variability in snow depth increased with variability in snow density.  Snow depth was more variable in forest-tundra than in forest sites.

This procedure could be applied to any watershed where basic physical information is available (areas, slopes, length of channels, soil type). A qualitative comparison between results obtained and those published previously produced satisfactory results. Thus it is possible to conclude that the procedure is adequate. However, it is also necessary to compare it with real field measurements.

ID CANADA; PARAMETERIZATION; SCALE
AB Problems related to scale continue to be at the forefront of research in hydrology. Past research into issues of scale has focused mainly on digital elevation model grid size, the appropriate number and size of sub-areas for subdividing a watershed, parameter transferability between watersheds and appropriate scales for linking hydrological and general circulation models. Much less attention has been given to the effects of scale on the representation of land cover and hydrological model response. Recent studies with respect to changes in land cover and hydrologic response have tended to focus on the issue of land cover maturity and the conversion of land through agricultural and forestry practices. The focus of this study is to examine the impact of the level of detail at which land cover is represented in modelling the hydrological response of Wolf Creek Basin in northwest Canada. A grid-based land cover map with a spatial resolution of 30 m is coarsened or smoothed using several common grid-based methods of aggregating categorical data, including: pixel thinning, modal smoothing and modal aggregation. A majority rule method based on polygons is also applied to the 30 m base cover. The SLURP hydrologic model is calibrated for the base cover and used as a reference for comparing simulations for the coarsened or 'generalized' land cover maps. Results of the simulations are compared to examine the sensitivity of hydrologic response to generalized land cover information. Comparisons of the SLURP model runs for Wolf Creek suggest that reducing the level of detail of land cover information generally has a limited effect on hydrologic response at the outlet. However, results for averages of water balance components across the basin suggest that the local variability of hydrologic response is affected in general. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB An important problem in hydrologic science is understanding how river flow is influenced by rainfall properties and drainage basin characteristics. In this paper we consider one approach, the use of mass exponents, in examining the relation of river flow to rainfall and the channel network, which provides the primary conduit for transport of water to the outlet in a large basin. Mass exponents, which characterize the power-law behavior of moments as a function of scale, are ideally suited for defining scaling behavior of processes that exhibit a high degree of variability or intermittency. The main result in this paper is an expression relating the mass exponent of flow resulting from an instantaneous burst of rainfall to the mass exponents of spatial rainfall and that of the network width function. Spatial rainfall is modeled as a random multiplicative cascade and the channel network as a recursive replacement tree; these fractal models reproduce certain types of self-similar behavior seen in actual rainfall and networks. It is shown that under these modeling assumptions the scaling behavior of flow mirrors that of rainfall if rainfall is highly variable in space, and on the other hand flow mirrors the structure of the network if rainfall is not so highly variable.

ID SOIL; FLOW
AB Centrifugal force is an alternative to large pressure gradients for the measurement of low values of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(sat)).  With a head of water above a porous medium in a centrifuge bucket, both constant-head and falling-head measurements are practical at forces up to at least 1800 times normal gravity.  Darcy's law applied to the known centrifugal potential leads to simple formulas for K(sat) that are analogous to those used in the standard gravity-driven constant- and falling-head methods.  Both centrifugal methods were tested on several fine-textured samples of soil and ceramic with K(sat) between about 10(-10) and 10(-9) m/s.  The results were compared to falling-head gravity measurements.  The comparison shows most measurements agreeing to within 20% for a given sample, much of the variation probably resulting from run-to-run changes in sample structure.  The falling-head centrifuge method proved to be especially simple in design and operation and was more accurate than the constant-head method.  With modified apparatus, K(sat) measurements less than 10(-10) m/s should be attainable.

To characterize network properties quantitatively we used three scaling exponents in the relationships l proportional to L(nu l), w proportional to L(nu w), and h proportional to L(nu h) where l, w, h are some characteristic longitudinal, transversal, and vertical scales of a channel network; L is the total length of channel network in three-dimensional space; and nu(l), nu(w), and nu(h) are the self-affine scaling exponents. We determined nu(l), nu(w), and nu(h) using L(p) proportional to A(beta), L(p) proportional to A(epsilon), and S proportional to A(-theta), where, L(p) is the length of the projection of the longest river channel on the horizontal plane, L(p) is the total length of channel network projection on the horizontal plane, A is the catchment area, and S is the local slope. An approximate relationship nu(h) approximate to nu(l) - theta(nu(l) + nu(w)) is derived which connects the main scaling exponents. For two New Zealand rivers, we found nu(l) = 0.60 and nu(w) = 0.40. On the basis of simple considerations, we estimated a range of possible values of nu(h) from 0.1 to 0.5 with 0.2 for the case study. The slope-area-elevation relation introduced by Willgoose [1994] was applied to interpret data concerning nu(h). The influence of threshold area (TA) values on the scaling properties of channel networks is shown to be small, and double scaling relationships are suggested for connecting the physical scaling of channel networks with scaling caused by threshold effect.

AB Measurements of relative permeability-saturation-capillary head relationships (k(r)-S-h(c)) during unsteady state displacement of water by air in soil cores reveal several unique behaviors that have not been previously described. Extremely low air relative permeability (k(ra)) was observed, which increased independent of saturation, by up to an order of magnitude to approach Brooks-Corey k(ra)(S) estimates. These effects were more extreme at faster displacement rates and are inferred to reflect the development and subsequent breakthrough of pore scale dead-end air fingers, which initially do not conduct air flow. Furthermore, k(ra)(h(c)) estimates tended to be accurate, and where low k(ra)(S) was observed, h(c)(S) was significantly below moisture retention data. Where k(ra)(S) approximated Brooks-Corey estimates, h(c)(S) approximated moisture retention data. A calculated backbone (conductive) air saturation, which is the total air saturation minus the dead-end air saturation, was found to control both k(ra) and h(c). Generally, water relative permeability data followed common functional relationships.

AB This study addresses the influence of landslide dams on surface water drainage and groundwater flow. In the study area of Scanno Lake and Sagittario River (Central Italy), a limestone rockslide-avalanche formed a lake, which has an outlet that is occasionally active, showing infiltration into the rockslide dam. Several springs are present at the lake's base and are partly fed by seepage through the rockslide debris. Piezometric surveys, discharge measurements, pumping tests and chemical analyses are tools used to build a conceptual model of the groundwater flow and to evaluate the flow through the rockslide debris. Seasonal water isotopic signatures validate the assumed model, showing a mixing of infiltration recharge and groundwater seepage throughout the rockslide debris. Various recharge areas have been found for springs, pointing out those directly fed by the rockslide debris aquifer. Hypotheses about seasonal groundwater mixing between the regional carbonate aquifer and the rockslide debris aquifer are supported by isotope results. Seasonal changes in groundwater table level due to recharge and surface losses from seasonal outlet have been correlated with isotopic groundwater composition from the rockslide debris aquifer and the downstream springs; this relationship highlights the role of the rockslide dam body on the hydrodynamics of the studied area. Relationships between surface waters and groundwater in the area have been completely understood on the basis of water isotopic fingerprinting, finally obtaining a complete evaluation of groundwater renewable resources and its regimen.

AB In this, the second of two papers concerning the stochastic description of solute transport under unsteady flow conditions, we show how the ensemble-averaged solute transport equation derived in the companion paper [Wood and Kavvas, this issue] can be solved. A two-dimensional analysis is conducted under conditions that are representative of the Borden aquifer, and a solution to the ensemble-averaged solute transport equation is found numerically. The analytical model suggested by Dagan et al. [1996] is adopted for the velocity field mean and Lagrangian covariance functions. The numerical solution provides the ensemble-averaged concentration field under transient flow conditions; from this concentration field the first- and second-order moments of the ensemble-averaged solute plume are calculated. The ensemble-averaged plume moments compare favorably with the moments calculated using the approach of Dagan et al. [1996], with the plume moments from a Monte Carlo analysis, and with plume moments measured in the field. In our approach the Darcy-scale dispersion is not neglected, and it is shown that this dispersion term has a small but significant influence on the resulting solutions.

ID HYDRODYNAMIC DISPERSION; TRANSPORT; DIFFUSION; SOLUTE; BEDS
AB [1] We provide a physically based explanation for the complex macroscopic behavior of dispersion in porous media as a function of Peclet number, Pe, using a pore-scale network model that accurately predicts the experimental dependence of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient, D-L, on Pe. The asymptotic dispersion coefficient is only reached after the solute has traveled through a large number of pores at high Pe. This implies that preasymptotic dispersion is the norm, even in experiments in statistically homogeneous media. Interpreting transport as a continuous time random walk, we show that (1) the power law dispersion regime is controlled by the variation in average velocity between throats (the distribution of local Pe), giving D-L similar to Pe(delta) with delta = 3 - beta approximate to 1.2, where beta is an exponent characterizing the distribution of transit times between pores, (2) the crossover to a linear regime D-L similar to Pe for Pe > Pe(crit) approximate to 400 is due to a transition from a diffusion-controlled late time cutoff to transport governed by advective movement, and (3) the transverse dispersion coefficient D-T similar to Pe for all Pe >> 1.

   FLOW-TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID EQUATIONS
AB Modeling the transport of groundwater contamination leads generally to problems wherein the continuity equation is coupled with the contaminant transport equation and Darcy's law. Such a system of equations is called the flow-transport system and is difficult to solve numerically. An optimal control, H-1, least squares formulation, associated with a conjugate gradient algorithm, is proposed for solving the coupled flow and transport problem. At each time step, each discretized differential equation is transformed into an optimal control problem. This problem is then stated as an equivalent minimization problem. The objective function associated with the transport problem is chosen in such a way that it accurately represents the advective behavior of the equation for high values of the Peclet number. The Nazareth version of the conjugate gradient method is used for solving the problem iteratively. At each iteration, only the fight-hand side of the equation is changed. Thus, the approach is attractive when large-scale problems must be solved. Analysis of the preconditioning of the coefficient matrix provides insight into the behavior of this approach. Validation runs for a one-dimensional example show accurate results for a wide range of Peclet and Courant numbers.

ID CAPILLARY-FRINGE; FIELD; AQUIFER; SOIL; FLOW
AB New closed-form expressions are introduced to capture the dependence of specific yield on time and depth to water table. The expressions allow the user to convert observations of water table fluctuations to volumes of water released from storage in a shallow water table aquifer. Whereas a linear relationship between water table fluctuations and released volumes holds for a deep water table aquifer, this relationship is nonlinear for shallow water table aquifers. The dependence of specific yield on time stems from the slow drainage of soil water from pores above the water table. The new expressions allow determination of transient specific yield and time to drain the soil water profile for a given water table fluctuation. If the time step in a numerical groundwater model is longer than the time for limiting specific yield, then a constant (time independent) specific yield can be justifiably adopted. The new expressions are easy to use and require knowledge of soil hydraulic properties which are readily available from soil water retention data and surveys.

AB Extreme flood events have been and continue to be one of the most important natural hazards responsible for deaths and economic losses. Extreme floods result in direct destructive effects during the time of the event, and they also may be followed by a related chain of indirect calamities such as famines and epidemics that produce additional damages and suffering. Extreme hydrological events that have occurred in the historical past may also occur in the future. Knowledge about magnitudes and recurrence frequencies of past extreme hydrological events in most regions are too short to adequately evaluate potential magnitudes and recurrence frequencies of extreme hydrological events. Stationary climate in which the mean and variance do not change over time is a basic underlying assumption of standard methodological procedures for estimating recurrence probabilities of extreme hydrological events. Palaeo-archives contained in river and lake sediments, fossil plant and animal matter, ice layers, and other natural archives show that the assumption of stationary climate is not valid when the time scale is extended beyond centuries and millennia. Records of past extreme floods that occurred long before the period of instrumentation can be reconstructed from the distribution of slackwater flood deposits or from derivation of water depths competent to transport the largest rocks found in flood deposited sediment. Palaeoflood records reconstructed from the Upper Mississippi and Lower Colorado River systems in the United States confirm nonstationary behaviour of the mean and variance in hydrological time series. These stratigraphic records have shown that even very modest climatic changes have resulted in very important changes in the magnitudes and recurrence frequencies of extreme floods. A close relationship was found between the palaeo-flood record of extreme floods in the Upper Mississippi River system and a palaeo-record of stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon preserved in speleothem calcite from a local cave. The relationship suggests that isotopic records elsewhere might be calibrated to provide insight about how future potential climate changes might impact extreme flood magnitudes and recurrence frequencies there. Atmospheric global circulation models (GCMs) mainly simulate average climatic conditions and are presently inadequate sources of information about how future climate changes might be represented at the extreme event scale. Palaeo-flood archives, however, provide basic information about how magnitudes and recurrence frequencies of extreme hydrological events responded to past climate changes and they also provide a reference base against which GCM simulations can be calibrated regionally and be better interpreted to decipher hydrological information at the extreme event scale.

AB In discrete water quality surveys, riverine fluxes are associated with unknown uncertainties (biases and imprecisions). Annual flux errors have been determined from the generation of discrete surveys by Monte Carlo sorting for monthly sampling, from 10 years of daily records (120 records). Eight calculation methods were tested for suspended particulate matter, dissolved solids and dissolved and total nutrients in medium to large basins (10(3) to 10(6) km(2)) covering a wide range of hydrological conditions and riverine biogeochemistry. The performance of each method was analysed first by type of riverine material, which appeared to be much less pertinent than the flux variability matrix. The latter combines the river flow duration in two percent of time (W-2%) and the truncated exponent (b(50sup)) defining the relationship of concentration vs discharge (C-Q) at higher flows (C = aQ(b50sup)). As flux variability increases (high W-2% and/or high b(50sup)), averaging and rating curve methods become less efficient compared to hydrograph separation methods. Flux biases and imprecisions were plotted in the [W-2%, b(50sup)] matrix for discrete monthly surveys.

AB This study examined the spatial and temporal variability of throughflow in a shallow forest soil in terms of the controls exerted by topography, soil properties and the shape of the water table. Hillslope outflow was measured at nine troughs installed at a road cut, and hydraulic head was measured at 37 piezometers installed to the confining till surface at the base of the soil. At the lowest flows, the distribution of throughflow across the hillslope conformed reasonably to the distribution of upslope contributing area computed from the topography of the confining basal till layer. At higher flows, however, the distribution of throughflow shifted, partly as a result of changes in the orientation in how tubes as the piezometric surface changed. At high flows, surface topography appeared to provide a reasonable proxy for the shape of the water table. Shunting of water through discrete macropores, however, can apparently overwhelm topographic controls on throughflow, at least for slope widths less than about 10 m. Effective hydraulic conductivities computed at the scale of the troughs varied over two orders of magnitude and displayed no consistent relationship with the thickness of the saturated layer. Estimates at the plot scale (c. 10 m hillslope width) were far less variable, and for higher flows displayed an approximately linear relationship with saturated zone thickness.

TI Stream function finite elements for nearshore current
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents a finite element method for the analysis of nearshore current, which is mainly induced by surface waves. The analysis is divided into two parts, i.e., the analysis of wave and the analysis of currents. The basic equations are conservation of wave number, wave energy, momentum and continuity. The first two are for wave analysis and the last two for the current analysis. The wave angle is determined from the conservation law of wave number. Using the resulting wave angle and the conservation of wave energy, the distribution of wave height is derived. The radiation stress is derived from the wave angle and height. The nearshore current flow is obtained from the conservations of momentum and continuity including the radiation stress. All the numerical procedures are based on the finite element method. For the analysis of the wave angle and wave height, the incremental iteration method and logarithmic function formulation are employed. For the analysis of the current flow, the stream function formulation is used. From the numerical computations, it is seen that the finite element method presented in this paper is very valuable in practical applications. The method is applied to the analysis of the nearshore current flow of Twan Bay in Japan.

AB There has been an upsurge in studies of flood risk governance (FRG): steering and decision-making by public and private actors as a complement to risk assessments and technical management options. The scholarly debate is, however, highly fragmented, complicating the production of cumulative insights. To address this knowledge gap, we used six governance strategies for achieving flood resilience that previously have been put forward as a conceptual framework to review 121 articles published between 2016 and 2019, complemented with insights contained in recent overview articles, to gauge the state-of-the-art in FRG literature: to (a) diversify flood risk management strategies; (b) align the strategies; (c) adequately involve private actors, including citizens; (d) put an adequate rule system in place; (e) cater for sufficient monetary and non-monetary resources; (f) inspire an open and inclusive normative debate. We found, first, that literature is producing insights on increasingly technically advanced risk assessments and agent-based models but societal debate on justice in flood risk governance is getting attention. A clearly emerging topic is that of citizen engagement in flood risk governance. Second, the geographical focus of the studies is still skewed toward the Global North. To make progress in understanding flood risk governance for better resilience more systematic and comparative empirical assessments of flood risk governance in order to derive generalizable lessons while better taking into account the context-specificity of FRG. Testing flood risk governance solutions against comparative cases, by balancing the geographical scope of research efforts, and enhancing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary working is a way to deliver knowledge for more resilience.

AB A numerical method based on the modified method of characteristics is developed for incompressible Darcy flow. Fluid elements modeled as grid cells are mapped back in time to their twisted forms and a strict equality of volumes is imposed between the two. These relations are then cast in terms of potentials using Darcy's law and a nonlinear algebraic problem is solved for potentials. Though a general technique for obtaining Darcy flow, this method is most useful when the solute advection problem also is solved with the modified method of characteristics. The combined technique (referred to as the characteristic-conservative method) using the same characteristics to obtain both velocities and concentrations is then a direct numerical approximation to the Reynolds transport theorem. The method is implemented in three dimensions and a few sample problems featuring nonuniform flow-fields are solved to demonstrate the exact mass conservation property. Inflow and outflow boundaries do not cause any problems in the implementation, in all cases, the characteristic-conservative method obtains velocities that preserve fluid volume and, concentrations that achieve exact local and global mass balance; a desirable property that usually eludes characteristics based methods for solute advection in multidimensional, nonuniform flowfields.

DE SIMILARITY ANALYSIS; SCALING ANALYSIS; SOIL INFILTRATION
AB Similarity and scaling theory are applied to soil physics, specifically to several parameters of unsaturated soil water movement.  Following a dimensional analysis of Richards' equation, a mechanical similarity criterion of the hydraulic parameters is developed.  Dimensionless factors which conform to assumptions of kinematic and dynamic mechanical similarity in the flow system are converted to relations using the scale factor alpha derived under the assumption of geometric similarity.  As an example, the infiltration process is assessed through scaling of the parameters in Philip's equation, using experimental data from double-ring infiltration measurements at 54 locations in a study catchment as the scaling test.

AB Seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers is a 3-D phenomenon. However, 3-D regional aquifer models are often limited by insufficient geological and hydrological data, the large horizontal to vertical scales ratio, and by numerical constraints. We present an effective formulation for modeling seawater intrusion that relies on a dimensional reduction of the original density-dependent flow and transport problem. We carry out a vertical integration of the 3-D problem and arrive at a coupled set of 2-D equations for the mean flux and salt concentration, which are essentially identical to those of 2-D groundwater flow. However, two new terms emerge from the integration: (1) Darcy's law needs not only the buoyancy term reflecting aquifer bottom slope, but also another one reflecting variability of aquifer thickness; and (2) transport requires a new term reflecting vertical variations of groundwater flux, which are essential for density-dependent flow and we approximate by means of a Fickian dispersion term. The proposed equations are verified by direct steady state numerical simulations of confined aquifers. The results show that the effective formulation correctly reflects the effective dynamics in the 3-D system.

AB A study of flow resistance was undertaken in a channelized reach of the North Fork Toutle River, downstream of Mount St. Helens, Washington.  Hydraulic and sediment transport data were collected in flows with velocities up to 3 m/s and shear stresses up to 7 times the critical value needed for bed load transport.  Details of the flow structure as revealed in vertical velocity profiles indicate that weak bed load transport over a plane gravel bed has little effect on flow resistance.  The plane gravel bed persists up to stresses approximately 3 times critical, at which point, irregular bed forms appear.  Bed forms greatly increase flow resistance and cause velocity profiles to become distorted.  The latter arises as an effect of flows becoming depth-limited as bed form amplitude increases.  At very high rates of bed load transport, an upper stage plane bed appeared.  Velocity profiles measured in these flows match the law of the wall closely, with the equivalent roughness being well represented by k(s) = 3D84 of the bed load.  The effects noted here will be important in very large floods or in rivers that are not free to widen, such as those cut into bedrock.

TI CL-36 DATING OF VERY OLD GROUNDWATER .3. FURTHER-STUDIES IN THE GREAT
   ARTESIAN BASIN, AUSTRALIA
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The Great Artesian Basin (GAB), Australia, contains several groundwater types within the Lower Cretaceous-Jurassic confined aquifer system with distinctly different chemistry.  The groundwater flow pattern of the GAB has been analyzed with over 40 Cl-36 measurements from this study and that of Bentley et al. (1986a).  The results indicate general agreement between the hydrologic model ages (Darcy's law) and the radioisotopic model ages suggesting that flow conditions over approximately 1 m.y. have remained largely unchanged.  The results confirm that the chemically distinct western GAB operates as a separate flow system with its own recharge area and its own geochemical evolution.  The results indicate an area of groundwater with relatively young Cl-36 ages in the central portion of the basin which cannot be explained by flow or mixing along the presently known flow lines.  It is hypothesized that an additional source of young water originated from the basin margin region to the north and northwest between the Simpson Desert and Mount Isa.  This additional recharge area, active more strongly over the last 500 kyr than at present, is delineated by Cl-36 ages which integrate a history and evolution over the age of the groundwater.

AB Stable oxygen isotope analysis and measurement of several dissolved cations and anions of bulk meltwater samples have provided information about the hydrochemical environment of the glacial hydrological system at Imersuaq Glacier, an outlet tongue from the Greenland ice-sheet, West Greenland. The samples were collected at frequent intervals during the period 20-28 July 2000 in a small (<20 L s(-1)) englacial meltwater outlet at the glacier margin. The results document the following findings: (i) a marked diurnal variation of delta(18)O is related to the composition of oxygen isotope provenances, mainly near-marginal local superimposed ice and basal up-sheared ice further up-glacier; (ii) a relationship is seen between all base cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), SO42- and delta(18)O, indicating that solute acquisition is provided by solid-solution contact with the up-sheared ice-as the relationship with Cl- is weak the influence of seasalt-derived solutes is small in the area; (iii) when the melt rate is high, two diurnal maxima of delta(18)O values and solute concentrations are measured, and it is suggested that a snow meltwater component is responsible for the second maximum of delta(18)O-a short residence time leads to a delayed decrease in ion concentrations.

AB The caesium-137 technique affords both an alternative to conventional measurement methods and an effective quantitative estimate of soil redistribution at the basin scale. Among the available calibration relationships which link the degree of increase or depletion of the (137)Cs activity relative to the baseline (137)Cs input and sediment yield, the mass balance approach has received increased application for its physical basis. First, the applicability of the refined simplified point-based mass balance (RSPMB) model of Zhang et ai. (1999) at the scale of the morphological unit is proposed herein. The (137)Cs spatial distribution measured in a small Sicilian basin and the spatial distribution of the sediment yield calculated by a sediment delivery distributed approach are used to estimate values of the two key parameters of the RSPMB model, phi (1) and phi (2), the fraction of (137)Cs fallout incorporated into soil and a particle size correction factor, respectively. Finally, the best procedure for experimental testing of a distributed sediment yield model by using caesium-137 measurements is investigated.

AB The baseflow characteristics of some of the numerous small basins in southeastern Nigeria have been analysed to estimate the developable groundwater in the basins. It is shown that from 5.62 x 10(4) to 1.59 x 10(6) m3 of groundwater can be developed per square kilometre of basin per annum. The relationship between the baseflow characteristics and other attributes of the basins, such as geology and stream density, were studied statistically, leading to the development of empirical equations for predicting the hydrological features of the several ungauged streams in the region. It is shown, for example, that the basin geology (represented as the percentage of sands), the drainage density, the basin area, the baseflow depletion rate and the total groundwater stored in the basin, Q(tp), are related by the equation: Q(tP) = -1.85 x 10(9) - 7.96 x 10(8)dd +4.18 x 10(7)gf-2.01 x 10(6)df +6.25 x 10(5)wa where dd is drainage density; gf geological factor; df depletion factor; and wa basin area.

AB This paper provides the tools needed for analysis of multiphase flow in porous media. Contributions are in four areas. First, theorems are provided that allow global scale integral equations to be localized at the porous medium scale. This is a more general approach than the traditional averaging of microscale point equations. Second, conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy and entropy for phases, interfaces, common lines, and common points are obtained. The inclusion of common lines and common points completes the full description of multiphase flow in porous media. Third, the entropy inequality is developed for the full multiphase system. The interaction terms between phases, interfaces, common lines, and common points provide a clear direction as to whether the entropy equation for each of these components may be used in the development of a constitutive theory or if the constitutive theory will depend on a combined entropy inequality statement. Fourth, the simplification of the system of equations is presented for the case of massless interfaces and common lines where these constituents are still capable of sustaining stress and containing energy. These latter forms are particularly useful in consideration of capillary pressure terms when the mass of the interface may be considered negligible. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

AB A PLAG (PLAne GUESS) model based on the concept of Rose was developed and applied to a catchment of 40 ha in a semi-arid region of Tunisia. Rose described a mathematical model of soil erosion and deposition on a plane land element, which uses an approximate analytical theory of runoff on a plane assuming kinematic flow. The concept of stream power is used in representing the entrainment process. A sensitivity analysis of the nine parameters of the PLAG model was done using the Monte Carlo simulation procedure. The 10 000 simulations obtained showed that the fraction of soil surface unprotected from entrainment by overland flow, efficiency of entrainment by overland flow, and the slope of the plane are the most sensitive parameters of the model. The PLAG model was calibrated for an autumn rainstorm using the efficiency of entrainment by overland flow as the calibration parameter and the Monte Carlo simulation procedure. The efficiency of entrainment by overland flow and threshold value of stream power parameters were assessed using rainfall simulator data obtained in semi-arid parts of Tunisia. In this study, the best result of sediment Simulation corresponds to a relative error of 0.13% for a given calibration parameter.

TI A multi-objective fuzzy pattern recognition model for assessing
   groundwater vulnerability based on the DRASTIC system
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
ID CONTAMINATION
AB More and more problems with groundwater come from the increasing industrialization and the growing waste problem. The DRASTIC model has been used as a valuable tool in many parts of the world for assessing the vulnerability of groundwater. In the DRASTIC system, however, factors that Influence groundwater must be divided into ranges and then be given ratings according to whether or not their values can be directly measured. The system may give the same range and rating to those having obviously different values. As a result, DRASTIC may be unable to actually reflect the difference between factors and hydrogeological settings. In fact, there exists a transition from the easiest to be polluted to the most difficult to be polluted so that vulnerability of groundwater is of a fuzzy nature and therefore fuzzy sets theory can be used to assess the vulnerability of groundwater. In this paper, a multi-objective fuzzy pattern recognition model for assessing the pollution potential of groundwater is presented. It is compared with the DRASTIC model in a case study. It is shown that the fuzzy pattern recognition model can take the fuzziness into account more efficiently in the process of evaluating the vulnerability of groundwater.

AB The headwater catchments of the Yellow River Basin are of great importance for the whole basin in terms of water resources, and streamflow from these catchments has decreased in the last decades. The concept of climate elasticity was used to assess the impacts of climate and land surface change on the streamflow. Results show that for the period 1960-2000 the elasticity of streamflow in relation to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are 2.10 and -1.04, respectively, indicating that streamflow is more sensitive to precipitation than to potential evapotranspiration. However, land use change played a more important role than climate in reducing streamflow in the 1990s. It is estimated that land use change is responsible for more than 70% of the streamflow reduction in the 1990s, while climate change contributed to less than 30% of the reduction. The precipitation elasticity appears to have an inverse relationship with the runoff coefficient but a positive relationship with the aridity index, showing that the drier the catchment, the more sensitive the streamflow with respect to precipitation change.

AB Droughts, like floods, are extreme expressions of the river flow dynamics. Here, droughts are intended as episodes during which the streamflow is below a given threshold, and are described as multivariate events characterized by two variables: average intensity and duration. In this work, we introduce the new concept of Dynamic Return Period, formulated using the theory of Copulas, and calculated via a Survival Kendall's approach. We show how it can be used (i) to monitor the temporal evolution of a drought event, and (ii) to perform real time assessment. In addition, a randomization strategy is introduced, in order to get rid of repeated measurements, which may adversely affect the statistical analysis of the available data, as well as the calculation of the return periods of interest: a practical example is shown, involving the fit of the drought duration distribution. The case study of the Po river basin (Northern Italy) is used as an illustration.

ID CLIMATE EXPERIMENT GRACE; TIME-VARIABLE GRAVITY; RECOVERY; FIELD
AB We assess the accuracy of global-gridded terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates derived from temporal gravity field variations observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. The TWS data set has been corrected for signal modification due to filtering and truncation. Simulations of terrestrial water storage variations from land-hydrology models are used to infer relationships between regional time series representing different spatial scales. These relationships, which are independent of the actual GRACE data, are used to extrapolate the GRACE TWS estimates from their effective spatial resolution (length scales of a few hundred kilometers) to finer spatial scales (similar to 100 km). Gridded, scaled data like these enable users who lack expertise in processing and filtering the standard GRACE spherical harmonic geopotential coefficients to estimate the time series of TWS over arbitrarily shaped regions. In addition, we provide gridded fields of leakage and GRACE measurement errors that allow users to rigorously estimate the associated regional TWS uncertainties. These fields are available for download from the GRACE project website (available at http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov). Three scaling relationships are examined: a single gain factor based on regionally averaged time series, spatially distributed (i.e., gridded) gain factors based on time series at each grid point, and gridded-gain factors estimated as a function of temporal frequency. While regional gain factors have typically been used in previously published studies, we find that comparable accuracies can be obtained from scaled time series based on gridded gain factors. In regions where different temporal modes of TWS variability have significantly different spatial scales, gain factors based on the first two methods may reduce the accuracy of the scaled time series. In these cases, gain factors estimated separately as a function of frequency may be necessary to achieve accurate results.

LA English
DT Article
ID EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; MODEL
AB Regional scale latent heat flux (LE) was estimated from rawinsonde soundings of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) over the Konza tallgrass prairie in July 1986.  Two approaches were used to calculate LE:  similarity theory and an algebraic solution of a conservation equation for water vapor in the PBL.  Nine of the soundings were complete.  However, the latter five soundings only recovered data for every sixth possible level.  The results were compared with estimates made by an array of nine Bowen Ratio surface stations.  Similarity theory, using vertically averaged values, produced estimates that were reasonably close to the surface values.  However, the use of values at the top of the PBL resulted in large overestimation of the evaporation fluxes.  When complete soundings were available, the conservation equation yielded estimates which agreed very well with surface values.  The agreement was reduced for incomplete soundings.  This is likely related to the sensitivity of the equation to uncertainties in the height of the inversion.  Overall, the conservation equation produced estimates in closest agreement with the surface stations.  The results suggest that adequate vertical resolution of measured profiles is important for proper estimation of regional surface fluxes.

AB A meta-analysis data-driven approach is developed to represent the soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation. The new model is tested across a bare soil database composed of more than 30 sites around the world, a clay fraction range of 0.02-0.56, a sand fraction range of 0.05-0.92, and about 30,000 acquisition times. SEE is modeled using a soil resistance (r(ss)) formulation based on surface soil moisture (theta) and two resistance parameters rss,ref and theta(efolding). The data-driven approach aims to express both parameters as a function of observable data including meteorological forcing, cut-off soil moisture value theta 1/2 at which SEE=0.5, and first derivative of SEE at theta 1/2, named Delta theta 1/2-1. An analytical relationship between (rss,ref;theta efolding) and (theta 1/2;Delta theta 1/2-1) is first built by running a soil energy balance model for two extreme conditions with r(ss)=0 and rss similar to infinity using meteorological forcing solely, and by approaching the middle point from the two (wet and dry) reference points. Two different methods are then investigated to estimate the pair (theta 1/2;Delta theta 1/2-1) either from the time series of SEE and observations for a given site, or using the soil texture information for all sites. The first method is based on an algorithm specifically designed to accomodate for strongly nonlinear SEE(theta) relationships and potentially large random deviations of observed SEE from the mean observed SEE(theta). The second method parameterizes theta 1/2 as a multi-linear regression of clay and sand percentages, and sets Delta theta 1/2-1 to a constant mean value for all sites. The new model significantly outperformed the evaporation modules of ISBA (Interaction Sol-Biosphere-Atmosphere), H-TESSEL (Hydrology-Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchange over Land), and CLM (Community Land Model). It has potential for integration in various land-surface schemes, and real calibration capabilities using combined thermal and microwave remote sensing data.

AB [1] Comprehensive measurements are presented of the piezometric head in an unconfined aquifer during steady, simple harmonic oscillations driven by a hydrostatic clear water reservoir through a vertical interface. The results are analyzed and used to test existing hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic, small-amplitude theories along with capillary fringe effects. As expected, the amplitude of the water table wave decays exponentially. However, the decay rates and phase lags indicate the influence of both vertical flow and capillary effects. The capillary effects are reconciled with observations of water table oscillations in a sand column with the same sand. The effects of vertical flows and the corresponding nonhydrostatic pressure are reasonably well described by small-amplitude theory for water table waves in finite depth aquifers. That includes the oscillation amplitudes being greater at the bottom than at the top and the phase lead of the bottom compared with the top. The main problems with respect to interpreting the measurements through existing theory relate to the complicated boundary condition at the interface between the driving head reservoir and the aquifer. That is, the small-amplitude, finite depth expansion solution, which matches a hydrostatic boundary condition between the bottom and the mean driving head level, is unrealistic with respect to the pressure variation above this level. Hence it cannot describe the finer details of the multiple mode behavior close to the driving head boundary. The mean water table height initially increases with distance from the forcing boundary but then decreases again, and its asymptotic value is considerably smaller than that previously predicted for finite depth aquifers without capillary effects. Just as the mean water table over-height is smaller than predicted by capillarity-free shallow aquifer models, so is the amplitude of the second harmonic. In fact, there is no indication of extra second harmonics ( in addition to that contained in the driving head) being generated at the interface or in the interior.

AB The drying of liquid-saturated porous media is typically approached using macroscopic continuum models involving phenomenological coefficients. Insight on these coefficients can be obtained by a more fundamental study at the pore- and pore-network levels. In this paper, we present a model based on a pore-network representation of porous media that accounts for various processes at the pore-scale. These include mass transfer by advection and diffusion in the gas phase, viscous flow in liquid and gas phases and capillary effects at the gas-liquid menisci in the pore throats. We consider isothermal drying in a rectilinear horizontal geometry, with no-how conditions in all but one boundary, at which a purge gas is injected at a constant rate. The problem is mainly characterized by two dimensionless parameters, a diffusion-based capillary number, Ca, and a Peclet number, Pe, in addition to the various geometrical parameters of the pore network. Results on the evolution of the liquid saturation, the trapped liquid islands and the drying rate are obtained as a function of time and the dimensionless parameters. The importance of trapped liquid islands on screening mass transfer to the continuous liquid cluster is emphasized. For fixed parameter values, the drying front does not in general obey invasion percolation rules. However, as drying progresses, and depending on the relative magnitude of the capillary and Peclet numbers, a transition to a percolation-controlled problem occurs. Effects of capillarity and mass transfer on Saturation profiles and drying rates are discussed. The results are then used to discuss upscaling to continuum models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Rapid drawdown in slopes and embankments
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID STABILITY; MODEL
AB The rapid drawdown condition arises when submerged slopes experience a rapid reduction of the external water level. Classical procedures developed to determine the flow regime within the slope and the resulting stability conditions are reviewed in the paper. They are grouped in two classes: the "stress-based'' undrained approach, recommended for impervious materials, and the flow approach, which is specified for rigid pervious materials (typically a granular soil). Field conditions often depart significantly from these simplified cases and involve materials of different permeability and compressibility arranged in a complex geometry. The drawdown problem is presented in the paper as a fully coupled flow-deformation problem for saturated/unsaturated conditions. Some fundamental concepts are first discussed in a qualitative manner and, later, explored in more detail in synthetic examples, solved under different hypotheses, including the classical approaches. Some design rules, which include a few fundamental parameters for the drawdown problem, have also been solved in a rigorous manner to illustrate the limitations of simplified procedures. A significant portion of the paper is devoted to the discussion of a comprehensive case history. In Shira, earth dam pore pressures were recorded at different points inside the embankment during a controlled drawdown. Predictions of four calculation procedures (instantaneous drawdown, pure flow, coupled flow-elastic, and coupled flow-elastoplastic, all of them for saturated/unsaturated conditions) are compared with measured pressure records. Only the coupled analysis provides a consistent and reasonable solution. The role of the different soil properties in explaining the phenomena taking place during drawdown is finally discussed.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID EXPANSION METHOD; STREAM CHANNELS; DISCHARGE; TERM
AB Few studies have attempted to examine explicitly the factors that produce variation in hydraulic geometry parameters.  A continuously varying parameter model of downstream hydraulic geometry is formulated to address this issue.  Parameter variation is viewed as a function of channel sediment characteristics and flood magnitude.  Results for the Missouri River basin show that these factors are strongly associated with variation in hydraulic geometry coefficients and exponents.  The results also indicate that bivariate relationships are biased by these associations.  The analysis yields site-specific parameters that uniquely describe the relationship between active channel form and mean discharge at a particular location within the basin.  The continuously varying parameter approach has several advantages:  (1) it isolates the separate influences of each explanatory variable on each hydraulic geometry parameter, (2) it maintains the precision of parameter estimates by including the entire data set in the analysis, and (3) it allows testing of the conception that hydraulic geometry parameters vary continuously rather than discretely, yet permits analysis of discrete change through the use of dummy variables.

ID ENERGY-DISSIPATION MODEL; DRAINAGE BASINS; CHANNEL NETWORKS; DISCHARGE;

AB A physical explanation for the behavior of the cumulative area distribution (CAD) based on the Tokunaga channel network model is given. The CAD is divided into three regions. The first region, for small areas, is dependent on hillslope flow accumulation patterns and represents the catchment average of the hillslope flow accumulation in the diffusive erosion-dominated areas, upstream reaches, of the catchment. The second region represents that portion of the catchment dominated by fluvial erosion. This region is well described by a log-log linear power law, which results from the scaling properties of the channel network. The scale exponent, phi, is highly sensitive to a parameter of the Tokunaga stream numbering scheme. The exponent phi converges to -0.5 for higher order Tokunaga networks for parameters consistent with topological random networks. Small networks have lower values of phi, which asymptotic converges to phi = -0.5 as the catchment scale increase. The third region reflects the lowest reaches of the channel network, the scale of the catchment, and is a boundary effect. An explicit analytical solution to the scaling properties in the second region is derived on the basis of the Tokunaga network model.

AB A realistic description of land surface/atmosphere interactions in climate and hydrologic studies requires the specification of the rainfall forcing at aggregation scales of 1 hour or less. This is in contrast with the wide availability of daily rainfall observations and with the typically coarse output resolution of climate and numerical weather forecast models. Several methods have been devised to generate hourly or subhourly data from daily or monthly values, which usually rely on statistical regressions determined under the current climate conditions. Here we present a new method for downscaling rainfall in time using theoretically based estimates of rainfall variability at the hourly scale from daily statistics. The method is validated on a wide data set representative of different rainfall regimes and produces approximately unbiased estimates of rainfall variance at the hourly scale when a power law-tailed autocorrelation is assumed for the rainfall process. We further demonstrate how the downscaling method together with a Bartlett-Lewis rainfall stochastic model may be used to generate hourly rainfall sequences that reproduce the observed small-scale variability uniquely from daily statistics. Conclusions of a somewhat general nature are also drawn on the capability of finite memory stochastic models to reproduce the observed rainfall variability at different aggregation scales.

AB Evaporation plays a key role in the hydrology of a catchment. World-wide actual terrestrial evaporation is approximately two third of terrestrial precipitation. Evaporation is the focus of this study in which we describe the historical developments of models for estimating evaporation from standard meteorological data. Although Aristotle and Descartes made early contributions to understanding evaporation, Perrault is credited with having made the first experimental measurement of evaporation in about 1674 though in fact what he measured was sublimation by recording the loss of weight of a block of ice through time. In 1686, Halley carried out the first direct measurement of the evaporation of liquid water. Following a detailed set of experiments, Dalton in 1802 published an essay describing the relationship between evaporation, vapor pressure deficit, and wind speed which is the forerunner of the mass-transfer equation to estimate open-water evaporation. In 1921, Cummings proposed an approximate energy balance equation which in 1948 Penman combined with a mass-transfer equation based on Dalton's work to develop the Penman equation. A key input was the Bowen ratio published in 1926. Following Penman, the next major development was by Monteith in 1965. He modified Penman's equation for a single leaf to deal with a canopy which led to the Penman-Monteith model and is the basis of the FAO56 Reference Crop model. Priestley and Taylor introduced their model in 1972, which is based on the energy term in Penman's equation, and underpins other models. The application of the Complementary Relationship to estimating regional evaporation is credited separately to Brutsaert and Stricker and to Morton. Budyko offered two important contributions. First, he developed a potential evaporation equation in which the evaporating surface temperature was estimated by iteration, whereas Penman approximated a value from the ClausiusClapeyron equation. Budyko's second contribution is a simple relationship to estimate runoff and, in turn, mean actual evaporation. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Under a sustainable groundwater development and quality management project over a semi-arid granite terrain, several rainwater harvesting structures were proposed based on geophysical investigations in the study area. In order to validate the site suitability and check the efficacy of the recommended recharge structures in terms of source sustainability, certain hydrological tests, such as infiltration studies, were conducted within the recharge area of these structures. Infiltration rate estimation using a double-ring infiltrometer normally results in an exponential decay relationship with high initial infiltration rate followed by gradual reduction until, ultimately, a stabilized rate is attained. In this paper, we present the results of infiltration tests conducted using a double-ring infiltrometer (under constant head condition) within the tank bed area of a proposed percolation tank site. The results showed unique features in the infiltration rate at different time intervals within the total experimental period: a staircase-like evolution with intermittent stabilization for a short duration. Based on the integrated approach of geophysical investigations, hydrological tests, and supported by physical evidence, the infiltration behaviour observed over the study area was considered to be due to the lithological stratification with different permeability and textural conditions.

AB Appropriate model selection among three alternative multiobjective techniques is studied using an example in river basin planning. The three techniques are ELECTRE, compromise programming and multiattribute utility theory. Key questions in the selection process are concerned with the type of data required, the necessary amount of interaction between the decision maker and analyst, and the nature of the problem. Such characteristics are used as criteria to demonstrate whether or not a particular model can be successfully applied.

ID SYSTEMS; REGION
AB The region of southern Mesopotamia, in modern southern Iraq, was home to perhaps the world's oldest cities and complex societies. Such cities and towns developed closely to irrigation works and other water features, with major settlements developed along levees and so-called turtle backs made up of natural accumulation and human-made debris. While water was a critical component to the rise of cities, it was also the unique evolution of societies to their complex landscape, including the development of different social practices that made the region develop early cities. By-products of these social developments included religious institutions and inequality but also the rise of governments, written language, laws, and other forms of social development we associate with our own societies. Recent work in southern Iraq demonstrates that the region was likely occupied much earlier than we thought; new climate data and other work will mean our picture on how the environment shaped the development of urban-based societies in southern Mesopotamia will evolve in the coming years. New fieldwork, including surveys and excavations, will also shape a new understanding of how urbanism arose in this complex landscape.

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

DT Article
ID GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; MURRAY BASIN; LAND-USE; CLIMATE; WATER; CHLORIDE;
   IMPACTS
AB Effective management of water resources requires that all elements of the water balance be estimated. Groundwater recharge measurements are difficult, time consuming and expensive. In some cases a field study cannot be justified and simple empirical relationships are used to estimate recharge, and often the value chosen is simply a percentage of rainfall. This paper aims to use a database of 4386 field based estimates of recharge from 172 studies in Australia to produce simple empirical relationships that relate recharge to nationally available datasets and hence can be used to estimate recharge in data-poor areas in a scientifically defensible way.
   It was found that the vegetation and soil type were critical determinants in forming relationships between average annual rainfall and average annual recharge. Climate zones and surface geology (lithology) were not found to be significant determinants in the relationship between rainfall and recharge. The method used to estimate recharge had an impact upon the magnitude of the recharge estimates due to the spatial and temporal scales over which the different methods estimate recharge.
   Relationships have been developed here between average annual rainfall and average annual recharge for combinations of soil and vegetation type that can be used with only nationally available datasets to provide a recharge estimate. These relationships can explain 60% of the variance in recharge measurements across Australia. The uncertainty in the recharge estimated using these relationships is generally greater than an order of magnitude. This means that if these relationships are used to help determine water allocations, then the precautionary principle should limit allocations to less than about 5% of the estimated recharge. If allocations are greater than this, a more detailed site specific study is warranted.

TI ROTATIONAL DISPERSION IN POROUS-MEDIA DUE TO FLUCTUATING FLOWS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB We suggest that dispersion in a saturated porous medium subject to a fluctuating pressure gradient can occur as a result of the processes of shear (Taylor) dispersion and what we will label rotational dispersion. In contrast to shear dispersion, rotational dispersion does not rely on molecular diffusion to be effective but requires that the direction of the pressure gradient rotates with time. Such rotational gradients are ubiquitous in nature, occurring whenever a pressure wave propagates across the surface of a porous medium such as soil or marine sediments. The efficiency and character of rotational dispersion is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations of the dispersal of clouds of particles through a highly idealized porous medium. These simulations demonstrate that rotational dispersion behaves as a diffusive process and that it can be many times more effective than molecular diffusion or shear dispersion as a transport mechanism. The results of the theory were tested experimentally using a wave tank with a bed of sand as the porous medium. These experiments demonstrate that passing waves can greatly enhance solute transfer between the bed and the overlying water. Furthermore, the measured increases in solute transfer rates are quantitatively consistent with the predictions obtained from the theory of rotational dispersion presented herein.

AB Due to the ever-increasing demand for water resources, the pressure on their judicious utilization is also increasing. Besides being precious, water is also a very complex commodity. The dynamic nature of weather as well as the spatial variability of landmass contribute to the dynamic behaviour of the response of the watersheds to the natural and artificial inputs of water. This requirement has led to the formulation of continuous, distributed parameter, water balance simulation models capable of providing insight into the distribution and utilization of water in a watershed. Since they mimic the natural processes prevalent in the area, they are capable of providing many answers that are normally not easily available otherwise. In the present paper one such situation has been tackled using the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. The target question was to assess the return flow on account of introducing canal irrigation in a basin (Palleru river basin in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, India). Since the return flow is dependent on many aspects such as soil characteristics, method of irrigation, etc., it is not appropriate to put a rule-of-thumb value on such quantities. Through modelling, the return flow has been assessed and validated. The temporal variation of such return flows has also been captured. The virgin flows from the basin, before the manmade changes in construction of reservoir and importing water for irrigation were introduced, were also computed as per the requirement of the department. In fact this has been an exercise in demonstrating the usefulness of creating such a base framework capable of helping water managers in planning and management of this very vital resource.

AB A numerical model is presented for the prediction of floodplain inundation extents, flow depths and velocities, and patterns of suspended sediment dispersion and deposition. The model employs a simplified and novel treatment of fluid flow and a conventional convection-diffusion mass balance relationship for suspended sediment transport and deposition. These relationships are solved over a finite difference grid with a relatively fine nodal spacing, which enables a detailed representation of complex floodplain topography. The model is applied to a 600 m reach of the River Culm, Devon, UK. Continuous records of river stage and suspended sediment concentration monitored at the upstream boundary of the study reach provide the data needed to operate the model. These data are supplemented by measurements of the in situ settling characteristics of the suspended sediment load. Model predictions of overbank flow depths and velocities and patterns of suspended sediment concentrations and deposition amounts are presented. Predicted patterns of overbank deposition are described and compared with field measurements obtained with the aid of astroturf sedimentation traps. Grain size distributions obtained for samples of deposited sediment retrieved from the sedimentation traps are also examined and compared with model predictions. The results of both the field measurement programme and modelling work are shown to have significant implications for the representation of floodplain topography and suspended sediment particle size and settling properties in numerical simulations of overbank processes.

AB The Wadi Mikkes basin is located in the centre-north of Morocco. it comprises three distinct zones presenting diversified geology, and contains phreatic and confined aquifers in the Sais basin and a shallow aquifer in the tabular Middle Atlas. The basin has a roughly oceanic climate supported by groundwater. The large decrease in water level in the aquifers of the Mikkes basin observed since the beginning of the 1980s is probably duo to the combined effect of drought and overexploitation. This, in turn, has an influence on springs and wadi flow. For the Sais groundwater, the positive correlation and the proximity of temporal fluctuation curves between the river flow and the piezometric level outside flood periods, suggest a supply drainage relationship between the aquifer :And the river. The resemblance between the graph of the variations in piezometric level of the groundwater and that of the deep groundwater leads us to suppose that there is a hydraulic connection between the deep groundwater and the river. However, due to very strong infiltration within the tabular Middle Atlas, it was not possible to demonstrate a positive correlation between river levels and the groundwater.

AB The accuracy of the time compression analysis (TCA) is analyzed by comparison with a numerical solution. Both the standard TCA and a new modified TCA are considered for a power law diffusivity and constant surface flux. As expected, the error of the approximations decreases with increasing power, and the error of the modified TCA is about half the error of the standard TCA. In a second part, the errors of the two TCAs are measured using a simple analytical solution instead of a numerical solution. It is shown that the conclusions remain the same for the analytical and numerical solutions. The advantage of using the analytical Solution is to obtain simple analytical expressions, showing the influence of parameters. This is done to estimate the maximum error of both TCAs. A practical estimate of the errors can be obtained from equations which only require knowledge of the soil water diffusivity. It appears that for real soils the errors of the TCA are always <1% and thus are a very reliable tool for practical problems. Although not studied systematically, it also appears that gravity effects reduce the errors of the TCA so that the error obtained in the absence of gravity provides a conservative estimate when gravity is present.

AB A wide range of phenomena, natural as well as man-made, in physical, chemical and biological hydrology exhibit characteristics similar to those of kinematic waves. The question we ask is: can these phenomena be described using the theory of kinematic waves? Since the range of phenomena is wide, another question we ask is: how prevalent are kinematic waves? If they are widely pervasive, does that mean hydrology is kinematic or close to it?

AB This paper explores the similarities of digital elevation maps (DEMs) of natural river basins and optimal channel network (OCN) configurations obtained minimizing the total rate of energy expenditure in the system as a whole and in its parts. Striking similarities are observed for natural and optimal networks in their fractal aggregation structure and in certain multifractal structures found to be characteristic of river basins. Our results suggest, upon critical assessment of the reliability of the identification of the attractor of the underlying dynamics implied by our optimality concepts, that fractal structures are indeed possibly a product of least energy dissipation. Power laws emerging in the description of the distribution of aggregated quantities from both DEMs and OCNs suggest a link with the framework of self-organized criticality in the dynamics of natural channel network formation. Also, the geomorphological description of OCNs reveals surprising analogies with well-known empirical or experimental results. A comparison of Peano's basins with OCNs suggests that nature seems to reject the type of strict self-similarity exhibited by Peano's construct in favor of different shapes implying statistical self-similarity not only because of chance acting through random conditions but also because of necessity as reflected by least energy expenditure considerations.

AB This paper studies the relation between the structure of river networks and the features of their geomorphologic hydrologic response.  A mathematical formulation of connectivity of a drainage network is proposed to relate contributing areas and the network geometry.  In view of the connectivity conjecture, Horton's bifurcation ratio R(B) tends, for high values of Strahler's order OMEGA of the basin, to the area ratio R(A), and Horton's length ratio R(L) equals, in the limit, the single-order contributing area ratio R(a).  The relevance of these arguments is examined by reference to data from real basins.  Well-known empirical results from the geomorphological literature (Melton's law, Hack's relation, Moon's conjecture) are viewed as a consequence of connectivity.  It is found that in Hortonian networks the time evolution of contributing areas exhibits a multifractal behavior generated by a multiplicative process of parameter 1/R(B).  The application of the method of the most probable distribution in view of connectivity contributes new inroads toward a general formulation of the geomorphologic unit hydrograph, in particular generalizing its width function formulation.  A quantitative example of multifractal hydrologic response of idealized networks based on Peano's construct (for which R(B) = R(A) = 4, R(L) = 2) closes the paper.

AB [1] The effective hydraulic conductivity of a randomly heterogeneous isotropic porous medium has been calculated by means of a new perturbative technique, which differs greatly from that commonly used. In the approach developed, we construct the perturbation series for a seepage velocity and then utilize Darcy's law for calculating pressure. On the basis of the analysis of high-order approximations it is shown that in the general case the effective conductivity in the large-scale limit does depend on the form of the correlation function. Thus the widespread Landau-Lifshitz-Matheron formula, which operates on the conjecture that the first two terms of the perturbation series are those for the Taylor series expansion of an exponential function, proves to be invalid. The calculations were carried out in a space of arbitrary dimension. The dependence of the effective conductivity on the variance has been obtained up to the third-order approximation inclusive in terms of a conductivity logarithm. For convenience and simplification of series analysis the Feynman diagrammatic technique was developed and utilized. In a one-dimensional (1D) case our result in the large-scale limit ( when a heterogeneity scale is small enough with respect to the characteristic scale of groundwater flow) gives an exact formula for the effective conductivity.

AB We use homogenization theory to investigate the asymptotic macrodispersion in arbitrary nonuniform velocity fields, which show small-scale fluctuations. In the first part of the paper, a multiple-scale expansion analysis is performed to study transport phenomena in the asymptotic limit epsilon << 1, where epsilon represents the ratio between typical lengths of the small and large scale. In this limit the effects of small-scale velocity fluctuations on the transport behavior are described by a macrodispersive term, and our analysis provides an additional local equation that allows calculating the macrodispersive tensor. For Darcian flow fields we show that the macrodispersivity is a fourth-rank tensor. If dispersion/diffusion can be neglected, it depends only on the direction of the mean flow with respect to the principal axes of anisotropy of the medium. Hence the macrodispersivity represents a medium property. In the second part of the paper, we heuristically extend the theory to finite epsilon effects. Our results differ from those obtained in the common probabilistic approach employing ensemble averages. This demonstrates that standard ensemble averaging does not consistently account for finite scale effects: it tends to overestimate the dispersion coefficient in the single realization.

TI Interaction of valleys and circulation patterns (CPs) on spatial

DT Article
ID WIND-DRIVEN RAINFALL; VARIABILITY; TOPOGRAPHY; MODELS; SWEDEN; SPACE
AB Topography exerts influence on the spatial precipitation distribution over different scales, known typically at the large scale as the orographic effect, and at the small scale as the wind-drift rainfall (WDR) effect. At the intermediate scale (1 similar to 10 km), which is characterized by secondary mountain valleys, topography also demonstrates some effect on the precipitation pattern. This paper investigates such intermediate-scale topographic effects on precipitation patterns, focusing on narrow-steep valleys in the complex terrain of southern Germany, based on the daily observations over a 48 yr period (1960 similar to 2007) from a high-density rain-gauge network covering two sub-areas, Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW) and Bavaria (BY). Precipitation data at the valley and non-valley stations are compared under consideration of the daily general circulation patterns (CPs) classified by a fuzzy rule-based algorithm. Scatter plots of precipitation against elevation demonstrate a different behavior of valley stations comparing to non-valley stations. A detailed study of the precipitation time series for selected station triplets, each consisting of a valley station, a mountain station and an open station have been investigated by statistical analysis with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test supplemented by the One-way analysis of variance (One-way ANOVA) and a graphical comparison of the mean precipitation amounts. The results show an interaction of valley orientation and the direction of the CPs at the intermediate scale, i.e. when the valley is shielded from the CP which carries the precipitation, the precipitation amount within the valley is comparable to that on the mountain crest, and both larger than the precipitation at the open station. When the valley is open to the CP, the precipitation within the valley is similar to the open station but much less than that on the mountain. Such phenomenon where the precipitation is "blind" to the valleys at the intermediate scale conditioned on CPs is defined as the "narrow-valley effect" in this work. Such an effect cannot be captured by the widely used elevation-precipitation relationship, which implies that the traditional geostatistical interpolation schemes, e.g. ordinary kriging (OK) or external drift kriging (EDK) applying digital elevation model (DEM) as external information, are not sufficient. An interpolation experiment applying EDK with orographic surrogate elevation defined in this paper as auxiliary information to account for the valley effects shows improvement for the cross-validation.

TI Satellite observations reveal 13 years of reservoir filling strategies,

   basin
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The current situation in the Lancang-Mekong River basin is emblematic of the issues faced by many transboundary basins around the world: riparian countries prioritize national water-energy policies and provide limited information on how major infrastructures are operated. In turn, such infrastructures and their management become a source of controversy. Here, we turn our attention to the Upper Mekong River, or Lancang, where a system of 11 mainstream dams controls about 55 % of the annual flow to Northern Thailand and Laos. Yet, assessing their actual impact is a challenging task because of the chronic lack of data on reservoir storage and dam release decisions. To overcome this challenge, we focus on the 10 largest reservoirs and leverage satellite observations to infer 13-year time series of monthly storage variations. Specifically, we use area-storage curves (derived from a digital elevation model) and time series of water surface area, which we estimate from Landsat images through a novel algorithm that removes the effects of clouds and other disturbances. We also use satellite radar altimetry water level data (Jason and Sentinel-3) to validate the results obtained from satellite imagery. Our results describe the evolution of the hydropower system and highlight the pivotal role played by Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs, which make up to similar to 85 % of the total system's storage in the Lancang River basin. We show that these two reservoirs were filled in about 2 years and that their operations were marginally affected by the drought that occurred in the region in 2019-2020. Deciphering these operating strategies will help enrich existing monitoring tools and hydrological models, thereby supporting riparian countries in the design of more cooperative water-energy policies.

TI IMPROVING DETENTION RESERVOIR EFFICIENCY BY A PARALLEL DRAIN DESIGN
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In a previous paper it was established that a simple relationship exists between the peak reduction ratio and the relative storage ratio of unregulated detention reservoirs.  The relationship, named the efficiency function of the reservoir, depends on the physical features of the reservoir and its outlet, and also on the shape of the inflow hydrograph.  For a specified type of reservoir and a given inflow hydrograph, the efficiency function predicts the storage volume needed to produce a desired peak flow reduction.  In this paper, it is demonstrated that it is possible to achieve the same peak flow reduction with a smaller reservoir if a parallel drain design is used.  In this design procedure the inflow hydrograph is split into two parts.  One part is routed through a detention reservoir and the second part is allowed to bypass the reservoir.  The two parts are recombined below the reservoir to form the outlet hydrograph which is the sum of two hydrographs with staggered peaks.  By a proper choice of the proportion of flow directed through the reservoir it is possible to achieve a desired peak flow reduction with a significant reduction in active storage.

AB Ice-sheet modelling typically uses grid cells 10 km or more on a side, so any hydrological and sliding model must average or parameterize processes that vary over shorter distances than this. Observations and theory suggest that basally produced water remains in a distributed, high-pressure system unless it encounters low-pressure channels fed by surface melt. Such distributed systems appear to exhibit increasing water storage, water transmission and water lubrication of sliding with increasing water pressure. A model based on these assumptions successfully simulates some aspects of the non-steady response of mountain glaciers to externally forced channel-pressure variations; it merits testing in ice-sheet modelling.

TI APPLICATION OF A CONCEPTUAL RUNOFF MODEL IN DIFFERENT PHYSIOGRAPHIC
   REGIONS OF SWITZERLAND
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB In this analysis, a semi-distributed conceptual runoff model was applied in five basins varying in area between 43 and 195 km2, lying in different physiographic regions of Switzerland (lowland, alpine, heavily glaciated high alpine basins) representing various runoff regimes. An objective, labour-intensive optimization procedure was developed and found suitable for deriving optimal parameter values. A separate calibration procedure was employed in the heavily glaciated basin, as glacier mass balance data measured at different elevations were deemed very helpful for finding plausible parameter values. The results show that this conceptual runoff model can be successfully applied in various physiographic regions, without structural changes, to calculate daily discharge. However, no conclusive relationships between parameter values and basin characteristics could be found. One reason may be that the investigated sample was too small. It is also felt that the inherent structure of this type of conceptual model is not suited to relating parameter values representing lumped model characteristics with physical basin characteristics. The advantages of conceptual models are such that they can be readily applied in various physiographic regions and therefore constitute a valuable tool for operational hydrology.

AB In this contribution, we review long-term (millennial-decadal scale) river-flow changes, climate interactions, and interlinkage with vegetation dynamics, as well as society and policy, focusing on the lower Limpopo Valley (from the South African border through Mozambique). Drawing on paleoecological data, we address the valley's potential for defining critical ecological thresholds and managing an adaptive ecological landscape, by focusing on the dynamic relationship between different drivers (fire, hydrology, and grass/tree relationships). We briefly review the long-term interactions between water flow, climate variability, and society using archeological records and written sources. Lastly, we analyze the social and political context of water management, focusing on the last 100 years and transboundary water management. We also discuss planning and mitigation in relation to climate change and rainfall extremes that are projected to increase. It is stressed that forward-thinking policies must heed long-term climate variability, hydrology and biological and social impact and to plan and mitigate for environmental events. The discussion also brings to the fore the importance of an adaptable and equitable strategy in cross-border water sharing. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Stable isotope ratios in precipitation and their relationship with

AB For the first time, environmental isotopic (delta(2)H, delta(18)O, (3)H) data, predominantly based on precipitation samples in the Kumaon Himalayas, India, have been used to understand the influence of various meteorological factors governing rainout processes in the region. Further, the data are also used to understand the orographic effects in precipitation and to estimate the altitude effect in stable isotopic ratios in precipitation, etc.
   The interpretation of the isotopic data revealed that the source of moisture for winter (October-February) and summer (May) precipitation in the Kumaon Himalayas is mainly from the Western Disturbances whereas for the remaining period the source is monsoonal (southwest). The delta(2)H-delta(18)O relationship in the local precipitation during the monsoon season shows a distinct seasonal effect, with a slope of 7.6. The winter and summer precipitation samples measured higher environmental (3)H compared to southwest monsoon samples, thus indicating continental evaporated moisture. There is wide range of altitude effects (delta(18)O variation per 100 m elevation: -0.30 parts per thousand [July-August]; -0.57 parts per thousand [September]) with the mean altitude effect being -2.61 parts per thousand and -0.36 parts per thousand per 100 m elevation for delta(2)H and delta(18)O respectively. These values are different from that reported earlier for the region based on the isotopic compositions of springs/rivers samples. The 'altitude effect' in successive precipitation is basically a temperature dependent phenomenon and is explained on the basis of adiabatic cooling related rainout process (dry adiabatic lapse rate, moist adiabatic lapse rate and saturated adiabatic lapse rate for moist air mass). The altitude effect is found to be more reliable in case of delta(2)H, as deuterium is least affected by secondary evaporation. The effect of secondary evaporation has been observed on the true "altitude effect". Secondary evaporation of rainfall increases the oxygen isotopic ratios and the increase is directly proportional to the vertical distance travelled by the raindrops through air.

AB Better understanding of spatial variability of soil hydraulic parameters and their relationships to other soil properties is essential to scale-up measured hydraulic parameters and to improve the predictive capacity of pedotransfer functions. The objective of this study was to characterize scaling properties and the persistency of water retention parameters and soil physical properties. Soil texture, bulk density, organic carbon content, and the parameters of the van Genuchten water retention function were determined on 128 soil cores from a 384-m transect with a sandy loam soil, located at Smeaton, SK, Canada. The wavelet transform modulus maxima, or WTMM, technique was used in the multifractal analysis. Results indicate that the fitted water retention parameters had higher small-scale variability and lower persistency than the measured soil physical properties. Of the three distinct scaling ranges identified, the middle region (8-128 m) had a multifractal-type scaling. The generalized Hurst exponent indicated that the measured soil properties were more persistent than the fitted soil hydraulic parameters. The relationships observed here imply that soil physical properties are better predictors of water retention values at larger spatial scales than at smaller scales.

ID MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE; MESOSCALE RAINFALL; POINT-PROCESSES; MODEL;
   REPRESENTATIONS; PRECIPITATION; GENERATION
AB In the study of space-time rainfall it is particularly important to establish characteristic properties to guide both theoretical and modeling research efforts. In the present paper, new observational analyses on the scaling properties of time-evolving cumulated rainfall fields are presented, and a theoretical framework for their interpretation is introduced. It is found that the time evolution of the spatial organization of a cumulated rainfall field produces scaling relationships of spatial Variance versus time and characteristic values for the scaling exponent. The reproduction of these Values constitutes a basic requirement for spatial-temporal field generators in order to model important properties of real rainfall fields. It is then shown, on theoretical grounds, what properties the instantaneous rainfall intensity fields must obey in order to reproduce the experimental observations and how the size of the observation domain affects the scaling relationships. Some current stochastic models of space-time precipitation are finally discussed and analyzed in the light of the tools introduced, to show under what circumstances the models considered give acceptable results. Furthermore, it is shown that the assumption of an exponential time correlation function, used in many current rainfall models, is not compatible with observations.

AB Soil structure and preferential flow are thought to be highly related, but quantification of this relationship has remained problematic. A combination of experiments on two soils at local and field scale was used to study the relationships between the degree of structural development, saturated conductivities K-s, moisture release, breakthrough parameters, and observations of preferential flow at the field scale. The convection dispersion equation and mobile-immobile model were fitted to breakthrough curves, and flow channels were stained with dye. Well-developed structure was associated with high dispersivities, a high coefficient of variation of K-s, and low mobile water contents, low exchange coefficients, and a low dyed area. Field-scale observations matched the differences in structure and preferential flow parameters observed at the local scales. Local-scale preferential flow appeared to highly influence field-scale solute transport, indicating that this is an important local-scale process which is not dampened at the field scale. A conceptual model of subsoil structural development was expanded with physical parameters matching the structural development stage to predict the likelihood of preferential flow on the basis of the saturation regime of the horizon or pedon.

TI AN ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FOR ONE-DIMENSIONAL TRANSPORT IN POROUS-MEDIA
   WITH AN EXPONENTIAL DISPERSION FUNCTION
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB An analytical solution describing the transport of dissolved substances in heterogeneous porous media with an asymptotic distance-dependent dispersion relationship has been developed.  The solution has a dispersion function which is linear near the origin (i.e., for short travel distances) and approaches an asymptotic value as the travel distance becomes infinite.  This solution can be used to characterize differences in the transport process relative to both the classical convection-dispersion equation which assumes that the hydrodynamic dispersion in the porous medium remains constant and a dispersion solution which has a strictly linear dispersion function.  The form of the hydrodynamic dispersion function used in the analytical solution is D(x) = alpha(x)upsilonBAR + D(diff), where alpha(x) = a L[1 - e(-bx/L)] and upsilonBAR is the average pore water velocity.  The proposed model may provide an alternate means for obtaining a description of the transport of solutes in heterogeneous porous media, when the scale dependence of the dispersion relationship follows the behavior given by alpha(x).  The overall behavior of the model is illustrated by several examples for constant concentration and flux boundary conditions.

AB Daily evapotranspiration from a winter wheat field on the North China Plain measured by large-scale weighing lysimeter was linearly related to that measured by the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) technique. Soil evaporation averaged about 23.6% of evapotranspiration from the post-winter dormancy revival stage to the grain ripening stage in 1999. On clear days during winter dormancy, about half of the net radiation flux R-n was used to warm soil. During the revival stage, conductive heat flux G also used most of the incoming R-n, but the ratio of latent heat flux; E to R-n increased. During the stem-extension stage, lambdaE was about 50% of R-n; thereafter, lambdaE/R-n increased continually, but G remained less than 10% of R-n. During the ripening stage, lambdaE was almost 90% of R-n. Evaporative fraction (EF) can be expressed as a function of plant status and atmospheric boundary layer conditions. The relationship between EF and available energy under moderate air temperature and vapour pressure deficit conditions was examined for five combinations of aerodynamic and canopy conductance. Although the theoretical relationship indicates that EF should be highly correlated to soil water content, the correlation has been difficult to identify under field conditions. However, we observed that there exists a threshold value of R-n - G, above which EF is less than 1.0, and that the threshold value is lower under soil-water deficit conditions than under abundant soil-water conditions.

AB A Gumbel distribution for maxima is proposed as a model for the depths of interrill overland flow. The model is tested against three sets of field measurements of interrill overland flow depths obtained on shrubland and grassland hillslopes at Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, southern Arizona. The model is found to be a satisfactory fit to 81 of the 90 measured distributions. The shape 3 and location X parameters of all fitted distributions are strongly correlated with discharge. However, whereas a common relationship exists between discharge and 8 for all depth distributions, the relationships with X vary systematically downslope. Using the Gumbel distribution as a model for the distribution of overland flow depths, a probabilistic model for the initiation of fills is developed, drawing upon the previous work of Nearing. As an illustration of this approach, we apply this model to the shrubland and grassland hillslopes at Walnut Gulch. It is concluded that the presence of rills on the shrubland, but not on the grassland, is due to the greater runoff coefficient for the shrubland and/or the greater propensity of the shrubland for soil disturbance compared with the grassland. Finally, a generalized conceptual model for rill initiation is proposed. This model takes account of the depth distribution of overland flow, the probability of flow shear stress in excess of local soil shear strength, the spatial variability in soil shear strength and the diffusive effect of soil detachment by raindrops.

AB Field values of horizontal hydraulic conductivity measured in the upper 1.5-5.5 m of a weathered and fractured clay-rich till were strongly influenced by smearing around piezometer intakes, which occurs during augering, and by the physical scale of the measuring device. Values measured in conventional augered piezometers were typically 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than those measured in piezometers designed to reduce smearing. Measurements of hydraulic conductivity in small-scale seepage collectors or piezometers, which typically intersect fewer than 10 fractures, vary over a much greater range, 10(-10) to 10(-6) m/s, than large-scale values based on infiltration into 5.5-m-deep trenches which intersect thousands of fractures (range 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-7) m/s). Values of hydraulic fracture aperture, 1-43 mum, and fracture porosity, 3 x 10(-5) to 2 x 10(-3), were calculated using the cubic law with fracture orientation/distribution measurements and the small-scale hydraulic conductivity measurements. This paper provides the first reliable determination of the magnitude and spatial distribution of hydraulically derived fracture parameters in a clay deposit. The absence of such data has, until now, severely limited the application of quantitative groundwater flow and contaminant transport models in this type of deposit.

AB High resolution airborne laser data provide new ways to explore the role of topographic complexity in hydraulic modelling parameterisation, taking into account the scale-dependency between roughness and topography. In this paper, a complex topography from LiDAR is processed using a spatially and temporally distributed method at a fine resolution. The surface topographic parameterisation considers the sub-grid LiDAR data points above and below a reference DEM, hereafter named as topographic content. A method for roughness parameterisation is developed based on the topographic content included in the topographic DEM. Five subscale parameterisation schemes are generated (topographic contents at 0, +/- 5, +/- 10, +/- 25 and +/- 50 cm) and roughness values are calculated using an equation based on the mixing layer theory (Katul et al., 2002), resulting in a co-varied relationship between roughness height and topographic content. Variations in simulated flow across spatial subscales show that the sub grid-scale behaviour of the 2-D model is not well-reflected in the topographic content of the DEM and that subscale parameterisation must be modelled through a spatially distributed roughness parameterisation. Variations in flow predictions are related to variations in the roughness parameter. Flow depth-derived results do not change systematically with variation in roughness height or topographic content but they respond to their interaction. Finally, subscale parameterisation modifies primarily the spatial structure (level of organisation) of simulated 2-D flow linearly with the additional complexity of subscale parameterisation.

AB The ability of simple equations to predict bed load transport with limited knowledge of the bed surface material was investigated. This was done using a data set consisting of 7,636 bed load transport values from the flume (1,317 data) and from 84 river reaches (6,319 field data). It was possible to collapse field and flume data by correcting the ratio between the Shields number and its critical value with a very simple hiding function proposed as a power law of the D(84)/D(50) ratio. In so doing, a surface-based bed load transport formula was proposed. It was successfully tested on an independent data set (comprising sand and gravel bed rivers with slope in the range 0.0002-0.08), with 86% of the values predicted within a precision of 1 order of magnitude. Moreover, the formula reproduced the low transport rates well, contrary to the usual surface-based formulas also tested, and is particularly well suited for estimating low transport rates associated with near-bankfull flow discharge. This new formula is neither time consuming (no fractionwise calculation) nor data consuming (the required parameters are the flow discharge, the active width, the slope, and the surface grain diameters D(50) and D(84)).

AB Data assimilation techniques, such as the Kalman filter (KF) and its extensions, update state variables based on the KF type of algorithms, but state-space models usually have relevant physical laws or settings. The updated states by the KF may violate some physical constraints, which can be equality or inequality, and linear or nonlinear constraints. This paper presents three methods, the naive method, the projection method and the accept/reject method, to incorporate constraints into the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Essentially, the projection method projects the updated ensemble members from the unconstrained EnKF to the feasible space characterized by the constraints. The accept/reject method tries to enforce the updated states to obey the constraints by resampling the observation error and model error. The three methods are applied to a conceptual hydrologic model for state estimation and sequential parameter learning, with specific treatment of inequality constraints. Both the reject/accept and projection methods perform better than the naive method which treats the hard constraint in a simple way and ignores other constraints. It is easy to implement the accept/reject method, the performance of which is comparable to the projection method regarding both the estimation quality and the computational time with the case study.

AB Infiltration into the soil is restricted if the movement of displaced air is hampered. In this study, separate infiltration experiments were performed where the air could escape only through capillary glass tubes (three different diameters were used). Control experiments, where the air movement was not restricted, were performed also. During the experiments both air pressure and the cumulative infiltration were measured. Air pressure measurements showed a rapid rise to a maximum after the water was ponded, followed by a gradual decrease. A first aim of this study was to show that even for a small increase in pressure relative to the case where the air was free to escape, e.g., <1 cm of water, there was a small but measurable reduction in infiltration. The air movement was obtained as a function of the air pressure via Poiseuille's law. By equating air and water movement (both fluids assumed incompressible) it was shown that the air pressure measurements could be used in predicting the water flux into the column and hence the cumulative infiltration. Then, by using the precise air pressure measurements for the various capillary tubes we were able to assess the sensitivity of hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity to minor increases in air pressure.

AB In order to account for subgrid-scale spatial variability (heterogeneity) of land surface characteristics in regional-scale hydrological-atmospheric models, a land surface parameterization of areally-averaged sensible heat and evapotranspiration fluxes which is based upon areally-averaged hydrological soil water flow and soil heat flow equations, was developed. This land surface parameterization is fully coupled in a two-way interaction with the atmospheric boundary layer and the regional atmospheric model's first layer. The Monin-Obukhov similarity theory which is utilized in modelling the atmospheric boundary layer, and the areally-averaged hydrological conservation equations are strictly valid only over stationary-heterogeneous areas where the fluctuations of the hydrological and boundary layer state variable values, parameter values, and of boundary conditions have spatially invariant means, spatially invariant higher moments and spatially invariant probability distributions. Therefore, the coupled two-way interactive model was run first for the computation of land surface fluxes over stationary-heterogeneous land patches, each corresponding to a single soil texture-vegetation class. Then, utilizing a mosaic scheme, the land surface fluxes over a regional model grid cell were obtained by numerical probabilistic averaging. The application of the regional model with this land surface parameterization to California during April 1989 has produced promising results.

AB Metrics based on streamflow and/or climate variables are used in water management for monitoring and evaluating available resources. To reflect future change in the hydrological regime, metrics are estimated using climate change information from Global Climate Models or from stochastic time series representing future climates. Whilst often simple to calculate, many metrics implicitly represent complex physical process. We evaluate the scientific validity of metrics used in a climate change context, demonstrating their use to reflect aspects of timing, magnitude, extreme values, variability, duration, state, system services, and performance. We raise awareness about the following generic issues (a) formulation: metrics often assume stationarity of the input data, which is invalid under climate change; and do not always consider potential changes to seasonality and the relevance of the temporal window used for analysis; (b) climate change input data: how well are the physical processes relevant to the metric represented in the climate change input data; what is the impact of bias correction on relevant spatial and temporal scale dependencies and relevant intervariable dependencies; how realistic are the data in representing sequencing of events and natural variability in large-scale ocean-atmosphere systems; and (c) decision-making context: are rules and values that frame the decision-making process likely to remain constant or change in a future world. If critical climate or hydrological processes are not well represented by the metric constituents, these indices can be misleading about plausible future change. However, knowledge of how to construct a robust metric can safeguard against misleading interpretations about future change. This article is categorized under:

AB An integrated forecast-decision system for Folsom Lak, (California) is developed and used to assess the sensitivity of reservoir performance to various forecast-management schemes under historical and future climate scenarios. The assessments are based on various combinations of inflow forecasting models, decision rules, and climate scenarios. The inflow forecasting options include operational forecasts, historical analog ensemble forecasts, hydrologic ensemble forecasts, GCM-conditioned hydrologic ensemble forecasts, and perfect forecasts. Reservoir management is based on either heuristic rule curves or a decision system which includes three coupled models pertinent to turbine load dispatching, short-range energy generation scheduling, and long/mid-range reservoir management. The climate scenarios are based on historical inflow realizations, potential inflow realizations generated by General Circulation Models assuming no CO2 increase, and potential inflow realizations assuming 1% CO, annual increase. The study demonstrates that (1) reliable inflow forecasts and adaptive decision systems can substantially benefit reservoir performance and (2) dynamic operational procedures can be effective climate change coping strategies.

AB There is a significant spatial sampling mismatch between radar and rain gauge data. The use of rain gauge data to estimate radar-rainfall error variance requires partitioning of the variance of the radar and rain gauge difference to account for the sampling mismatch. A key assumption in the literature pertaining to the error variance separation method used to partition the variance is that the covariance between radar-rainfall error and the error of rain gauges in representing radar sampling domain is negligible. Our study presents the results of an extensive test of this assumption. The test is based on empirical data and covers temporal scales ranging from 0.25 to 24 h and spatial scales ranging from 1 to 32 km. We used a two-year data set from two high quality and high density rain gauge networks in Oklahoma and excluded the winter months. The results obtained using a resampling procedure show that covariance can be considerable at large scales due to the significant variability. As the variability of the covariance rapidly increases with larger spatial and shorter temporal scales, applications of the error variance separation method at those scales require more caution. The variability of the covariance and one of its constituting variables, the variance ratio of radar and gauge errors, shows simple scaling behavior well characterized by a power-law.

AB The fractal structure of the drainage network and the (subsequent) set of dividers within a watershed is analyzed for four digitized catchments in Colombia and the United States. In order to understand the intrinsic scales involved, sets of networks and dividers were identified under different drainage conditions (pixel-thresholds). Then, the fractal dimensions of such sets were studied (within each watershed) looking for structure as a function of stream order. Two Horton-like laws are reported for the average fractal dimension of the sets of drainage networks and the sets of their dividers. The implications of the new laws are discussed.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to generate stable microbubbles and to measure their transport properties in porous media in order to evaluate their possible use in subsurface remediation. A mathematic model was developed as a special case of filtration theory for predicting microbubble transport in porous media. Several physical-chemical parameters were tested, including surfactant type, surfactant concentration, generation method, and pressure. A combination of an anionic surfactant and a hydrophobic nonionic surfactant was found to yield the highest concentrations of stable microbubbles (3 X 10(9) bubbles mL(-1)) in the size range or 0.7 to 20 mum. he specific surface areas of the microbubble suspensions were in the range of 50 cm(2) mL(-1), and specific air volumes were >0.07 mL mL(-1). For 1 pore volume of injected bubble suspension, effluent recoveries of 100, 80, and 30% were achieved from columns of coarse (415-500 mum), medium (150-212 mum), and fine (53-106 mum) sands, respectively. Effluent recovery in the fine sand column increased to 63% following a 3 pore volume injection. Microbubble generation and injection under pressure were shown to minimize microbubble loss due to gas dissolution. Results from the modeling suggest that retention of microbubbles could be adequately described by filtration theory.

ID CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; TAP-WATER; COMMODITY
AB From the 1940s until 2015, while the French population grew 60%, the bottled water per capita consumption grew 2350%, from 6L to about 140L per person, per year. These figures rank France as one of the biggest bottled water markets in the world. Contrary to other top water markets, most of France's population has access to good quality tap water, which is trusted and consumed by most of its citizens. I explain this paradox, analyzing the creation and development of the French bottled water market. Based on data on the history of mineral water, marketing, and consumer behavior, I describe the origins and development of this market, highlighting the most important historical events and laws that created the economic and political conditions that shaped its structure and regulation. I analyze the influence of food and beverage groups like Nestle, Danone, and Group Castel/Alma (Neptune), demonstrating how these companies radically reshaped the market structure through aggressive strategies of merger and acquisitions of smaller companies and their brands. I also examine how their marketing strategies and actions transformed the cultural meaning of water, gradually shifting from a banal, life-essential good into a commodity that connects to a range of different cultural images, lifestyles, and changing consumers' tastes and behavior. I also situate bottled water markets into the wider debate of water politics and policy. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Subsurface flow from a hillslope can be described by hydraulic groundwater theory, as formulated by the Boussinesq equation.  Solution of its linear version brings out some of the essential features of this phenomenon.  Arbitrary inputs can be accommodated by simple convolution of the sudden drawdown problem.  The relative magnitude of the driving mechanisms, namely the streamwise pressure gradient, resulting in diffusion and gravity (i.e., slope), resulting in advection, can be determined by a simple dimensionless parameter.

AB The paper reports a laboratory study of drag forces exerted on aquatic vegetation and their coupling with flow turbulence. The experiments were conducted in a 12.5 m long and 0.30 m wide flume, using five different freshwater plant species (Ranunculus penicillatus, Fontinalis antipyretica, Myriophyllum alterniflorum, Glyceria fluitans, and Callitriche stagnalis). Velocity components and drag forces were measured using two acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADV) and a specially designed drag measurement device. Drag fluctuations exerted on the plants appeared to be closely related to the ambient turbulence, especially to large-scale turbulent structures. The enhanced turbulent energy downstream from the plants was associated with wake generation, with its magnitude controlled by plant morphology reconfiguration. Frequency spectra of drag fluctuations reveal a frequency range where they follow a power law that can be parameterized using plant and flow properties. The rescaled spectral functions are shown to match the collected data reasonably well. In addition, drag-velocity cross-correlation analyses enabled the estimation of the location of the resultant drag force, which can be interpreted as an integral measure of plant adaptation to the flow. The results revealed different degrees of adaptation of the plants to flowing water, with Fontinalis and Glyceria showing the best hydrodynamic performances, i.e., lower levels of turbulence and drag generation.

AB A geometric simulation method was used to develop a three-dimensional, highly detailed synthetic representation of point bar sediments in the Wabash River system. Geometric simulation methods, in comparison to well-known second-order stochastic methods, offer the advantage of being more closely related to depositional processes, which are often similarly conceptualized (i.e., described in terms of shapes of discrete bed forms, trends in grain size, and spatial relationships of defined geologic facies). Multiple scales of geometric variation were defined within a sedimentologically prescribed framework, and shapes of discrete geometric elements were established at each scale. The selected shapes were based on published field studies including sedimentological bed form studies and trench studies in active point bar sediments. The parameterization of the shapes allowed for random variability of the shape descriptors; discrete shapes were then generated and assimilated by computer. Hydraulic conductivity values were assigned to the discrete elements based on reports of observed variations in grain size and field measurements of hydraulic conductivity. The synthetic model, referred to as a numerical aquifer, is being used as the basis for extensive numerical experimentation to study the relationship between natural spatial structure and subsurface flow and transport.

ID ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; SALINITY
AB The feasibility of soil water content measurement using electromagnetic induction was investigated in an arid region of southern New Mexico. Soil water measurements were taken monthly with a neutron probe at 65 equally spaced stations along a 1950-m transect. At the same time, noninvasive electrical conductivity measurements of the soil were taken with a Geonics EM-31 ground conductivity meter. Using 16 months of measurements, we found a linear relationship exists between bulk soil electrical conductivity and total soil water content in the top 1.5 m of the profile. A simple linear regression model was developed to describe the relationship between soil water content and bulk soil electrical conductivity. The spatial and temporal accuracy of the regression model is addressed as well as the total number of neutron access tubes needed to accurately calibrate the model. By comparison with the neutron scattering method the electromagnetic induction method is quite accurate for the prediction of water content changes over time. The speed and ease of use combined with the accuracy of the measurements make the ground conductivity meter a valuable tool for rapid, noninvasive soil water measurements.

AB Three geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) models are investigated. These GIUHs were derived as a function of watershed geomorphological characteristics. The geomorphological input parameters of the models were determined for 10 basins in Indiana, USA. The three GIUH models were used to simulate 187 observed runoff hydrographs of these basins. The non-measurable velocity parameters of the GIUH models were optimized and the relationships between them were investigated. The results of the investigation show that the velocity parameters of the three models are correlated. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB [1] The general belief that dune sands in arid regions are not likely to generate runoff and that runoff necessitates wet conditions is examined. Runoff generation was measured within an arid dune field in the western Negev Desert, Israel, during 1990 - 1994 on 16 plots (1.2-6.6 m(2)), constructed along a continuum of crust-covered crust. The relationships between chlorophyll a and carbohydrates of the microbiotic crust and runoff yield were studied. Whereas chlorophyll a (15-45 mg m(-2)) and carbohydrates (4.9-17.6 g m(-2)) of the cyanobacterial crusts showed positive linear relationships with runoff coefficients, a significant reduction in runoff yield was obtained once the moss-dominated crust (with 53 - 54.5 mg m(-2) chlorophyll a and 28.5 - 28.9 g m(-2) of carbohydrates), which inhabited the wettest habitat within the dune field, was also included in the analysis. Contrary to previous assumptions that an increase in runoff generation occurs on arid and semiarid sand dunes in wet climates, wet climates may lead to the establishment of moss-dominated crusts that in turn decrease runoff yield.

AB Precipitation and streamwater were analysed weekly for 18O in seven tributaries and five main stem sites of a 2100 km2 catchment; 60% of it is upland in character. Precipitation 18O followed seasonal patterns ranging from -20 parts per thousand in winter to -4 parts per thousand in summer. Seasonality was also evident in stream waters, though much more damped. Mean transit times (MTTs) were estimated using 18O input-output relationships in a convolution integral with a gamma distribution. The MTTs were relatively similar (528-830 days): tributaries exhibited a greater range, being shorter in catchments with montane topography and hydrologically responsive soils, and longer where catchments have significant water storage. Along the main stem, MTTs increased modestly from 621 to 741 days. This indicates that montane headwaters are the dominant sources of runoff along the main stem of the river system. Models suggest that around 10% of runoff has transit times of less than two weeks during higher flows whilst older (10-year old) water sustains low flows contributing around 5% of runoff.

AB Existing stochastic models of unsaturated flow and transport are usually developed using the simple Gardner-Russo constitutive relationship though it is generally accepted that the more complex van Genuchten and Brooks-Corey relationships may perform better in describing experimental data. In this paper, we develop first-order stochastic models for gravity-dominated flow in second-order stationary media with both the Brooks-Corey and the Gardner-Russo constitutive relationships. These models also account for the spatial variability in effective water content, while the spatial variability is generally neglected in most existing stochastic models. Analytical solutions are obtained for the case of one-dimensional gravity-dominated flow. On the basis of the solutions, we illustrate the differences between results from these two constitutive models through some one-dimensional examples. It is found that the impacts of the constitutive models on the statistical moments of suction head, effective water content, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, and velocity depend on the saturation ranges. For example, the mean head and the mean effective water content for the Brooks-Corey model differ in a great manner with their counterparts for the Gardner-Russo model near the dry and wet limits while the differences are small at the intermediate range of saturation. This finding is confirmed with some two-dimensional examples. It:is also found that the Brook-Corey model has certain advantages over the Gardner-Russo model in analyzing unsaturated flow in heterogeneous media. For example, the stochastic model developed based on the Brooks-Corey function requires the coefficient of variation of head and soil parameter "alpha(BC)" to be small (much less than 1), whereas that based on the Gardner-Russo function assumes the one-point cross covariance of head and alpha(GR) to be small (much less than 1). Illustrative examples reveal that the latter condition may be violated because the one-point covariance is found to increase rapidly to beyond unity as the soil becomes dry, whereas the former may be readily satisfied.

AB An analytical tool which facilitates the analysis of stochastic groundwater problems without resorting to Monte Carlo analysis can be developed using an approach analogous to that used in the field of applied mathematics to investigate the propagation of waves in random media. The fundamental assumption of this approach is that the rondom part of the porous medium property is small compared to the non-random part. This assumption allows us to treat the problem of solving a partial differential equation with stochastic coefficients using perturbation theory.

AB Winter mean 700-hectoPascal (hPa) height anomalies, representing the average atmospheric circulation during the snow season, are compared with annual streamflow measured at 140 streamgauges in the western United States. Correlation and anomaly pattern analyses are used to identify relationships between winter mean atmospheric circulation and temporal and spatial variability in annual streamflow. Results indicate that variability in winter mean 700-Hpa height anomalies accounts for a statistically significant portion of the temporal variability in annual streamflow in the western United States. In general, above-average annual streamflow is associated with negative winter mean 700-Hpa height anomalies over the eastern North Pacific Ocean and/or the western United States. The anomalies produce an anomalous flow of moist air from the eastern North Pacific Ocean into the western United States that increases winter precipitation and snowpack accumulations, and subsequently streamflow. Winter mean 700-hPa height anomalies also account for statistically significant differences in spatial distributions of annual streamflow. As part of this study, winter mean atmospheric circulation patterns for the 40 years analysed were classified into five winter mean 700-hPa height anomaly patterns. These patterns are related to statistically significant and physically meaningful differences in spatial distributions of annual streamflow.

AB Solutions for steady hillside seepage depend on an accurate estimate of the water table location, before any of the flow parameters can be quantified. In this paper, solutions are obtained for hillslopes subjected to low recharge, using the series methods described in a companion paper (Adv. Water Resour., 19(2) (1996) 63-73). The recharge rate is bounded above, when the upstream boundary is not a vertical, impermeable dyke. The practical consequences of exceeding the maximum recharge rate are examined, for realistic hillslope geometry and recharge rates, and some modifications to the theory are suggested.

AB Crystalline rocks are often heterogeneous geological materials that contain numerous fractures of various attitudes and scales. Although considerable advances have been made in simulation of fluid flow through fractured media, our knowledge of seepage flow with free surfaces in fracture networks remains to be an outstanding issue. In this paper, the partial differential equations (PDEs) defined on the whole fracture network domain are formulated for free-surface seepage flow problems by an extension of Darcy's law. A variational inequality (VI) formulation is then presented, and the proof of the equivalence between the PDE and VI formulations is given. Since the boundary conditions involving the flux components in the PDE formulation become the natural conditions in the VI formulation, the difficulty of choosing the trial functions for numerical solutions is significantly reduced and the locations of seepage points can be easily determined. On the basis of the discrete VI, the corresponding numerical procedure for unconfined seepage analysis of discrete fracture network has been developed. The results from three typical examples demonstrate the validity and capability of the procedure for unconfined seepage problems involving complicated fracture networks. Citation: Jiang, Q., C.

AB [1] We describe a study undertaken to investigate the potential of the geotechnical centrifuge as an experimental tool to study dense nonaqueous phase liquid ( DNAPL) behavior in fracture systems. Scaling laws are developed that link observations made in a centrifuge model of a fracture system to the full-scale problem ( prototype). Centrifuge experiments carried out in synthetic fractures, described by smooth-walled vertical capillary tubes, demonstrate for the first time that the geotechnical centrifuge can be used to model DNAPL transport in a simplified system provided that inertial forces are negligible in both the model and the prototype. Experiments also confirm, as predicted by Kueper and McWhorter [1991], that DNAPL invades a smooth-walled, vertical fracture when the DNAPL pool height at its entrance reaches its entry pressure. A simple mathematical model describing the displacement of the DNAPL-water interface is also presented. The predictions of this model and the experimental data are in good agreement with each other in the lower half of an invaded fracture. However, at the early stages of DNAPL invasion into the fracture, our observed DNAPL-water interface velocities are slower than predicted by the model. We attribute this to an apparent dependence of the local capillary pressure on the interface displacement velocity.

TI APPROACHES TO GROUNDWATER QUALITY PROTECTION IN THE WESTERN
   UNITED-STATES
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Groundwater sources supply about 38% of all water uses in the 19 western states.  Most attention has focused on withdrawals from these sources but, in recent years, concerns have been raised about the quality of groundwater.  At the federal level, several laws address aspects of groundwater quality but protection of this resource has been left primarily to the states.  Western state groundwater quality protection programs were comprehensively surveyed relating to six aspects:  assessment of existing groundwater quality, levels of protection established, controls placed on sources of contamination, use of special management areas, coordination among the involved agencies, and program enforcement.  The survey revealed several promising approaches in each of these areas in the western states which are set forth in the paper.  Most of these approaches have been established in recent years, reflecting the greatly increased state attention to groundwater quality protection.  It is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of particular approaches.  In general the western states are taking a more active role in groundwater quality protection, and several states recently have established comprehensive programs for this purpose.  Others, however, are still considering approaches to protection of groundwater quality and may find the discussion in this paper of some use.

AB [1] Estimation of effective/average soil hydraulic properties for large land areas is an outstanding issue in hydrologic modeling. The goal of this study is to provide flow-specific rules and guidelines for upscaling soil hydraulic properties in an areally heterogeneous field. In this study, we examined the impact of areal heterogeneity of soil hydraulic parameters on soil ensemble behavior for steady state evaporation and infiltration. The specific objectives of this study are (1) to address the impact of averaging methods of shape parameters and parameter correlation on ensemble behavior of steady state flow in an areally heterogeneous field and (2) to investigate the effectiveness of the "average parameters'' in terms of the degree of correlation between hydraulic property parameters for the steady state evaporation and infiltration in unsaturated soil. Using an analytical solution of Richards' equation, the ensemble characteristics and flow dynamics based on average hydraulic property parameters are studied for evaporation and infiltration. Using various flow and average scenarios, we illustrated the resulting differences among the various averaging schemes. For vertical evaporation and infiltration the use of a geometric mean value for the shape parameter alpha of Gardner-Russo model and Brooks-Corey model and arithmetic mean value for the saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s simulates the ensemble flow behavior the best. The efficacy of the "average parameters'' depends on the flow condition and the degree of correlation between the hydraulic property parameters. With the alpha and K-s parameters perfectly correlated, the "average parameters'' were found to be generally most effective. The correlation between the hydraulic conductivity K-s and the parameter alpha results in an ensemble soil behavior more like a sand.

ID GROUNDWATER-FLOW; CAPTURE ZONE; MODELS
AB A new theory is presented for groundwater flow in layered, anisotropic aquifers; flow must remain semi-confined. Two main approximations are made: (1) the aquifer consists of a number of horizontal, homogeneous layers, each with its own anisotropic transmissivity, and (2) the resistance to flow in the vertical direction is neglected. Analytic solutions are derived for the head and horizontal flow in each layer by use of a comprehensive transmissivity tensor. The vertical component of flow at the layer interfaces is computed analytically by vertical integration of the horizontal divergence. The theory is applied to both uniform flow and flow to a well; solutions may be superimposed. Flow in layered, anisotropic aquifers is three-dimensional when the anisotropy between layers differs. In the context of contaminant transport, the resulting three-dimensional flow field can be of great importance. Three-dimensional flow lines become especially complicated near pumping wells. In a two-layer aquifer, the flow lines to a well may be grouped into four bundles of spiraling flow lines, referred to as groundwater whirls. These whirls are bounded by two vertical planes that intersect at the well; horizontal flow along these planes is radial. For a well in a uniform flow field, the complications of the three-dimensional flow field are illustrated by the difficulties that are encountered in delineating the capture zone of the well.

DT Article
AB The impact of various water management alternatives, resulting from the construction of the La Vinuela reservoir system (Malaga, Spain), on the hydrological regime of the coastal aquifer of the Velez River has been analysed. In particular, steady-state simulations of the freshwater regime have been carried out under various possible management policies for this reservoir system. For this purpose, a finite element model was used, which was designed to take into account the relationship between the groundwater and surface water, the different hypotheses for the mixture of freshwater and saltwater, and the special treatment of the open boundaries of the aquifer at the coastline. The simulations consider average freshwater inputs as well as different water management and exploitation alternatives for surplus and deficit of freshwater. The accomplished simulations provide the phreatic levels, the active drainage network and the thicknesses of freshwater and saltwater as a result of the advance of the saltwater interface. The results of the simulations appear to be reliable according to the existing experimental data on the region. The simulation alternatives illustrate the main limitations of the aquifer for storing and transmitting freshwater, and preventing the advance of saltwater intrusion resulting from the exploitation by pumping in wells and water management policies in the La Vinuela reservoir system.

ID CHEMICAL PROCESS SYSTEMS
AB An urban fractured-rock aquifer system, where disposal of storm water is via 'soak holes' drilled directly into the top of fractured-rock basalt, has a highly dynamic nature where theories or knowledge to generate the model are still incomplete and insufficient. Therefore, formulating an accurate mechanistic model, usually based on first principles (physical and chemical laws, mass balance, and diffusion and transport, etc.), requires time- and money-consuming tasks.
   Instead of a human developing the mechanistic-based model, this paper presents an approach to automatic model evolution in genetic programming (GP) to model dynamic behaviour of groundwater level fluctuations affected by storm water infiltration. This GP evolves mathematical models automatically that have an understandable structure using function tree representation by methods of natural selection ('survival of the fittest') through genetic operators (reproduction, crossover. and mutation).
   The simulation results have shown that GP is not only capable of predicting the groundwater level fluctuation due to storm water infiltration but also provides insight into the dynamic behaviour of a partially known urban fractured-rock aquifer system by allowing knowledge extraction of the evolved models. Our results show that GP can work as a cost-effective modelling tool, enabling us to create prototype models quickly and inexpensively and assists us in developing accurate models in less time, even if we have limited experience and incomplete knowledge for an urban fractured-rock aquifer system affected by storm water infiltration.

AB Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia is the deepest and (by volume) largest lake on Earth. Among the most ancient lakes, it is home to thousands of endemic species. Lake Baikal is well-known for its water purity, especially its dominant deep-water layers, which consist of pristine, drinking-quality water and is inhabited by unique endemics with enormous biodiversity. But some coastal sites of this giant lake (mainly localized in isolated shallow bays and littoral zones close to settlements and industrial sites) are suffering from an environmental crisis that threatens the water's quality and the ecosystem it supports. As part of the global ecosystem, Lake Baikal is already facing significant impacts from global climate change, which, in turn, increase the risks and consequences of local anthropogenic effects. Although the lake is protected by federal law, human activities are nevertheless having a growing negative impact on its ecosystem. Political, economic, and social factors result in cascading natural consequences in water quality, coastal sustainability, pollution sinks, water level management, forest maintenance, fire control and biodiversity. While Lake Baikal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, known and valued around the world, it remains vulnerable to worsening threats that must be addressed if humanity is to preserve this unique ecosystem and its endemic species into the future.

AB An artificial neural network (ANN) is a flexible mathematical structure which is capable of identifying complex nonlinear relationships between input and output data sets. ANN models have been found useful and efficient, particularly in problems for which the characteristics of the processes are difficult to describe using physical equations. This study presents a new procedure (entitled linear least squares simplex, or LLSSIM) for identifying the structure and parameters of three-layer feed forward ANN models and demonstrates the potential of such models for simulating the nonlinear hydrologic behavior of watersheds. The nonlinear ANN model approach is shown to provide a better representation of the rainfall-runoff relationship of the medium-size Leaf River basin near Collins, Mississippi, than the linear ARMAX (autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs) time series approach or the conceptual SAC-SMA (Sacramento soil moisture accounting) model. Because the ANN approach presented here does not provide models that have Physically realistic components and parameters, it is by no means a substitute for conceptual watershed modeling. However, the ANN approach does provide a viable and effective alternative to the ARMAX time series approach for developing input-output simulation and forecasting models in situations that do not require modeling of the internal structure of the watershed.

AB The development of shale gas resources was made possible by the combination of horizontal drilling and high-volume hydraulic fracturing (fracking). Environmental concerns have been raised relative to shale gas production, especially potential impacts on groundwater. Fluids related to unconventional oil and gas (O&G) operations contain chemical compounds that can impact groundwater quality. Such impacts can occur due to (1) the infiltration of surface contaminant releases, (2) failures of the integrity of O&G wells, and (3) upward fluid migration from a shale/tight reservoir along preferential paths that can be natural (faults or fracture zone) or man-made (O&G wells). Surface releases represent the most probable mechanism leading to groundwater contamination. Improvements in O&G drilling operations under stringent regulations can minimize this risk. Experts identify O&G well integrity as the most challenging issue that may lead to groundwater contamination. Failure of casing and cement can lead to upward fluid flow within or outside O&G wells, especially of methane. Integrity failures leading to fluid migration to shallow fresh water aquifers or to the surface are well understood and can be detected and repaired, but this can be complex and costly. A few regulators now impose groundwater monitoring to detect impacts from integrity failures. Occurrences of communication with existing O&G wells from fracking operations have also led some regulators to impose rules aiming to avoid such potential fluid migration paths. There is an ongoing scientific debate regarding the potential for fluids to migrate upward from exploited shale gas units to aquifers through natural preferential paths.

AB Extensive explorations have been performed in the northern part of the island of Dugi Otok in the Adriatic Sea (Croatia) with the purpose of extraction of fresh and/or brackish water. The island is predominantly composed of karstified carbonate rocks of the Cretaceous age. The explorations included geological and hydrogeological mapping of the area, geophysical surveys (by means of the geoelectric tomography method, electrical resistivity sounding, and surface seismic refraction), exploratory core drilling, hydrochemical in situ and laboratory explorations, and the pumping test with the calculation of rock mass parameters. Based on the obtained results, it was concluded that it is possible to exploit the groundwater with a pumping quantity of 5 l/s without intrusion of salt water into the fresh-water tens. Choosing a pumping regime based on the parameters of the aquifer (rock mass hydraulic conductivity order of magnitude 10(-4)-10(-6) m/s), and knowing the parameters of the well, as well as the tidal efficiency, should reduce the possibility of intrusion to the minimum. Because of the systematic quality of the performed explorations and obtained results, the island of Dugi Otok can serve as a typical example for such kinds of exploration works on other karstic islands. Hydrogeological composition behaves partly according to Ghyben-Herzberg's law, but because of the nature of the karstic hydrogeological system, such a statement needs to be accepted approximately because of the highly complicated relationships.

AB Forest degradation, due mainly to poor management, is of increasing concern in Japan. Major ecosystem functions, such as biodiversity, productivity, and soil and water retention, are being lost or weakened in Japan's forests, especially in Japanese cypress (Hinoki; Chamaecyparis Obtusa Sieb.) plantations. Detecting forest degradation is critical to the restoration of the ecosystem in the Kochi area, but ground-based detection methods are labour intensive and difficult to implement in mountainous areas. In this study we examined the ecological characteristics (e. g. soil water content (SWC) and leaf water content) of degraded and healthy forests, based on in situ measurements and controlled experiments, and present a new method for mapping forest degradation based on remote sensing techniques. A field survey was carried out to record the locations and conditions of the degraded Japanese cypress plantations. Empirical relationships among the degraded plantation, SWC, fuel moisture content (FMC), and vegetation indices (VIs) were investigated by field survey and control experiments. We found that the SWC of the degraded Japanese cypress plantations was lower than that of the well-managed Japanese cypress plantations. We also found that the SWC, FMC, and VI are highly correlated (R > 0.80). In addition to the ground investigation, we used the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data and compared a number of VIs to determine their relationships to the biophysical/biochemical attributes of vegetation canopies. Our results showed that the ASTER thermal band was the most effective method used to detect degraded Japanese cypress plantations in the study area. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study evaluates an over-exploited aquifer (Balasor, India) and also explores the possibilities of sustainable management using several statistical approaches. First, bootstrap analysis indicates that groundwater pumping has resulted in the reduction of mean cultivated area as the average irrigation capacity per bore well dropped from 3.74 ha to 1.5 ha within a period of 10 years of operation. However, modelling the groundwater levels using the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) procedure showed no evidence of large-scale groundwater withdrawals. The derived models can be used for water table forecasting and also for infilling the missing observations. The empirical relationship among pumping test results indicated that well depth and aquifer thickness significantly influence the discharge from the aquifer. This discharge may have encouraged the resource-rich farmers to exploit the lower aquifer. Based on a contour plot, the zone of groundwater exploitation was estimated to vary from 25 to 60m below the surface. Therefore, a uniform aquifer exploitation policy needs to be implemented to curb the vertical competition in exploiting the aquifer and to develop sustainable management of the groundwater.

AB Groundwater samples were collected from 11 springs in Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in southern Nevada and seven springs from Death Valley National Park in eastern California. Concentrations of the major cations (Ca, Mg, Na and K) and 45 trace elements were determined in these groundwater samples. The resultant data were subjected to evaluation via the multivariate statistical technique principal components analysis (PCA), to investigate the chemical relationships between the Ash Meadows and Death Valley spring waters, to evaluate whether the results of the PCA support those of previous hydrogeological and isotopic studies and to determine if PCA can be used to help delineate potential groundwater flow patterns based on the chemical compositions of groundwaters. The results of the PCA indicated that groundwaters from the regional Paleozoic carbonate aquifers tall of the Ash Meadows springs and four springs from the Furnace Creek region of Death Valley) exhibited strong statistical associations, whereas other Death Valley groundwaters were chemically different. The results of the PCA support earlier studies.,where potentiometric head levels, delta(18)O and delta D, geological relationships and rare earth element data were used to evaluate groundwater flow, which suggest groundwater flows from Ash Meadows to the Furnace Creek springs in Death Valley. The PCA suggests that Furnace Creek groundwaters are moderately concentrated Ash Meadows groundwater, reflecting longer aquifer residence times for the Furnace Creek groundwaters, Moreover, PCA indicates that groundwater may flow from springs in the region surrounding Scotty's Castle:in Death Valley National Park, to a spring discharging on the valley floor. The study indicates that PCA:may provide rapid and relatively cost-effective methods to assess possible groundwater flow regimes' in systems-that have not been previously investigated.

AB Resolving the hydrodynamic control of retention is an important step in predictive modeling of transport of sorbing tracers in fractured rock. The statistics of the transport resistance parameter beta [T/L] and the related effective active specific surface area s(f) [1/L] are studied in a crystalline rock volume on a 100 m scale. Groundwater flow and advective transport are based on generic boundary conditions and realistic discrete fracture networks inferred from the Laxemar site, southeast Sweden. The overall statistics of beta are consistent with statistics of the water residence time tau; the moments of beta vary linearly with distance, at least up to 100 m. The correlation between log tau and log beta is predominantly linear, however, there is significant dispersion; the parameter s(f) strongly depends on the assumed hydraulic law (theoretical cubic or empirical quadratic). Fast and slow trajectories/segments in the network determine the shape of the beta distribution that cannot be reproduced by infinitely divisible model over the entire range; the low value range and median can be reproduced reasonably well with the tempered one-sided stable density using the exponent in the range 0.35-0.7. The low percentiles of the beta distribution seems to converge to a Fickian type of behavior from a 50 to 100 m scale.

AB This study extends the single parameter precipitation elasticity of streamflow index into a two parameter climate elasticity index, as a function of both precipitation and temperature, in order to assess climatic effects on annual streamflow. Application of the proposed index to two basins indicates that the single parameter precipitation elasticity index may give a general relationship between precipitation and streamflow in some cases, but that it cannot reflect the complicated non-linear relationship among streamflow, precipitation and temperature. For example, for the Spokane River basin the climate elasticity of streamflow index varies from 2.4 to 0.2, for a precipitation increase of 20%, as temperature varies from 1 degrees C lower to 1.8 degrees C higher than the long term mean. Thus a 20% precipitation increase may result in a streamflow increase of 48% if the temperature is 1 degrees C lower but only a 4% increase if the temperature is 1.8 degrees C higher than the long-term mean. The proposed method can be applied to other basins to assess potential climate change effects on annual streamflow. The results of the two case studies can inform planning of long-term basin water management strategies taking into account global change scenarios.

AB A dynamic-stochastic model for flood forecasting based on the Kalman filtering theory is described. To reduce the computational time that the Kalman filter involves, this model is performed using the reduced rank square root algorithm, which approximates the covariance matrix by a matrix of lower rank. By using the special banded structure of the Jacobian matrix of the discretization of the Saint Venant equations by the four points Preissman scheme, this algorithm is made computationally efficient for a flood routing model. The noise terms are treated as coloured noise processes, with one term for every grid element. An application to estimate the state of a one-channel reach is described.

AB Although the spatial heterogeneity of throughfall water (TF) under forest canopies has been related to vegetation structure in several forest types, few reports have been made of the driving factors of small-scale TF variability in deciduous stands. Therefore, the spatial variability of the amount of TF water under one dominant beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) tree was quantified in high temporal and spatial resolution over a 2-year period to examine the temporal stability of spatial TF variability and to relate spatial TF patterns to canopy cover determined photographically above each TF collector (n = 48). The spatial variability of TF was significantly higher during the leafed periods (coefficient of variation (CV) = 18%) than during the leafless periods (CV = 8%), and a strong negative relationship was observed between the CV of event TF and the TF fraction of rainfall in the open field. Geostatistical analysis showed that the cumulative TF water during the leafed periods was spatially correlated up to a distance of 3-4 m. There was a significant temporal stability of spatial TF patterns in the growing periods and in the dormant periods, but patterns differed largely between the two periods of the year. TF water during the growing periods significantly decreased with increasing canopy cover above the sampling locations (r = -0.54, p = 0.014, n = 20), but was more closely correlated with branch cover (r = -0.77, p < 0.001). However, the spatial pattern of TF during defoliated conditions was not related to the measured variation in branch cover. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate flow and solute transport in a heterogeneous unsaturated soil under gravity-driven flow conditions using a direct simulation Monte Carlo method. We account for the cross correlation between the heterogeneous fields of unsaturated flow parameters representing a silty loam. We determine through particle tracking the statistical moments of the travel time distribution for nonpoint injection of a conservative tracer. The one-particle mean and variance characterize the mean arrival time and spreading of solute integrated over an entire horizontal cross section of the domain, whereas the two-particle semivariogram characterizes the spreading observed at individual points. From these quantities we derive macrodispersivities and effective dispersivities. The latter reflect solute dilution. Owing to the nonlinearity of unsaturated flow the dispersivity values at a given depth vary with the mean infiltration rate. The two-particle semivariogram hardly differs from the one-particle variance of travel time at low infiltration rates, whereas dilution and macrodispersion rates differ significantly at high infiltration rates. We compare the dispersivities determined through particle tracking with approximations from linear stochastic theories based on the covariance of the Eulerian velocity field [Dagan, 1988; Fiori and Dagan, 2000]. These linear stochastic theories slightly underestimate both dispersivity types. We present parametric models for the two types of dispersivities as function of the infiltration rate and the depth.

AB The vertical and lateral profiles of temporal variations in soil moisture are important for understanding the hydrological process along hillside transects. In this study, relationships among measured soil moistures were explored to configure the hydrological contributions of different flowpaths. All the measured soil moistures included a common stochastic structure because rainfall, the hydrometeological driver, is the main factor that determines the soil moisture response feature, and the infiltration process through the topsoil at a shallow depth is also common in all measured soil moisture histories. Therefore, the relationships between the measured series are also affected by both rainfall and topsoil infiltration. The common stochastic structure of the soil moisture series was removed via a prewhitening procedure. A systematic analysis procedure is presented to delineate the exclusive causal relationships among multiple soil moisture measurements. A monitoring system based on multiplexed time domain reflectometry was used to obtain soil moisture time series along two transects on a steep hillslope during the rainy season. The application of the proposed method for monitoring points in two adjacent locations provided 8, 12, 14, and 13, 16, 22 causal relationships for vertical, lateral in parallel, and diagonal directions, respectively, along the two transects. The point-based contributions of the internal flowpath can be evaluated as the correlation is normalized in the context of inflow and outflow. The hydrological processes in the soil layer, vertical flow, lateral flow, downslope recharge, and return flow were quantified, and the relative importance of each hydrological component was determined to improve our understanding of the hydrological processes along the two transects of the study area.

AB The closed-form solution for the hydraulic head, derived for the radial groundwater flow equation subject to the constant-head boundary condition at the wellbore, is in an integral form that covers an integration range from zero to infinity. The integral is difficult to evaluate due to the integrand not only consisting of the product and the square of the Bessel functions but also having a singularity at the origin. A unified numerical method is proposed to evaluate the solution with accuracy to five decimal places and for very wide ranges of dimensionless distances and times. This approach includes a singularity removal scheme, Newton's method, the Gaussian quadrature, and Shanks' method. It gives the dimensionless heads in tabular forms with better accuracy while comparing to those given by other approaches.
   A formula describing the flow rate across the wellbore, derived by the authors based on Darcy's law, is proved to equal those presented by Jaeger [Proc Royal Soc Edinburgh 61 (1942) 223] and Jacob and Lohman [Am Geo Union 33 (4) (1952) 559]. The same singularity removal scheme and the Gaussian quadrature are also employed to evaluate the wellbore flow rate. Computed values of dimensionless flow rate versus dimensionless time expressed in tabular forms are also correct to five decimal places. Both the tabular results of dimensionless hydraulic head and dimensionless flow rate may be useful in engineering applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lake-water quality is highly dependent on the landscape characteristics in its respective watershed. In this study, we investigated the relationships between lake-water quality and landscape composition and configuration within the watershed in the Yangtze River basin of China. Water quality variables, including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), Secchi depth (SD), NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, TN, TP, chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and trophic state index (TSI), were collected from 16 lakes during the period of 20012003. Landscape composition (i.e. the percentage of vegetation, agriculture, water, urban, and bare land) and landscape configuration metrics, including number of patches (NP), patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI), edge density (ED), mean patch area (MPA), mean shape index (MSI), contagion (CONTAG), patch cohesion index (COHESION), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and aggregation index (AI), were calculated for each lake's watershed. Results revealed that the percentage of agriculture was negatively related to NO2-, TN, TP, Chl-a concentrations, and TSI, while the percentage of urban was significantly correlated with EC, NH4+, and CODMn concentrations. Among landscape-level configuration metrics, only ED showed significant relationships with TN, TP concentrations, and TSI. However, at the class level, the PD, LPI, ED, and AI of agriculture and urban land uses were significantly correlated with two or more water quality variables. This study suggests that, for a given total area, large and clustered agricultural or urban patches in the watershed may have a greater impact on lake-water quality than small and scattered ones.

AB Momentum transport equations for laminar incompressible Newtonian flow through a two-dimensional porous medium are derived.  The modelling is based on volume averaging concept.  A rectangular representation of fluid-solid interfaces renders the transport equations applicable over the entire porosity range from zero through unity.  Non-linear effects in the velocity-pressure gradient relationship are introduced through consideration of flow development along solid surfaces within the porous medium.  The results are also applicable to crossflow through a bundle of parallel but arbitrarily scattered tubes.

AB A frequency analysis approach was used to investigate the hydraulic connectivity between streams and aquifers, by comparing daily percentiles of streamflow and rainfall. Three Australian streams were examined - a dominantly gaining stream (Wilsons River, NSW), a dominantly gaining stream modified by significant water extraction (Ovens River, Victoria) and a dominantly losing stream (Mooki River, NSW). For the gaining stream examples, a tag is observed between the seasonal peak in the low-flow percentile curves and the seasonal peak in the daily rainfall percentile curve. Cross-correlation was used to calculate the time-shift that provides the best fit between the streamflow and rainfall percentile curves. There is a good correlation (r(2) > 0.8) between the reference rainfall percentile curve and the shifted streamflow percentile curves for gaining streams. The tags evident between the rainfall and streamflow percentile curves represent the processes of first replenishing catchment storages (such as soil moisture and groundwater) and subsequent release to the stream. This is largely a function of catchment hydrogeology as well as climate, notably the magnitude and regularity of rainfall events. Catchment size is not a controlling factor. Analysis of these tags provides insights into the dynamics of groundwater recharge, storage and release. Changes in the tag times over the flow percentiles can reflect changes in the dominant catchment storage contributing to streamflow. For the Wilsons River, the contribution from a groundwater system with longer flow paths increases at lower flow percentiles. This can be critical when protecting minimum streamflows, as near-stream groundwater flow may not be the only determining factor. The impact of water extraction can be recognised in this analysis. For the Ovens River, streamflow deficits relative to the rainfall percentile curve correspond to the summer period of high irrigation demand. Such a deficit was also observed for the Wilsons River when only post-development monitoring was used in the analysis. For the losing stream example of the Mooki River, the relationship between the streamflow and rainfall percentile curves was poor due to the significant number of no-flow days and much greater variability in the gauging record. This is because the recharge component of rainfall is not returned as streamflow over the year and a portion of streamflow can become aquifer leakage. Hence, the calculated tags derived from this analysis have no hydrological significance for losing streams. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID PRESSURE; FIELD
AB Two-phase (air-water) flow experiments were conducted in horizontal artificial fractures. The fractures were between glass plates that were either smooth or artificially roughened by gluing a layer of glass beads to them. One smooth fracture with an aperture of 1 mm and three rough fractures, one with the two surfaces in contact and two without contact, were studied. For both types of fractures, the flow structures are similar to those observed in two-phase flow in a pipe, with structures (bubbles, fingering bubbles, films, and drops) depending on the gas and liquid flow rates. The pressure gradients measured for different liquid and gas velocities were interpreted by three models. First, using Darcy's law leads to relative permeability curves similar to conventional ones for porous media. However, these curves depend not only on saturation but also on flow rates. This effect is caused by inertial forces which are not included in this approach. Second, the standard approach for two-phase flow in pipes (Lockhart and Martinelli's equation) agrees with experimental results, at least for small pressure gradients. Finally, the best fit was obtained by treating the two phases as one homogeneous phase. All the properties are averaged, and the pressure drop is deduced from an empirical correlation between the two-phase Reynolds number and the friction factor.

AB Loss of top soil and subsequent filling up of reservoirs in much of the lands with variable relief in developing countries degrades environmental resources necessary for subsistence. In the Ethiopia highlands, sediment mobilization from rain-fed agricultural fields is one of the leading factors causing land degradation. Sediment rating curves, produced from long-term sediment concentration and discharge data, attempt to predict suspended sediment concentration variations, which exhibit a distinct shift with the progression of the rainy season. In this paper, we calculate sediment rating curves and examine this shift in concentration for three watersheds in which rain-fed agriculture is practiced to differing extents. High sediment concentrations with low flows are found at the beginning of the rainy season of the semi-monsoonal climate, while high flows and low sediment concentrations occur at the end of the rainy season. Results show that a reasonably unique set of rating curves were obtained by separating biweekly data into early, mid, and late rainfall periods and by making adjustments for the ratio of plowed cropland. The shift from high to low concentrations suggests that diminishing sediment supply and dilution from greater base flow during the end of the rainfall period play important roles in characterizing changing sediment concentrations during the rainy season.

AB Discharge in many rivers is often fed by outflow from a shallow groundwater reservoir. It is becoming clear that the outflow from this aquifer is not linearly proportional to storage as is commonly assumed in many algorithms. Numerical analysis of flow recession curves from about 100 river gauging stations instead reveals a nonlinear relationship between baseflow, Q, and storage, S, for which the equation S = aQ(b) was adopted. Values of the exponent b are found by calibration to be between 0 and 1 but with a high concentration around 0.5, which is in accordance with the findings of other studies and theoretical approaches yielding b = 0.5 for unconfined aquifers and relating the coefficient a to catchment properties, primarily area and shape of basin, pore volume and transmissivity. This non-linear reservoir function is proposed as a more realistic alternative to the linear reservoir function.
   The relatively fast response of groundwater flow to rainfall is mainly a result of the increase of hydraulic head of the groundwater reservoir accelerating the exfiltration of 'old', pre-event water into the river bed. As fissure and pore volumes communicate hydraulically, it appears physically reasonable to model the system by one non-linear reservoir for catchments, or parts of them, instead of applying independent parallel linear reservoirs. The non-linear reservoir algorithms are supported by an analytical derivation. They are extended for the automatic separation of baseflow from a time-series of daily discharge in rivers and the computation of storage and effective recharge of groundwater in river basins by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. The time-series obtained allow the identification and quantification of long-term changes to the water balance. Relationships between computed groundwater storage and observed groundwater level can also be established. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Recent developments in hydrological modelling of river basins are focused on prediction in ungauged basins, which implies the need to improve relationships between model parameters and easily-obtainable information, such as satellite images, and to test the transferability of model parameters. A large-scale distributed hydrological model is described, which has been used in several large river basins in Brazil. The model parameters are related to classes of physical characteristics, such as soil type, land use, geology and vegetation. The model uses two basin space units: square grids for flow direction along the basin and GRU-group response units-which are hydrological classes of the basin physical characteristics for water balance. Expected ranges of parameter values are associated with each of these classes during the model calibration. Results are presented of the model fitting in the Taquari-Antas River basin in Brazil (26 000 km(2) and II flow gauges). Based on this fitting, the model was then applied to the Upper Uruguay River basin (52 000 km), having similar physical conditions, without any further calibration, in order to test the transferability of the model. The results in the Uruguay basin were compared with recorded flow data and showed relatively small errors, although a tendency to underestimate mean flows was found.

AB Nitrification and denitrification kinetics in sediment perfusion cores were numerically modeled and compared to experiments on cores from the Shingobee River MN, USA. The experimental design incorporated mixing groundwater discharge with stream water penetration into the cores, which provided a well-defined, one-dimensional simulation of in situ hydrologic conditions. Ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) concentration gradients suggested the upper region of the cores supported coupled nitrification dentrification, where groundwater-derived NH4+ was first oxidised to NO3- then subsequently reduced via denitrification to N-2. Nitrification and denitrification were modeled using a Crank-Nicolson finite difference approximation to a one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation. Both processes were modeled using first-order reaction kinetics because substrate concentrations (NH4+ and NO3) were much smaller than published Michaelis constants. Rate coefficients for nitrification and denitrification ranged from 0.2 to 15.8 h(-1) and 0.02 to 8.0 h(-1), respectively. The rate constants followed an Arrhenius relationship between 7.5 and 22 degreesC. Activation energies for nitrification and denitrification were 162 and 97.3 kJ/mol, respectively. Seasonal NH4+ concentration patterns in the Shingobee River were accurately simulated from the relationship between perfusion core temperature and NH4+ flux to the overlying water. The simulations suggest that NH4+ in groundwater discharge is controlled by sediment nitrification that, consistent with its activation energy, is strongly temperature dependent.

AB Inequalities in conditions of access to water are emblematic of contemporary urban life and have long been at the center of urban scholarship. This paper considers the theoretical and empirical potential of a focus on the everyday as a contribution to critical urban water studies. Drawing on research in Political Ecology and Critical Institutionalism, we focus on the intersection of everyday urbanism and water to reflect on whether such perspectives can further understandings of socio-natural inequalities and "real" governance challenges in the urban waterscape. We suggest that a focus on the everyday brings attention to the hybrid arrangements that constitute urban waterscapes and offers new insights to the polycentric nature of water governance, agency, and everyday urban struggles. However, we also outline limitations of these studies in unpacking the concept of the everyday and in capturing the practices through which everyday life is constituted. We explore the potential of an engagement with Practice Theory as a sensitizing lens for developing grounded understandings of everyday life, its constituent practices, and how these change over time. Concurrently, we argue that Practice Theory could be strengthened by drawing on critical approaches that explain everyday urban governance through: (1) the linking of practices to broader patterns of inequality; (2) the multiple social identities of practitioners and the variability in their exercise of agency; (3) the role of institutions as crucial mediating mechanisms and the processes through which practices become enduring institutional arrangements. We, thus, conclude that these approaches are complementary rather than competing.

AB The impact of three-dimensional subsurface heterogeneity in the saturated hydraulic conductivity on hillslope runoff generated by excess infiltration (so-called Hortonian runoff) is examined. A fully coupled, parallel subsurface-overland flow model is used to simulate runoff from an idealized hillslope. Ensembles of correlated, Gaussian random fields of saturated hydraulic conductivity are used to create uncertainty in spatial structure. A large number of cases are simulated in a parametric manner with the variance of the hydraulic conductivity varied over orders of magnitude. These cases include rainfall rates above, equal and below the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity distribution. These cases are also compared to theoretical representations of runoff production based on simple assumptions regarding (1) the rainfall rate and the value of hydraulic conductivity in the surface cell using a spatially-indiscriminant approach; and (2) a percolation-theory type approach to incorporate so-called runon. Simulations to test the ergodicity of hydraulic conductivity on hillslope runoff are also performed. Results show that three-dimensional stochastic representations of the subsurface hydraulic conductivity can create shallow perching, which has an important effect on runoff behavior that is different than previous two-dimensional analyses. The simple theories are shown to be very poor predictors of the fraction of saturated area that might runoff due to excess infiltration. It is also shown that ergodicity is reached only for a large number of integral scales (similar to 30) and not achieved for cases where the rainfall rate is less than the geometric mean of the saturated hydraulic conductivity.

AB When constructing a hydrological model at the macroscale (e.g., watershed scale), the structure of this model will inherently be uncertain because of many factors, including the lack of a robust hydrological theory at that scale. In this work, we assume that a suitable conceptual model structure for the hydrologic system has already been determined; that is, the system boundaries have been specified, the important state variables and input and output fluxes to be included have been selected, the major hydrological processes and geometries of their interconnections have been identified, and the continuity equation (mass balance) has been assumed to hold. The remaining structural identification problem that remains, then, is to select the mathematical form of the dependence of the output on the inputs and state variables, so that a computational model can be constructed for making simulations and/or predictions of the system input-state-output behavior. The conventional approach to this problem is to preassume some fixed (and possibly erroneous) mathematical forms for the model output equations. We show instead how Bayesian data assimilation can be used to directly estimate (construct) the form of these mathematical relationships such that they are statistically consistent with macroscale measurements of the system inputs, outputs, and (if available) state variables. The resulting model has a stochastic rather than deterministic form and thereby properly represents both what we know (our certainty) and what we do not know (our uncertainty) about the underlying structure and behavior of the system. Further, the Bayesian approach enables us to merge prior beliefs in the form of preassumed model equations with information derived from the data to construct a posterior model. As a consequence, in regions of the model space for which observational data are available, the errors in preassumed mathematical form of the model can be corrected, improving model performance. For regions where no such data are available the "prior'' theoretical assumptions about the model structure and behavior will dominate. The approach, entitled Bayesian estimation of structure, is used to estimate water balance models for the Leaf River Basin, Mississippi, at annual, monthly, and weekly time scales, conditioned on the assumption of a simple single-state-variable conceptual model structure. Inputs to the system are uncertain observed precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, and outputs are estimated probability distributions of actual evapotranspiration and streamflow discharge. Results show that the models estimated for the annual and monthly time scales perform quite well. However, model performance deteriorates for the weekly time scale, suggesting limitations in the assumed form of the conceptual model.

TI A hierarchical model for solute transport in fractured media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORK; FLOW; ROCK
AB A hierarchical concept for modeling solute transport in a well-connected fracture network is presented. The approach exploits the presence of dominating fractures to separate a fracture network into a small group of primary fractures that are represented explicitly and a much larger group of fractures that are included within network blocks. The primary fracture network is identified prior to a flow solution using deterministic rules that link fracture characteristics with the likelihood that a fracture may dominate its local flow regime. Equivalent conductance matrices unique to each network block closely approximate the hydraulic connections within the network blocks. This hierarchical structure leads to the formulation of much smaller systems of equations for calculating the flow regime when compared to conventional discrete network simulation. A particle-tracking scheme is developed that takes advantage of the hierarchical structure in modeling solute transport. Fracture systems considered include Poisson models; war-zone models; and a fractal, Levy-Lee model. As the range in the length scales of the fracture sets becomes broader or the variation in the transmissivity of individual fractures increases, it becomes more likely that individual fractures will dominate their local flow regime, that transport through a fracture network becomes less like that through a granular porous medium, and that a hierarchical model will provide a better approximation of transport. Poisson models with a bimodal length scale, and war-zone and fractal models, which lead to multiscale networks, can be effectively represented by a hierarchical model. For these systems the loss in accuracy due to approximations underlying the separation of the network into primary fractures and network blocks is small relative to the uncertainty inherent in the prediction of transport through fractured media. The hierarchical approach provides a better simulation strategy than one based on elimination of the least-transmissive fractures from the model structure.

AB The complex chemistry describing the biogeochemical dynamics in the natural subsurface environments gives rise to heterogeneous reaction networks, the individual segments of which can feature a wide range of timescales. This paper presents a formulation of the mass balance equations for the batch chemistry and the transport of groundwater contaminants Participating in such arbitrarily complex networks of reactions. We formulate the batch problem as an initial-value differential algebraic equation (DAE) system and compute its "index" so that the ease of solvability of the system is determined. We show that when the equilibrium reactions obey the law of mass action, the index of this initial-value DAE system is always unity (thus solvable with well-developed techniques) and that the system can be decoupled into a set of linearly implicit ordinary differential equations and a set of explicit algebraic equations. The formulations for the transport of these reaction networks can take advantage of their solvability properties under batch conditions. To avoid the error associated with time splitting fast reactions from transport, we present a split-kinetics approach where the fast equilibrium reactions are combined with transport equations while only the slower kinetic reactions are time split. These results are used to formulate and solve a simplified reaction network for the biogeochemical transformation of Co(II) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the presence of iron-coated sediments.

AB This paper investigates energy losses in compound channel under non-uniform flow conditions. Using the first law of thermodynamics, the concepts of energy loss and head loss are first distinguished. They are found to be different within one sub-section (main channel or floodplain). Experimental measurements of the head within the main channel and the floodplain are then analyzed for geometries with constant or variable channel width. Results show that head loss differs from one sub-section to another: the classical 1D hypothesis of unique head loss gradient appears to be erroneous. Using a model that couple 1D momentum equations, called "Independent Sub-sections Method (ISM)", head losses are resolved. The relative weights of head losses related to bed friction, turbulent exchanges and mass transfers between sub-sections are estimated. It is shown that water level and the discharge distribution across the channel are influenced by turbulent exchanges for (a) developing flows in straight channels, but only when the flow tends to uniformity; (b) flows in skewed floodplains and symmetrical converging floodplains for small relative flow depth; (c) flows in symmetrical diverging floodplains for small and medium relative depth. Flow parameters are influenced by the momentum flux due to mass exchanges in all non-prismatic geometries for small and medium relative depth, while this flux is negligible for developing flows in straight geometry. The role of an explicit modeling of mass conservation between sub-sections is eventually investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Dynamical modelling of concentration-age-discharge in watersheds

DE watershed modelling; age of tracers; dynamical systems
ID ENVIRONMENTAL TRACERS; TIME; HYDROLOGY; TRANSPORT; SYSTEMS
AB There is now a wide literature on the use of tracer age and transit time distributions to diagnose transport in environmental systems. Theories have been proposed using idealized tracer age modelling for ocean ventilation, atmospheric circulation, soil, stream and groundwater flow. Most approaches assume a steady flow regime and stationarity in the concentration (tracer) distribution function for age, although recent work shows that this is not a necessary assumption. In this paper, dynamic model for flow, concentration, and age in volume-averaged and a spatially distributed watershed system are derived in terms of the moments of the underlying distribution function for tracer age, time, and position. Several theoretical and practical issues are presented: (1) The low-order moments of the age distribution function are sufficient to construct a dynamical system for the mean age and concentration under steady or transient flow conditions. (2) Solutions to the coupled system of equations for flow, concentration and age show that 'age' of solutes stored within the watershed or leaving the watershed is a dynamic process which depends on flow variations as well as the solute or tracer dynamics. (3) Intermittency of wetting and drying cycles leads to an apparent increase in the tracer age in proportional to the duration of the 'dry' phase. (4) The question of how mobile/immobile flow may affect the age of solutes is examined by including a low permeable, passive store that relaxes the well-mixed assumption. (5). A spatially distributed advective and dispersive transport solution for age evolution over a simple 1-D hillslope is developed to demonstrate the age theory for a distributed source of water and tracer, and the solution is shown to have very similar input-output behaviour when compared to the volume-average model for comparable parameters.

AB Comparatively little is known about the hydrology of desert flash-floods despite the extent of the world's drylands, There is even less known about their sedimentary behaviour and particularly about the movement of coarse material as bedload. The results of an intense field monitoring programme carried out on an ephemeral gravel-bed stream in the northern Negev Desert are presented. In this semi-arid setting, flow duration analysis indicates that the channel is hydrologically active for 2% of the time, or about seven days per year, and that overbank flow can be expected for only 0.03% of the time - about three hours per year. Multipeaked flood hydrographs are the norm, reflecting many factors including the arrival of separate slugs of discharge from contributing subcatchments, The passage of the initial flood bore is surprisingly slow, but the rising limb of the flood hydrograph is rapid with a median time of rise of 10 minutes, in keeping with expected flash-hood behaviour. Bedload flux is high, averaging 2.67 kg s(-1) m(-1) during the period that the channel carries flow. This gives very high bedload sediment yield despite the infrequent and short duration of flood flows and matches the high yield of suspended sediment. The relationship between bedload flux and boundary shear stress is simple, in contrast with perennial gravel-bed streams, and the exponent of the log-log relationship is 1.52. Of great value is that the behaviour of the Nahal Eshtemoa corroborates a pattern established by the authors previously in a smaller tributary stream. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Water vapour in the atmosphere and various meteorological phenomena are essential to the understanding of the mechanism of the water cycle. However, it is very difficult to observe water vapour in the atmosphere because the quantities are usually observed at a single point not over long intervals or in a specific plane or volume. Accordingly, the use of radio waves is considered to be necessary to observe water vapour. Radio waves can be transmitted over long intervals and across large areas, and generally speaking, the characteristics of radio waves change due to material in the atmosphere, especially water vapour. Usually absorption is used to observe the quantity of water vapour. But the relationship between absorption and the quantity of water vapour is not linear, so we try to utilize the phase difference between two radio waves as an alternative method. First, the relationship between the phase delay and the water vapour was induced by a physical equation and the resulting phase delay was found to be proportional to the quantity of water vapour. Furthermore, the phase difference between two separate points was observed by use of two radio waves in the field, specifically 84 GHz and 245 GHz. For reference and comparison, water vapour density in the atmosphere was simultaneously observed by meteorological observation. As a result, the density of the water vapour was found to be proportional to the phase difference between the two radio waves. The result also shows that this method is able to measure the diurnal changes in water vapour density in each season. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Phosphorus sorption studies were carried out on particle size fractions of soils collected from the walls of gullies through a granitic and a sedimentary soil, as well as on particle size classes derived from breakage and abrasion of the 500 to 1400 mu m components of these soils. Sorption of phosphorus by the particle size classes of the sedimentary soil was much greater than those of the granite soil, and this also applied to the particles derived from breakage and abrasion.
   For the original sedimentary soil, sorption of phosphorus by the particle size components was strongly associated with the iron content and less strongly associated with the aluminium content and this also applied to the particles derived from breakage and abrasion. For the granitic soil these relationships were much less precise.
   A period of vigorous mixing, after 165 hours of gentle mixing, caused release of a proportion of the sorbed phosphorus from all particle sizes of the original granitic soil and for most of the breakage/abrasion derived particles. The released phosphorus was re-sorbed during a subsequent 48 hour period of settling.
   Relationships were evident between labile P and sorbed P for the particle size classes of the soils and treatments tested.
   Because particle size, lithology of the transported sediments and flow dynamics affect the distribution of phosphorus between water and sediments, they can also be expected to effect bio-availability of phosphorus. Particle breakage and abrasion during sediment transport is another factor likely to influence the bioavailability of P. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Partitioning of precipitation between evapotranspiration and runoff at the basin scale is primarily controlled by climate and basin characteristics. Here we use the Budyko hypothesis to investigate the impacts of soil texture and groundwater ( e. g., baseflow) on annual and long-term mean annual water balances of basins in a semiarid region located in and around the Sand Hills region of Nebraska, USA. Native grasslands are dominant across the study area with soil textures dramatically different for the Nebraska Sand Hills ( primarily sand deposits) and the adjacent regions ( mainly less permeable silt loam). For each basin, long-term hydrologic and meteorological data are obtained, and a baseflow index is calculated using daily streamflow data to quantify the groundwater contribution to streamflow. We found sound field evidence that suggests the control of soil texture on mean annual water balance and the impact of groundwater storage on interannual variability of water balance at catchment scales, which is usually seen at plot scales and in theoretical models. Our results show that compared to the basins located in the adjacent regions, the Nebraska Sand Hills basins experience much higher long-term mean annual surface runoff ratios ((R) over bar/(P) over bar) and thus lower ratios of ((P) over bar - (R) over bar)/(P) over bar, where (P) over bar is the long-term mean annual precipitation. The high baseflow index and its positive correlation with the ratio of (R) over bar/(P) over bar in the Sand Hills basins illustrate the role of lower ( higher) evapotranspiration ( recharge) rates. On annual time scales, the baseflow-dominated basins exhibit a negative relationship between annual ( P - R) / P and annual aridity index (i.e., the ratio of annual potential evapotranspiration to annual precipitation), which deviates from the original Budyko hypothesis. Moreover, with decreasing baseflow index, this negative relationship gradually transits into a positive relationship that follows Budyko's curves. Our results suggest that soil textural differences may strongly modify the impact of climate on regional water balance. These findings may have important implications for managing water resources under a fluctuating climate.

AB Previously unpublished water quality data are used to explore the potassium chemistry of a small upland stream following the 1976 drought in England. The behaviour of potassium is a complex response to several factors: hydrological pathways operating during periods of storm runoff; sediment inputs; and the chemical properties of the transporting water. Analyses of 'hysteresis loops' for a series of storms show that the relationship between suspended sediment and potassium concentrations is not simple; spatial and temporal variations in surface and subsurface stormflow add complexity. In addition to the specific discussion of potassium, data are presented to show the recovery of stream discharge, and of sediment and solute concentrations during the immediate post-drought period.

AB In this paper a dynamic two-dimensional two-phase flow model for a single variable aperture fracture is developed. The model is based on a finite volume implementation of the cubic law and the conservation of mass for each liquid. The two-phase fracture flow system is represented by incompressible parallel plate flow within two-dimensional subregions of constant aperture. The fluid phase distribution is represented by an explicit definition of the phase presence at each location within the domain. To achieve this definition, a phase distribution is assigned to each fracture subregion. Knowledge of the phase distribution allows calculation of interface capillary pressure based on the fracture aperture. One-dimensional analytic solutions for two-phase flow are developed and used to verify the model's behavior in one dimension. The model is verified against the Sandia Waste-Isolation Flow and Transport III model for the case of two-dimensional single-phase flow. Two-dimensional two-phase flow verification is performed qualitatively because no suitable analytic or physical model is currently available. Two-dimensional flow phenomena are investigated for variable aperture fractures generated using geostatistical methods. Results from these simulations illustrate the flow processes of phase isolation, pinching off of nonwetting phase globules, nonwetting phase refusal at the edges of tight regions, and downslope migration of a fluid countercurrent to flow of a less dense fluid.

DT Article
DE dam-break simulation; finite elements; parallel processing
AB The evolution of laws on dam safety in France is briefly described. Most simulation studies for such problems are currently attempted using one-dimensional models, and we investigate here the possibility of moving to two-dimensional simulations. To date, these have been constrained by lack of available computational power. Parallel processing is an obvious solution, however, to date, an efficient parallel processing method that does not require major software recoding has proved elusive. Domain-decomposition is identified as being capable of overcoming these problems, as it allows pre-existing software to be adapted to run on clusters of supercomputer processors, workstations or PCs. The development of this new parallel method is outlined and its accuracy and efficiency tested in terms of the TELEMAC-2D model applied to the Malpasset dam break accident, which occurred in 1959 in the south of France. After a discussion of the data available, a sensitivity study is performed to evaluate some physical parameters in the equations, mainly the diffusion coefficient and the bottom friction. The friction appears to be the most important. A discrepancy of 3.4% on the wave celerity is obtained between the model and field observations for a number of locations where the arrival time of the flood wave is perfectly known. The efficiency of different scalar and parallel machines is assessed. The study concludes that 2-D simulations of flood waves are already possible on domains with a length of some 10 s of kilometres. Larger domains (100 to 400 km) are also within reach with supercomputers, or with parallel architectures. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Important catchment-scale water and energy balance parameters are derived for a small catchment in southeastern Australia by assimilation in a catchment-scale soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) model of subcatchment-scale soil water content observations and land surface temperature measurements. in order to incorporate the subcatchment-scale soil moisture variability and its time evolution in a data assimilation scheme, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) method is used in combination with a cost function minimization approach to derive effective parameters for the catchment as a whole, These parameters are the minimum surface resistance to evaporation and the soil hydrodynamic parameters. This method provides a balanced assessment of all the uncertainties regarding the description of the catchment hydrological behaviour. Moreover, these uncertainties are propagated forward in time in a single framework, which combines soil moisture correction with effective parameter estimation. Two issues are addressed in this paper: (a) the applicability of the method for scaling purposes (effective parameterization) and (b) the relationship between effective parameters obtained by this method and parameters obtained by a classical minimization routine that ignores soil moisture correction and observation uncertainty. Effective parameters are found to be consistent,,with the available local parameter measurements. Derived parameter sets with and without EKF have been found to be very similar and this has been explained in a number of ways.

TI Basin level statistical properties of topographic index for North
   America
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL; SCALE
AB For land-atmosphere interaction studies several Topmodel based land-surface schemes have been proposed. For the implementation of such models over the continental land global) scales, statistical properties of the topographic indices are derived using GTOPO30 (30-arc-second; 1 km resolution) DEM data for North America. River basins and drainage network extracted using this dataset are overlaid on computed topographic indices for the continent and statistics are extracted for each basin. A total of 5020 basins are used to cover the entire continent with an average basin size of 3640 km(2). Typically, the first three statistical moments of the distribution of the topographic indices for each basin are required for modeling. Departures of these statistical moments to those obtained using high resolution data have important implications for the prediction of soil-moisture states in the hydrologic models and consequently on the dynamics of the land-atmosphere interaction. It is found that a simple relationship between the statistics obtained at the 1 km and 90 m resolutions can be developed. The mean, standard deviation, skewness, L-scale and L-skewness all show approximate linear relationships between the two resolutions making it possible to use the moment estimates from the GTOPO30 data for hydrologic studies by applying a simple linear downscaling scheme. This significantly increases the utility value of the GTOP030 datasets for hydrologic modeling studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. ALI rights reserved.

AB An investigation into the movement of the water surface in a surge tank following rapid valve opening is described. At the instant the valve is opened an allowance is made for some flow from the supply pipeline in addition to that from the surge tank and therefore the theory is altered only in the initial conditions. A program was written for a small desk-top calculator linked to a graph plotter to give a visual presentation of the finite difference solutions. Comparison was made with experimental values of the maximum downsurge observed in a model surge tank.

AB Stochastic theories of subsurface flow and transport have changed the way we think about heterogeneity but have not had much impact on practical groundwater modeling. Most numerical models still provide no information on prediction uncertainty. This gap between theory and practice is due largely to the excessive computational demands of available numerical methods for solving stochastic problems. The two primary alternatives, Monte Carlo and classical perturbation methods, both require solving large numbers of equations on fine grid spacings that are smaller than the log conductivity correlation length, no matter how smooth the mean flow and variance dynamics of interest are. This results in computational times that are many orders-of-magnitude greater than those required for conventional deterministic simulations. In addition, classical perturbation methods need much more real memory than comparable deterministic simulations. In this paper, we present an innovative approach for stochastic groundwater modeling-one that finally allows taking advantage of the scale disparity between the mean distributions and small-scale process. The new approach, which is called the nonstationary spectral method, implicitly separates the problem into rapidly varying random (stationary) part and a slowly varying deterministic (nonstationary) part and only the latter needs to be solved numerically. A general analysis and a specific numerical example both demonstrate that the nonstationary spectral method is much more efficient than the available alternatives. The methodological innovation dramatically increases the size and range of the problems that can be solved using stochastic methods and represents a major step forward in our effort to make stochastic uncertainty analysis a routine part of groundwater modeling.

TI More efficient optimization of long-term water supply portfolios
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSFERS; SIMULATION; VARIANCE; DROUGHT; OPTIONS
AB The use of temporary transfers, such as options and leases, has grown as utilities attempt to meet increases in demand while reducing dependence on the expansion of costly infrastructure capacity (e. g., reservoirs). Earlier work has been done to construct optimal portfolios comprising firm capacity and transfers, using decision rules that determine the timing and volume of transfers. However, such work has only focused on the short-term (e. g., 1-year scenarios), which limits the utility of these planning efforts. Developing multiyear portfolios can lead to the exploration of a wider range of alternatives but also increases the computational burden. This work utilizes a coupled hydrologic-economic model to simulate the long-term performance of a city's water supply portfolio. This stochastic model is linked with an optimization search algorithm that is designed to handle the high-frequency, low-amplitude noise inherent in many simulations, particularly those involving expected values. This noise is detrimental to the accuracy and precision of the optimized solution and has traditionally been controlled by investing greater computational effort in the simulation. However, the increased computational effort can be substantial. This work describes the integration of a variance reduction technique (control variate method) within the simulation/optimization as a means of more efficiently identifying minimum cost portfolios. Random variation in model output (i.e., noise) is moderated using knowledge of random variations in stochastic input variables (e. g., reservoir inflows, demand), thereby reducing the computing time by 50% or more. Using these efficiency gains, water supply portfolios are evaluated over a 10-year period in order to assess their ability to reduce costs and adapt to demand growth, while still meeting reliability goals. As a part of the evaluation, several multiyear option contract structures are explored and compared.

AB In this paper we report on vertical variations in the values of the effective diffusion coefficient determined on 19 chalk samples collected throughout most of the Eocene section (285 m) in the northern Negev desert, Israel. The dependence of the measured values on sample depth. porosity, permeability and mineralogy was also evaluated, Finally, a correlation between the measured effective diffusion coefficient and porosity is suggested for these samples.
   The calculated values of the diffusion coefficient ranged from 1.22 to 2.55 X 10(-6) cm(2)/s. These values are significantly higher than those measured on consolidated rock samples, and similar to values reported for British Cretaceous chalk. Our results demonstrate that the effective diffusion coefficient values for the Eocene chalk in the northern Negev desert, Israel are exclusively dependent on the porosity of the chalk matrix by D-e = D(0)epsilon(2) (m = 2 in Archie's law) and not on its mineralogy or permeability. The fitted exponent, in, falls between the two extreme values of 1.5 and 2.5 that were mentioned by [Diffusion in Natural Porous Media (1998)] for porous media. However, a linear relationship between the effective diffusion coefficient and porosity fits better the data within the range of the measured of porosities, These correlations provide an easier and less costly method of estimating the diffusion coefficient in chalk samples from the Eocene Group in the nor-them Negev desert, Israel.

AB The morphology of suspended sediment particles reflects the origin of the suspended load and any modifying processes that may have occurred during transport and storage in the aquatic system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of four fractal dimensions to quantify visually observed changes in the morphology of fluvial suspended sediment particles during baseflow conditions. Samples were collected during summer low flow in a small stream on the Canadian Prairies. Particle morphology data were obtained with a transmitted light microscope, a CCD camera and an image analysis system. The morphology of the particle population was characterized using four fractal dimensions (D, D-K, D-1 and D-2). D was derived from the area-perimeter relationship and showed an increase from 1.26 +/- 0.02 on 30 June, to 1.34 +/- 0.02 on 4 July, to 1.42 +/- 0.01 on 7 July. Visually, the increase in D represented the formation of large particles with intricate shapes and increased perimeters. D-K was determined from the area-rank relationship and varied from 1.86 +/- 0.01 on 30 June, to 1.90 +/- 0.00 on 4 July, to 1.74 +/- 0.00 on 7 July. The decrease in D-K between 4 July and 7 July would indicate a greater concentration of the particle area over a small number of large particles. Although the decrease in D-K is consistent with observed changes in the particle size distributions, D-K should be used with the considerable caution because D-K varied more than one standard error between replicates. D-1 and D-2 were determined from the length-perimeter and length-area relationships, respectively. D-1 proved to be of little value for quantifying changes in particle morphology as it showed little change with time, despite considerable visual changes. D-2 however, was useful, despite some variation between replicates. Over the sampling period, D-2 for the composite data sets showed a steady decrease from 1.74 +/- 0.02 on 30 June, to 1.68 +/- 0.02 on 4 July, to 1.60 +/- 0.01 on 7 July. This change in D-2 indicates that, through time, the larger particles became longer and thinner relative to the smaller ones. This study shows that temporal changes in D, D-K and D-2 were consistent with, and allow quantification of, observed changes in particle morphology. D-1 did not reflect observed morphological changes, and is therefore of little value for this type of study. The changes in particle morphology coincided with an increase in primary production in the form of algae. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Non-perennial rivers and streams are ubiquitous on our planet. Although several metrics have been used to statistically group or compare streamflow characteristics, there is currently no widely used definition of how many days or over what reach length surface flow must cease in order to classify a river as non-perennial. At the same time, the breadth of climate and geographic settings for non-perennial rivers leads to diversity in their flow regimes, such as how often or how quickly they go dry. These rivers have a rich and expanding body of literature addressing their ecologic and geomorphic features, but are often said to be ignored by hydrologists. Yet there is much we do know about their hydrology in terms of streamflow generation processes, water losses, and variability in flow. We also know that while they are prevalent in arid regions, they occur across all climate types and experience a diverse set of natural and anthropogenic controls on streamflow. Furthermore, measuring and modeling the hydrology of these rivers presents a distinct set of challenges, and there are many research directions, which still require further attention. Therefore, we present an overview of the current understanding, methodologic challenges, knowledge gaps, and research directions for hydrologic understanding of non-perennial rivers; critical topics in light of both growing global water scarcity and ever-changing laws and policies that dictate whether and how much environmental protection these rivers receive.

AB Through a series of simulation experiments in the laboratory on the broad-leaved tree Acer mono Maxim, we obtain interception datasets of individual events under different rainfall intensities and leaf area indexes (LAls). Based on the data, the relationship between rainfall intensity and maximum interception of per unit LAI is quantified. The variation of interception with canopy wetness index is also identified. Hence, an interception model, in which interception is calculated using rainfall intensity and LAI, is constructed with consideration of canopy wetness. Finally, according to the validation experiments, it is concluded that the precision of the model is 92.7%. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & S ons, Ltd.

AB Unsaturated flow systems were studied which consisted of two-dimensional doublets embedded in a porous medium. The isolated flow regions formed around the doublets (source-sink combinations) were called Rankine bodies as a generalization of the classical geometries used in fluid mechanics for solutions to Laplace's equation. The motivation was to simulate unsaturated flow around subterranean objects, such as cavities and rock inclusions. The results were generally successful and patterns for single inclusions qualitatively matched more elaborate solutions based on scattering theory. A complex system (of five inclusions) was presented to simulate a layered case of rock inclusions within a profile.

TI SIMULATION OF DIRECT RUNOFF VOLUMES AND PEAK RATES FOR RURAL CATCHMENTS
   IN KENYA, EAST-AFRICA
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Estimation of direct runoff volume and peak runoff rates for small rural catchments in Kenya, East Africa, poses a problem in view of the limited gauged data available. The problem can be circumvented by adopting a modelling approach. This, however, does require some base data for model calibration and validation. A highly reliable data base for two small catchments, Sambret (7.02 km(2)) and Lagan (5.44 km(2)), for nearly 22 years (1958-1980) is used in the present study. These catchments lie in the headwaters of the Lake Victoria drainage basin in Kenya and were intensively instrumented by the former East African Agricultural and Forestry Research Organisation (EAAFRO). In the Sambret catchment, 41 rainfall-runoff events were available, out of which 25 were used for model calibration while the other 16 were used for validation. To further verify the applicability of the models to different catchments, 18 events from the neighbouring Lagan catchment were also used. The SCS curve number procedure proposed by the United States Soil Conservation Service was used to estimate the direct runoff volumes. The curve numbers were derived from storm rainfall-runoff relationships and the results obtained were satisfactory. Peak runoff rates were derived by both Nash and kinematic wave models for the estimated runoff volumes. The Nash model gave acceptable results in both Sambret and Lagan. The kinematic wave model performed well in Sambret only; in Lagan, it under-predicted the peak runoff rates.

TI Role of dimensionless numbers in wave analysis

ID PLANE; FLOW
AB Dimensionless numbers, including the Reynolds number Re, the wave number sigma, the Froude number F, the quasi-shallow wave number sigma(v), the kinematic wave number K, Vedernikov number V, and others, are frequently encountered in analytical and numerical analyses of waves occurring in frictional and frictionless channels. Depending on their derivation, these numbers can be classified into physical, geometrical, derived, input-based numbers, and their combinations. It can be shown that (a) the waves under friction are primarily governed by R-e, pointing to friction laws and, consequently, the rating exponent; (b) the wave number characterizes the wave type for a given R-e; (c) the numbers describing the reference state of flow do not have the efficacy of characterizing a wave type on its own, e.g. F-o that describes the significance of inertial forces in wave motion; (d) coupling of F-o with sigma produces a more efficacious number K; (e) Vedernikov number V, a combination of the rating exponent or, in turn, Re and Fo, is more powerful than either R-e or F-o; and (f) the numbers emanating from analytical solutions describe the wave types, whereas those emanating from numerical analyses usually prescribe the limits for stable solutions, such as Courant number C-r and cell Reynolds number D. The significance of these numbers is described using the case of evolution and propagation of a dam-break flood wave. Furthermore, it is shown that as sigma forms the basic unit of shallow wave description, then quasi-shallow waves are described by the quasi-shallow wave number sigma(v) the wave length parameter normalized by the normal depth of flow.

TI 2-COMPONENT LOG-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF IRRIGATION-AFFECTED LOW FLOWS
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A new approach is used for the determination of the theoretical distribution of low flows in a highly developed basin. As estimates of water diversions and return flows from irrigation may have high errors, difficulties arise in transforming an observed series of river flows to a natural series, which is a prior requirement in a statistical analysis of this type.  A priori reasoning suggests that the net diversions may be represented by linear, non-linear or truncated functions of river flows. A two-component log-normal distribution is proposed, in which the first component represents the natural low flows in the basin, unaffected by irrigation, and the second component models the effects of diversions, return flows and other regulations. The adopted diversion rule provides the link between the components. The maximum likelihood method is applied for parameter estimation, but simplified procedures based on the method of moments are investigated, and one which results in a sufficiently good fit is obtained. The feasibility of relating the constants of the net diversion rules to physical parameters such as catchment area is investigated. The method is applied to the Po basin, the largest in Italy.

AB Various methods for mapping heavy rainfall (10-year and 100-year rainfall) at time steps of between 1 and 24 h are compared. These methods are applied to the French Alps, a mountainous region subject to heavy rainfall. Data are obtained not only from recording raingauges (measuring precipitation over short time steps of 1, 2, 3, 6 12 and 24 h), but also from abundant daily raingauges. Among the methods reviewed, kriging is based only on the interpolation of recording raingauge data. Other methods tested make use of additional information obtained from daily measurements. Daily raingauges are more numerous than recording raingauges in the study region and the more accurate knowledge of the daily rainfall field provides valuable information for time steps of less than 24 h. Another method tested includes relationships between rainfall and topography, of importance in a mountainous region such as the French Alps. All these methods are compared using cross-validation. Comparison shows that topography is indeed an important parameter for short time steps. Using daily information improves mapping for time steps between 6 and 12 h. For the daily time step, the field is always well reconstituted, whatever the method used, since the measurement network is sufficiently dense to ensure accurate interpolation between the measurement points (except for zones at elevations above 2000 m, where there are no measurement stations).

AB [1] It has been suggested that pipe flow and bedrock groundwater play important roles in storm runoff generation. We examined the effects of pipe flow on storm runoff generation and the roles of bedrock groundwater in rainfall-runoff phenomena in a steep headwater catchment in central Japan. Measurements of pore water pressures, pipe flow, and streamflow showed that when the total rainfall amount was <30 mm, the runoff process could be explained by Darcy's law using the saturated hydraulic conductivity values core samples. When the total rainfall was >70 mm, the dominant runoff process shifted to pipe flow. Temperature measurements indicated four key points: (1) During base flow conditions (streamflow <0.1 mm h(-1)), bedrock groundwater dominated streamflow; (2) during storm flow conditions (streamflow >0.2 mm h(-1)) the source of pipe flow was the same as the streamflow; (3) the transient groundwater at the upper hillslope was commonly dominated by the preevent soil water; and (4) only after the large storms with wet antecedent conditions, was water emerging from the bedrock and mixing with preevent soil water in the transient saturated area at the upper hillslope. Both the hydrometric and temperature measurements indicated that once pipe flow occurs, the contributing area of streamflow extended to upper hillslope, and the transient groundwater at the upper hillslope was delivered to the stream via preferential flow paths, shortcutting the normal mixing process through the soil matrix.

AB We present a method for deriving the ensemble-averaged reactive solute transport equation for unsteady, non-divergence-free flow field conditions. Our approach uses a cumulant expansion, Lie group theory, and time-ordered exponentials to develop the ensemble-averaged transport equation. The cumulant expansion is in powers of a alpha tau(c), where alpha measures the magnitude of the perturbations of the transport and reaction operators and tau(c) is the correlation time of these perturbations. Because the cumulant expansion avoids secular terms (terms in powers of time), the problem can be closed by rationally truncating the expansion. The truncated terms can be shown to be of lower order than those terms that are kept, provided that a particular constraint (in terms of the Kubo number) is met. The use of Lie group theory allows one to automatically combine the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. A particular time-ordered exponential that arises in the analysis can be interpreted as a translation operator that possesses a well-defined algebra. These translation operators appear in the second-order (covariance) terms of the cumulant expansion, and their effect is to shift one of the terms of the covariance functions relative to the other along the trajectory formed by the ensemble-averaged velocity field. This approach does not require neglecting the local dispersion tensor and has the advantage that no integral transformations are conducted; therefore all results are expressed in terms of real space variables.

ID ENERGY-BALANCE; NEW-JERSEY
AB Long-term trends in annual evaporation and watershed Bowen ratio were studied on 51 eastern United States watersheds which had experienced an estimated 0-58% urban/residential development between 1920 and 1990. Annual watershed evaporation was estimated as the difference between annual streamflow and average watershed precipitation, corrected for watershed elevation effects and gage catch error. Annual watershed Bowen ratios were estimated using spatially and temporally averaged net radiation values and annual evaporation. Significant (alpha = 0.1) positive trends in annual watershed Bowen ratio and negative trends in evaporation were found for 12 and 10 watersheds, respectively, of 28 watersheds with >2% urban/residential development and only 2 and 3 watersheds, respectively, of 23 watersheds with <2% development. Trend results lead to estimates of the overall change in water and energy balances which were separately related to the percentage change in urban/residential area for all 51 watersheds. These regional relationships, linking watershed hydrology, energy exchange, and land use changes, showed significant decreases in watershed evaporation and significant increases in sensible heating of the atmosphere with increased urban/residential development on watersheds in the eastern United States. At 100% urbanization the regional relationships predicted a decrease in annual evaporation of 22 cm and an increase in the sensible heating of the atmosphere of 13 W/m(2).

AB A brief overview of the existing chemical and biological models of biodegradation in porous media is given. A revised biological model of aerobic degradation of organic matter in benthic sediments is developed. The model is based on steady state balance equations for microbial mass, organic matter, and oxygen. The biomass balance equation involves a logistic trophic function (instead of the classical Malthusian one) describing the self-regulation of microbial abundance. One of the corollaries of the model is the dependence of the decay rate upon the organic matter content S in the form dS/dt proportional to S-2/(S + K-S)(2) (where K-S is a constant) that implies two extreme cases: dS/dt is independent of S at small K-S (refractory organics) and dS/dt proportional to S-2 at large K-S (labile organics), instead of the commonly used law dS/dt proportional to S. The oxygen consumption rate J is expressed through the oxygen concentration O-0 in the overlying water and three generalized parameters. This function demonstrates the effect of the plateau at large O-0. The dependence J(O-0) is calibrated for the three experimental systems of the literature, two of which have high oxygen consumption rates and one low. For the latter, the model parameters are estimated and their correspondence to the evidence available is discussed. Depth profiles of oxygen, organic matter, and biomass are computed and the aerobic zone thickness is determined.

AB A new methodology for solution of the inverse problem in groundwater hydrology is proposed and applied to a site in southeastern New Mexico with extensive hydrogeologic data. The methodology addresses the issue of nonuniqueness of the inverse solutions by generating an ensemble of transmissivity fields considered to be equally likely, each of which is in agreement with the measured transmissivity and pressure data. It consists of generating a selected number of conditionally simulated transmissivity fields and then calibrating each of the fields to match the measured steady state or transient pressures, in a least squares sense. The calibration phase involves an iterative implementation of an automated pilot point approach coupled with conditional simulations. Pilot points are the parameters of calibration. They are synthetic transmissivity data which are added to the transmissivity database to produce a revised conditional simulation during calibration. Coupled kriging and adjoint Sensitivity analysis is employed for the optimal location of pilot points, and gradient search methods are used to derive their optimal transmissivities. The pilot point methodology is well suited for characterizing the spatial variability of the transmissivity field in contrast to methods using zonation. Pilot points are located where their potential for minimizing the objective function is the highest. This minimizes the perturbations in the transmissivities which are optimally assigned to the pilot point and results in minimal changes to the covariance structure of the transmissivity field. The calibrated fields honor the transmissivity measurements at their locations, preserve the variogram, and match the measured pressures in a least squares sense. Since there are numerous options in the execution of this methodology, computational experiments have been conducted to identify the most efficient among them. The method has been applied to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) site, in southeastern New Mexico, where the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting probabilistic system assessment for the permanent disposal of transuranic nuclear waste. The resulting calibrated transmissivity fields are input to a Monte Carlo analysis of the total system performance. The present paper, paper 1 of a two-paper presentation, describes the methodology. Paper 2, a companion paper, presents the methodology's application to the WIPP site.

ID ANSWERS
AB A new hydrological and soil erosion model has been developed and tested: LISEM, the Limburg soil erosion model. The model uses physically based equations to describe interception, infiltration and soil water transport, storage in surface depressions, splash and flow detachment, transport capacity and overland and channel flow. From the validation results it is clear that, although the model has several advantages over other models, the results of LISEM 1.0 are far from perfect. Based on the sensitivity analysis and held observations, the main reasons for these differences seems to be the spatial and temporal variability of the soil hydraulic conductivity and the initial pressure head at the basin scale. Another reason for the differences between measured and simulated results is our lack or understanding of the theory of hydrological and soil erosion processes.

TI Model smoothing strategies to remove microscale discontinuities and

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS; TOPMODEL
AB Environmental processes frequently exhibit threshold-type behavior, e. g., the initiation of fluxes such as snowmelt, recharge, and quick flow. Incorporating such thresholds into hydrological models introduces discontinuities into the objective functions used in model calibration, making parameter estimation unnecessarily more difficult. Moreover, this study shows that model thresholds can produce spurious multimodality in least squares objective functions even if the underlying model is near linear in its parameters. In contrast, smoothing the model with respect to its parameters and inputs yields differentiable objective functions and, in some cases, can also improve its macroscale characteristics by removing spurious secondary optima. This simplifies model calibration and sensitivity analysis by reducing the complexity of objective functions and permitting the use of powerful derivative-based analysis methods such as Newton-type optimization and Hessian-based uncertainty assessment. This paper details smoothing strategies for several classes of thresholds and discontinuities commonly found in hydrological models, including step and angle discontinuities in the constitutive functions and flux constraints arising from conservation laws in the governing differential equations. The smoothing algorithms and their parameters are selected to ensure infinite differentiability of the model and its objective functions while preserving the macroscale behavior of the original governing equations. The improvements in the structure of the model and its objective functions are illustrated empirically for a degree-day-based snow model. The smoothing techniques are general and can be applied to other models with thresholds.

AB Field surveys of channel width w and drainage area A in bedrock channel reaches reveal relationships where w = CA(b), Similar to the classic hydraulic geometry of alluvial channels. Data from five mountain channel networks support the assumption used in many landscape evolution models that an alluvial hydraulic geometry relationship where b = 0.3-0.5 holds for bedrock channel systems. Although there is substantial local variability in channel width in bedrock channel systems, there is no systematic difference in width versus drainage area relations for the surveyed bedrock and alluvial reaches in sedimentary lithologies in coastal Oregon and Washington. In contrast, bedrock channels were narrower, and therefore had deeper flow, than alluvial channels with equal drainage areas in the granite and limestone terrain of the Yuba River, California. in addition, data from the Mokelumne River show that bedrock channel width decreases substantially downstream at the contact between relatively weak limestone and more erosion-resistant granite, but that channel slope does not change appreciably across contacts between these two lithologies. Data from coastal Oregon drainage basins further show systematic channel widening after flood flows and debris flow impacts. We conclude that downstream Variations in the width of bedrock channels generally follow traditional hydraulic geometry relations but also reflect the local influence of longitudinal patterns of bedrock erosivity and disturbance history.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
AB A few aspects of spatial variability, connected with climate variability, in the Rio de la Plata basin are analysed through changes in the basin runoff considered as indicative of the annual integrated precipitation. Those changes contain better information on climate variability than the sparse records of precipitation and temperature in view of the high spatial and temporal variability of those parameters. The precipitation data are applied in the most active zones of the basin, however, in order to assess aspects of hydrological variability that the lack of data causes in the studied region. The hydrological series employed correspond to average monthly and yearly flows at stations selected along the main rivers, both due to stability in their gauging stations and to the availability and quality of data for the 1931-1992 period. This period includes the longest series of simultaneous observations for the stations selected. Similar approaches were applied to the series of precipitation. Through basic statistical analysis, and from the annual evolution of flows and precipitation, the study of the relationship between rainfalls in the area and flows at separate hydrological stations (taking also the annual cycle of precipitation and flows into account), nine hydrological areas were detected. From those areas, well separated from each other, the spatial variability for the Rio de la Plata basin was characterized.

AB Characterization of heterogeneity at the field scale generally requires detailed aquifer properties such as transmissivity and hydraulic head. An accurate delineation of these properties is expensive and time consuming, and for many if not most groundwater systems, is not practical. As an alternative approach, stochastic representation of random fields is used and presented in this paper. Specifically, an iterative stochastic conditional simulation approach was applied to a hypothetical and highly heterogeneous pre-designed aquifer system. The approach is similar to the classical co-kriging technique; it uses a linear estimator that depends on the covariance functions of transmissivity (T), and hydraulic head (h), as well as their cross-covariances. A linearized flow equation along with a conditional random field generator constitutes the iterative process of the conditional simulation. One hundred equally likely realizations of transmissivity fields with pre-specified geostatistical parameters were generated, and conditioned to both limited transmissivity and head data. The successful implementation of the approach resulted in conditioned flow paths and travel-time distribution under different degrees of aquifer heterogeneity. This approach worked well for fields exhibiting small variances. However, for random fields exhibiting large variances (greater than 1.0), an iterative procedure was used. The results show that, as the variance of the ln[T] increases, the flow paths tend to diverge, resulting in a wide spectrum of flow conditions, with no direct discernable relationship between the degree of heterogeneity and travel time. The applied approach indicates that high errors may result when estimation of particle travel times in a heterogeneous medium is approximated by an equivalent homogeneous medium.

AB In recent years soil vapor extraction (SVE) has been used extensively to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the vadose zone. In order to investigate processes limiting the removal of VOCs during the later stages of SVE operations, multicomponent soil-venting experiments were performed at different water contents in a sand tank (80 x 66 x 5 cm) in the absence of a liquid organic phase. Four chlorinated VOCs were used as the model compounds. A homogeneous packing of quartz sand was used as the model soil. Gas phase concentrations were measured at several locations with different water saturations during each experiment. The compounds did not adsorb onto the sand. Volatilization was the key process for VOC removal. Gas concentrations decreased more slowly at locations with high water saturation and for compounds having a small Henry's law constant. Gas concentrations observed for experiments conducted at low water content were found to be a function of dimensionless time. Tailing in gas concentration distributions at large dimensionless times was attributed solely to diffusion in interparticle water and suggested that local nonequilibrium conditions prevailed; This hypothesis was supported by numerical simulations based on the local equilibrium assumption (LEA) and a first-order kinetics approach. For the experiments conducted at low water saturations the LEA was valid only for small dimensionless times. Tailing in the gas concentration distributions could then be described quite well by means of a first-order kinetic approach using calibrated mass transfer coefficients.

   modelling of hydrological droughts in Zimbabwean rivers
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
ID STREAMFLOW
AB An investigation of hydrological droughts has been conducted, based on the truncation level approach: each drought event is characterized by its duration and deficit volume. The truncation level is defined to reflect the expected natural water availability and, therefore, is evaluated monthly as a fixed percentile of the monthly flow-duration curve. Thus, the problem of expected zero flow of ephemeral rivers during the dry season is taken care of. The data material consists of daily discharge data from ten Zimbabwean rivers, and both ephemeral and perennial rivers are included in the analysis. The partial duration series approach is used to predict the severity of future droughts, i.e. the T-year events. The two-component exponential distribution is adopted as exceedence distribution for both duration and deficit volume. The parameters of the two-component exponential distribution are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. A method for calculating the T-year event and an approximate expression of the uncertainty of the T-year events have been developed. An observed problem of underestimation of observed deficit volumes is reduced by the introduction of censoring in the partial duration series. A better description of the observed events has been obtained by censoring the duration and deficit volume series. A relationship between optimal censoring and the coefficient of variation of the drought series has been indicated.

AB In this paper, a screening model for flow of a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) and associated chemical transport in the vadose zone is developed. The model is based on kinematic approximation of the governing equations for both the NAPL and a partitionable chemical constituent. The resulting governing equation is a first-order, quasi-linear hyperbolic equation to which the generalized method of characteristics can be applied. This approach generally neglects the contribution to the NAPL flux from capillary pressure gradients. During infiltration under ponded conditions, or when the NAPL flux exceeds the maximum effective conductivity of the soil, the effect of capillary suction is included in the model through the usage of the Green-Ampt model. All of the resulting model equations are in the form of ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically by a variable time step Runge-Kutta technique. Results from a simple column experiment were used to evaluate the vadose zone flow model assumptions. Independently measured parameters allow simulation without calibration of the model results. The match of the model to the data suggests that the model captures the qualitative behavior of the experimental system and is capable of an acceptable degree of quantitative agreement.

AB [1] In a constant-head test (CHT), groundwater is withdrawn from a well that has a fixed drawdown. Accordingly, the CHT is particularly useful in aquifers of low transmissivity because the constant-head well would not be dewatered owing to overpumping. The problem of interest pertains to a CHT in a homogeneous and anisotropic unconfined aquifer, where water released by the water table decline is assumed to be instantaneous and the skin effect surrounding the constant-head well is represented by a skin factor. A two-dimensional transient well hydraulics model is developed, and its Laplace domain solutions of aquifer drawdown and the constant-head well discharge are determined. It is found that the three distinct segments typically noted in the time drawdown history of a constant-rate test (CRT) are also characteristic of the temporal drawdown variation of the CHT. However, the early time and late time asymptotes conform to the radial flow solution of a CHT in confined aquifers as given by Hantush [1964]. Under the late time radial flow conditions the asymptotic solution is in terms of an apparent storage coefficient equal to the sum of the storage coefficient and the specific yield, and a specific mass balance relation exists among the constant-head well discharge, the discharge due to aquifer storage, and the discharge resulted from the water table decline. While aquifer drawdown and the constant-head well discharge are under the influence of well skin, their ratios are free from it. A curve matching method using this ratio is developed to determine the horizontal and the vertical hydraulic conductivities, the storage coefficient, and the specific yield. When the prescribed constant drawdown is not negligibly small in comparison to the initial saturated thickness, aquifer drawdown in late times may be large, and thus a drawdown correction is needed for data analysis. It is found that the Jacob correction for large drawdown of a CRT can also be used for the late drawdown correction in a CHT.

AB Major solute concentrations in overland flow water (OFW) were measured in an agricultural field of Brittany (western France). Two storm events were monitored in detail to examine the short time-scale processes. During one year, samples were taken at different positions on the slope after each storm event to describe the spatial and seasonal variations of OFW chemistry. Although the total dissolved load in OFW is not much higher than in rain water, distinctive features are observed. K+, Ca2+, NH4, Cl- and SO42- are the major solutes. The main origin of the elements (sea salts, exchangeable soil complex or fertilizers) determined most of the variations observed. Spatial variations along the slope are mainly seen for exchangeable cations, while seasonal variations are predominant for sea salts. Rainfall intensity and suspended sediment load induce strong differences between the two storm events studied in detail. However, the within-storm variations and the seasonal monitoring show that this relationship is complex. Within-storm variations suggest that, in addition to desorption processes, mixing with pre-event water may occur. The lack of a relationship between sediment load and dissolved load is attributed to the high rate of the exchange processes, which has been checked by a simple experiment in vitro. It is concluded that the conditions of the transit of water on the field (velocity, length, status of the surface, crusted or not) may well play a major role in the chemical changes between rain water and OFW. The results suggest that vegetated buffer strips designed to reduce the sediment load only, and not the amount of overland flow, will have little effect on the transfer of dissolved pollutants to the watercourses.

AB The main focus of the present study is to assess the impact of finite flow domain size on solute travel time statistics for a nonreactive conservative solute in a bounded three-dimensional statistically isotropic porous medium. This is accomplished by introducing a modified covariance function of log hydraulic conductivity, accounting for a finite sample size, into the evaluation of solute travel time statistics within the framework of stochastic theory and the spectral perturbation techniques. This study finds that the first two moments of solute travel time for advection-dominated solute movement increase with the size of flow domain. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   PATTERN
AB The aim of this paper is to investigate, in general terms, the effects of storm movement on the resulting flood peaks, and the underlying process controls. For this purpose, we utilize a broad theoretical framework that uses characteristic time and space scales associated with stationary rainstorms as well as moving rainstorms. For a stationary rainstorm the characteristic timescales that govern the peak response include two intrinsic timescales of a catchment and one extrinsic timescale of a rainstorm. On the other hand, for a moving rainstorm, two additional extrinsic scales are required, the storm travel time and storm size. The relationship between the peak response and the timescales appropriate for a stationary rainstorm can be extended in a straightforward manner to describe the peak response for a moving rainstorm. However, the interdependence between rainfall duration and storm travel time makes the behavior of the peak response for a moving rainstorm fundamentally different from that of a stationary rainstorm. We show that the relationship between peak response and characteristic timescales also depends on the relative size of the rainstorm with respect to catchment size. For moving rainstorms, we show that the augmentation of peak response arises from both the effect of overlaying the responses from subcatchments (resonance condition) and the effect of increased responses from subcatchments due to increased duration (interdependence), which results in maximum peak response when the moving rainstorm is slower than the channel flow velocity.

TI A multiscale approach for estimating solute travel time distributions
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
ID REGULARIZATION; TRANSPORT; FUSION
AB This paper uses a multiscale statistical framework to estimate groundwater travel times and to derive conditional travel time probability densities. In the applications of interest here travel time uncertainties depend primarily on uncertainties in hydraulic conductivity. These uncertainties can be reduced if the travel times are conditioned on scattered measurements of hydraulic conductivity and/or hydraulic head. In our approach the spatially discretized log hydraulic conductivity is modeled as a multiscale stochastic process, where each scale describes the process at a different spatial resolution. Related dependent variables such as hydraulic head and travel time are approximated by discrete linear functions of the log conductivity. The linearization makes it possible to incorporate these variables into efficient multiscale estimation and conditional simulation algorithms. We illustrate the application of these algorithms by considering two options for estimating travel time densities: (1) a Monte Carlo technique which only requires linearization of the groundwater flow equation and (2) a Gaussian approximation which also requires linearization of Darcy's law and an implicit particle tracking equation. Both options provide reasonable estimates of the travel time probability density in a synthetic experiment if the underlying log hydraulic conductivity variance is small (0.5). When this variance is increased (to 5.0), the Monte Carlo result is still quite good but the Gaussian approximation is unsatisfactory. The multiscale Monte Carlo option is a very competitive approach for estimating travel time since it provides accurate results over a wide range of conditions and it is more computationally efficient than competing alternatives.

AB A multidisciplinary approach is followed for analysis of the effect of changes in land use patterns on the hydrologic response of the Vergara watershed (4340 km(2)) located in central Chile. Probable future land use scenarios were generated using heuristic rules and logistic regression models, in order to identify and represent the main pressure on the watershed, namely forestation of extensive areas used for agriculture with rapid growing exotic species. The hydrologic response of the watershed was computed with a physically based distributed precipitation-runoff model, which was calibrated and validated for the current period. Results show that mean annual discharge increase with agricultural land use and diminish with introduced forest coverage. Thus, forestation of areas with introduced species like Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus might be regulated in order to protect the water resources of the watershed.

AB The landmass of Aotearoa New Zealand totals some 268,000 km(2), including 425,000 km of rivers, more than 4,000 lakes and approximately 200 aquifers. For Aotearoa New Zealand's indigenous Maori, these freshwater bodies are part of a complex system of genealogical relationships from which derive the traditional Maori knowledge, values and ethics which shape Maori customary practices for freshwater monitoring and freshwater management. The rupture of these relationships through a century and a half of colonization and industrialization and the dispossession of Maori from their lands and waters also dispossessed Maori of their rights and responsibilities to enact traditional customary practices ofkaitiakitanga, stewardship of the natural environment. In 2017 Aotearoa New Zealand's freshwater systems were designated as among the worst in the world. Today they are continuing to degrade. This article focuses on Maori traditional knowledge, ethics and values for freshwater monitoring and management. The article reviews the impact of colonization and development on Aotearoa New Zealand's freshwater systems, the extensive struggle by Maori for recognition of Maori traditional knowledge, rights and responsibilities regarding waterways, and the development of contemporary Maori models for freshwater monitoring and management. Treaty settlements and other legislative initiatives have also catalyzed changes in freshwater management. Faced with catastrophic climatic impacts on freshwater systems and implications for the wellbeing of species and communities, questions of how to ethically manage freshwater are critical. Maori freshwater ethics, values and practices provide a model of renewal and possibility, although one that is not without contest.

AB We simulate column experiments of europium migration in humic-rich groundwater performed with different Darcy velocities to investigate the predictive capability of colloid-facilitated transport models for actinides. The simulation results indicate two retention mechanisms:. sorption of dissolved contaminants and filtration of colloidal contaminants by the matrix. These interaction processes, which determine the breakthrough curves and their tailing behavior, are kinetically controlled. Sorption constants are derived from batch experiments. Sorption rates are obtained by the simulation and are compared with the values of the filtration rate predicted by the colloid filtration theory.

AB The vadose zone plays an essential role in all types of processes that occur in the soil. Modelling of the processes in the vadose zone helps to understand and quantify effects of, for example, land use, irrigation, salinity and climate changes. Version 2 of SWAP (soil-water-atmosphere-plant) is a numerical model that simulates the (interaction between) one-dimensional soil moisture, heat and solute transport in the topsoil layers. The influence of all these processes on crop growth may be simulated as well. This article describes briefly some of the options the program offers. The results of a sensitivity analysis are discussed, followed by a case study on variations in soil salinity in a coastal area. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID TIME-SERIES; HYDROLOGY; TRANSPORT; CATCHMENT; BALANCE; MODEL; BASIN
AB In glacierized catchments, meteorological inputs driving surface melting are translated into runoff outputs mediated by the glacier hydrological system: analysis of the relationship between meteorology and diurnal and seasonal patterns of runoff should reflect the functioning of that system, with the role of meltwater storage likely to be of particular importance. Daily meltwater storage is determined for a glacier at 78 degreesN in the Svalbard archipelago, by comparing inputs calculated from a surface energy balance model with measured outputs (proglacial discharge). Solar radiation, air temperature, wind speed and proglacial discharge are then analysed by regression and time-series methods, in order to assess the meteorology-discharge relationship and its variation at diurnal and seasonal time-scales. The recorded discharge time-series can be divided into two contrasting intervals: up to early August, proglacial discharge was high and variable, mean hydrographs showed little indication of diurnal cycling, ARIMA models of discharge indicated a non-seasonal, moving-average generating process, and there was a net loss of meltwater from storage; from early August, proglacial discharge was low and relatively invariable, but with clearer diurnal cycles, regression models of discharge showed substantially improved correlations with air temperature and solar radiation, ARIMA models indicated a non-seasonal, autoregressive generating process, and eventually a seasonal component, and there was a net gain in meltwater storage. The transition between the two periods is brief compared with the duration of the melt season. The runoff response to meteorology therefore lacks the strongly progressive element previously identified in mid-latitude glacierized catchments. In particular, the glacier hydrological system only appears responsive to diurnal forcing following the depletion of the seasonal snowpack meltwater store. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Information on the distribution of acid-soluble Al, Ba, Co, Cr, Ni, Fe, Mn and Pb associated with suspended sediment is presented for the major Humber rivers draining into the North Sea. The data analysed are based on two major data sets: the Land-Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) and Environment Agency (EA) regional monitoring programmes. Trace metal particulate concentrations show a large variation over space and time. Three types of pattern are observed. First, Ba and Pb are highly and linearly correlated and they have an order of magnitude higher concentrations to the north of the region owing to localized bedrock mineralization, historic mining activity and the associated contamination of floodplain areas during the 18th and 19th centuries (type 1). Secondly, there are strong interelement relationships between Al, Co, Ni and Fe (and to a lesser extent Mn) and between these elements and suspended sediment concentrations (type 2) and the points for all the rivers lie on the same straight line. For type 2 elements, concentrations are enriched by a factor of three within the industrially affected rivers in the central and southern parts of the area: the rural Swale in the north of the area also has enhanced concentrations of type 2 elements in relation to higher suspended sediment concentrations. Thirdly, chromium shows about a thirty-fold enrichment in the industrial rivers (type 3). The relationships between all the trace metals are represented by a simple three-component mixing scheme involving natural background materials, industrially generated particulates and resuspended floodplain sediments contaminated by historic mining activity.
   The need for (a) focused studies to identify and describe key type localities for specific industrial and urban pollution sources and (b) further exploration of the wealth of information contained within the EA database, is highlighted. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI NEW RESULTS FOR SELF-SIMILAR TREES WITH APPLICATIONS TO RIVER NETWORKS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In a little-known series of papers beginning in 1966, Tokunaga introduced an infinite class of tree graphs based on the Strahler ordering scheme. As recognized by Tokunaga (1984), these trees are characterized by a self-similarity property, so we will refer to them as self-similar trees, or SSTs. SSTs are defined in terms of a generator matrix which acts as a ''blueprint'' for constructing different trees. Many familiar tree constructions are absorbed as special cases. However, in Tokunaga's work an additional assumption is imposed which restricts from SSTs to a much smaller class. We will refer to this subclass as Tokunaga's trees. This,paper presents several new and unifying results for SSTs. In particular, the conditions under which SSTs have well-defined Horton-Strahler stream ratios are given, as well as a general method for computing these ratios. It is also shown that the diameters of SSTs grow like m(beta), where m is the number of leaves. In contrast to many other tree constructions, here beta need not equal 1/2; thus SSTs offer an explanation for Hack's law. Finally, it is demonstrated that large discrepancies exist between the predictions of Shreve's well-known model and detailed measurements for large river networks, while other SSTs fit the data quite well. Other potential applications of the SST framework include diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), lightning, bronchial passages, neural networks, and botanical trees.

DE cultural history; film; moving images; music video; sensual experience
AB Throughout the history of cinema, water has beenand still isomnipresent in various forms. The relationship between water and moving images extends to multiple levels. First and foremost, there are interesting theoretical implications: Water and the ways it can be perceived pose an apt analogy to conceptualize how the sensual relationship between moving images and the viewer can be understood. This approach is based on the analysis of aesthetical forms that stage water and expose fluidity in moving images. The study of numerous film examplesas well as of some recent music videosshows that the dissolution of stable distinctions between what is perceived as reality and what as a dream becomes crucial: the transitions become literally fluid within the images. This leads to the investigation of how films position the human subject in relation to unreliable, fluid mirrors. Moreover, the human body can also be shown as fully immersed in liquid spaces. Such floating bodies are often staged within specific settings such as swimming pools or aquariums. As an extreme existential form, the drowned body plays a significant role in cultural history. Finally, the discussion of the physical and tactile experience in aquatic surroundings and cinema's voyeurism leads to the topic of eroticism. The potential of audio-visual images to convey the experience of fluidity of time and space is pivotal for the specific imaginary and for the sensual and corporal perception mode in which we not only see but actually feel films.

DT Article
AB Water resource projects are often jointly carried out by a number of communities and agencies. Participation in a joint project depends on how costs are allocated among the participants and how cost shares compare with the cost of independent projects. Cooperative N-person game theory offers approaches which yield cost allocations that satisfy rationality conditions favoring participation. A new solution concept, the normalized nucleolus, is discussed and applied to a water reuse project in southern California. Results obtained with the normalized nucleolus are compared with those derived with more traditional solution concepts, namely, the nucleolus and the Shapley value.

AB The export of freshwater from the Arctic Ocean (AO) is an important modifier of themohaline circulation in the North Atlantic and ultimately global climate. Arctic river discharge is known to be the most important source of freshwater to the AO but considerable variation about its magnitude exists in the Literature. A reanalysis of all available data showed that the major source of variation is differences in the geographical definition of the receiving body. The contributing area to inflow relationship was also found to be remarkably linear for the major spatial definitions of the AO "catchment", Precise catchment and receiving area boundaries of the AO need to be properly defined before freshwater components are calculated or compared.

AB A statistical analysis of the rate coefficient of nonaqueous phase liquid dissolution in porous media is performed based on general functional correlation relationships found in literature. The input variables are treated as random and assumed to be lognormally distributed. The dissolution rate coefficient statistics are derived theoretically, and the influence of various parameters and their uncertainties are examined and discussed. The impact of uncertainties in the mean grain diameter is found to be the greatest on the dissolution rate coefficient uncertainties.

AB An analog method is used to simulate a discrete transmissivity field free of the artifacts inherent in conventional multivariate Gaussian statistical generation methods.  The simulated field provides a realistic model of a formation exhibiting the spatial continuity of extreme transmissivities which gives rise to barriers and preferential channels for flow.  The heterogeneous transmissivity field and the corresponding steady-state head and discharge fields are characterized in a geostatistical framework and observed spatial statistics are compared with theoretical results from the stochastic hydrogeology literature.  The simulated transmissivity field exhibits a bimodal distribution and strong directional anisotropy with nested scales of heterogeneity.  Despite these significant departures from standard models, the observed head covariance and head-log transmissivity cross-covariance agree well with theory.  The spatial covariance of specific discharge is highly anisotropic reflecting preferential channeling in the mean direction of flow and the conservation of flux along streamlines.  The effective transmissivity of the field is predicted more accurately by the spatial geometric average than by theoretical models despite the flow channeling and the anisotropy of heterogeneity.  Tracer spreading, modeled by particle tracking, is non-Fickian at displacements of up to 13.4 times the log-transmissivity integral range because transport behavior is dominated by convection along a small number of preferential channels.  The observed scale dependence of apparent longitudinal dispersivity is predicted generally well by theory.  Results of this study suggest that ensemble theoretical models based on perturbation approaches can provide reasonable estimates of general flow and transport properties of single field realizations under moderate conditions of heterogeneity.

AB Drainage networks generated with a simulation model based on the scaling relationship between slopes and areas were found to have total energy expenditure values very near the minimum value of optimal channel networks. Using this model to grow networks inside the boundaries of real basins, it is shown that the drainage networks identified with the aid of digital elevation maps in such basins tend to organize themselves in configurations that minimize total energy expenditure. The role of perturbations in the search for configurations with lower energy and the existence of unstable equilibrium landscapes are also examined.

AB A dome-shaped layer can be selected as a storage site for fluid injection. In this study, we develop a mathematical model for simulating transient head distribution in a heterogeneous and anisotropic dome-shaped layer due to a constant-head injection in a fully penetrating well. In the model, a form of step change is adopted to approximate the upper and lower boundaries of the dome and then the layer is split into two regions. The Laplace-domain solution of the model is developed using the Laplace transform and method of separation of variables. The transient injection rate at wellbore can then be obtained based on Darcy's law and Bromwich integral method. The predicted head contours from the head solution show significant vertical flow components near the location of step change in the dome reservoir. The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the hydraulic conductivity is the most sensitive parameter and the specific storage is the least sensitive one to the injection rate after a short period of injection time. In addition, the injection rate for a dome reservoir is also very sensitive to the change of the height for the reservoir near the injection well (first region) at a very early injection time. In contrast, the injection rate is more sensitive to the change of the height of the second region than that of the first region at late time. This analytical solution may be used as a primary tool to assess the capacity of fluid injection to various dome reservoirs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predictive performance is one of the most important issues for practical applications of ensemble hydroclimatic forecasts. While different forecasting studies tend to use different combinations of verification metrics and diagnostic plots, this paper presents a literature survey of popular verification metrics, diagnostic plots and their corresponding forecast attributes. Twenty metrics to quantify predictive performance of ensemble, deterministic and categorical forecasts are detailed; six types of diagnostic plots to visualize the relationship between ensemble forecasts and observations are presented; and the correspondence relationships of verification metrics and diagnostic plots with ten forecast attributes are illustrated. Numerical experiments are devised for raw ensemble precipitation forecasts generated by the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) to illustrate the verification metrics, diagnostic plots and forecast attributes. The results suggest that verification metrics that pay attention to some similar attributes can be related to one another. Meanwhile, the metrics are not necessarily in full accordance as they tend to reflect different attributes. Time series plots visualize forecasts over a period of interest and graphically illustrate forecast bias, reliability and skill. Quantile range plots provide an overall diagnosis for the association of ensemble forecasts with observations. Overall, verification metrics can be illustrated by diagnostic plots for individual grid cells and also be screened by spatial plots at regional and global scales. The survey presented in this article can serve as a roadmap for the selection of verification metrics, diagnostic plots and forecast attributes for verifying ensemble hydroclimatic forecasts.

AB Mobile colloids in groundwater aquifers and Soils can serve as carriers for strongly sorbing contaminants and thereby facilitate contaminant transport. Therefore mobile colloids may have to be considered in modeling the fate of strongly sorbing contaminants in subsurface environments. In this study we present a chromatographic short-pulse technique for measuring colloid deposition rate coefficients and experimental collision efficiencies in natural porous media. The method was evaluated using four different experimental systems of increasing complexity. Short pulses (equivalent to 0.002 to 0.03 pore volumes) of latex or humic-coated hematite suspensions were injected under saturated flow conditions into laboratory columns packed with glass beads, soil, or aquifer materials. Colloid breakthrough curves were measured on-line using fluorescence and UV-VIS spectrophotometers. Deposition rate coefficients determined with the short-pulse method were in excellent agreement with results from step-input experiments. Experiments with different flow rates and column dimensions showed that colloid deposition generally followed a first-order kinetic rate law. On the basis of experimental fast deposition rates, collision efficiencies for colloid deposition can be calculated. The results demonstrate that the short-pulse method can be used very efficiently for studying the effects of solution chemistry and flow velocity on the kinetics of colloid deposition in natural porous media. The short-pulse method has several advantages over the more traditionally used step-input experiment, and allows running several experiments on a single column without significant blocking or filter ripening effects.

AB A fracture simulation model which incorporates the physics of fracture growth is used to investigate how the mechanics of fracture formation affect the flow characteristics of fractured systems. Fractures are assumed to grow subcritically with the growth rate given by a power law function of the energy available for fracture growth. mow characteristics are quantified in terms-of the percent of networks percolating and the average effective conductivity as a function of the fracture density. For all flaw densities considered and for values of the growth rate exponent alpha less than or equal to 1, the flow characteristics primarily depend on the fracture spatial density and are similar to the flow characteristics of networks generated stochastically by assuming the fractures are randomly located. For alpha much greater than 1, the mechanical interaction of the flaws and fractures imparts an organized structure to the network resulting in isolated fractures, or zones of fractures, which form extensive, connected pathways at significantly lower fracture densities. Experimentally measured values of alpha for subcritical fracture growth are typically greater than one, suggesting that the flow characteristics of randomly located fractures may not be representative of natural fracture networks thought to have grown subcritically. An. analysis of published fracture trace maps suggests that many natural fracture networks have fracture spatial densities near the percolation threshold. It is suggested that this may be due to the existence of a self-limiting mechanism in fracture network formation.

AB The scaling properties of channel-forming flows are investigated using a regional flow frequency model developed for snowmelt-dominated streams in Colorado. The model is derived from analyses of daily flow records at 32 gauging stations where we have independent measurements of the bankfull discharge. The study sites are located in alpine/subalpine basins with drainage areas ranging from 4 to 3700 km(2). The frequency distribution of daily flows at these locations can be reproduced with a broken power law (BPL) function described by two free parameters. Both parameters are strongly correlated with drainage area, and based on these correlations, a regional model capable of predicting the frequency of daily flows above the mean annual flow was formulated. The applicability of the model was tested using daily flow records from 32 similar-size basins in Idaho. The frequency distributions of daily flows in snowmelt-dominated streams in Colorado and Idaho with highly predictable hydrographs (i.e., 1 year autocorrelation above 0.7) are well fitted by the BPL function. According to the model, the frequency of flows greater than bankfull decreases downstream from about 15 d/yr in headwater reaches to about 6 d/yr in downstream reaches. These results imply that the basin response to precipitation and runoff is nonlinear. This multiscaling behavior can be physically interpreted as the result of scale-dependent variations in runoff and sediment supply, which influence downstream trends in the bankfull channel geometry and intensity of sediment transport.

AB We report results of laboratory experiments on the co-transport of Cs-137 by inorganic colloids composed of kaolinite. We find that under condition's of low pore, water ionic strength, the kaolinite colloids significantly accelerate Cs-137 transport through columns packed with quartz sand. Kaolinite mobility and the affinity of kaolinite for binding Ca diminish with increasing ionic strength. As a result, kaolinite exerts a progressively smaller influence on Cs transport as the ionic strength increases from 0.002 to 0.1 m. The Cs-137 breakthrough data are used to test a model that incorporates advection-dispersion equations for the movement of kaolinite colloids, dissolved Cs-137, and kaolinite-associated Cs-137 and mass transfer equations for kaolinite deposition, Cs-137 adsorption by kaolinite, and Cs-137 adsorption by quartz sand. The partition coefficient fdr Cs-137 retention by kaolinite colloids and the first-order rate coefficient for kaolinite deposition vary in a discernible fashion with changes in ionic strength. The adsorption rate coefficient and the sorption capacity term of the second order rate law taken to describe Cs-137 adsorption to the quartz sand are independent of ionic strength; however, the magnitude of the desorption coefficient Varies logarithmically with ionic strength. This work indicates the need to account for enhanced movement of sorbing solutes by inorganic colloids and provides a basis for quantifying the response of colloid-associated Solute transport to changes hi pore water chemistry.

AB An analytical model is proposed to describe lake drainage and downstream flooding due to the gradual breaching of natural and manmade earthen dams. Erodible triangular dams are considered, undergoing gradual incision by a breaching channel of constant effective width. Adopting a simple stream power law for dam material transport, the long profile evolution of the breaching channel is governed by a diffusion equation with variable diffusion rate, proportional to the water discharge. The resulting flood is routed downstream using the kinematic wave equation. Moving boundary problems are obtained due to retrogression of the breach crest, and to the downstream propagation of the flood wavefront. For both the dam breaching and flood routing problems, explicit analytical solutions are derived. They depict a breaching process that is at first self-accelerating, then becomes self-limiting. Results include boundary paths, long profiles, and stage and discharge hydrographs. In particular, the breaching solution yields a discharge hydrograph of simple analytical shape that turns out to be ideally suited for kinematic wave routing. The model is applied to the well-documented breaching of the Tangjiashan landslide dam, Sichuan, in June 2008. Calculated results for this and other cases are in reasonably good agreement with the measured data. As the model is simple to apply, with minimal computational and data requirements, it could prove useful as a tool for rapid risk assessment. The proposed analytical approach also complements numerical models by providing more transparent links between solution outcomes and the problem data.

AB Consistent relationships between groundwater conditions and topographic properties in small drainage basins would assist the study and modelling of basin hydrology and hydrochemistry. Hydrochemical simulation using topographically based models would benefit in particular from the linkage of groundwater residence times to topographic indices, such as the ln(a/tanbeta) index of Beven and Kirkby. Hypothesized associations between this index and groundwater characteristics were tested during the spring 2000 snowmelt in two sub-basins in the Turkey Lakes Watershed near Sault Ste Marie, ON. One sub-basin is in mature hardwood forest, and the other was clearcut in the fall of 1997. Piezometric surface elevations were monitored in each sub-basin throughout the melt, and the topographic index value for each piezometer was determined. The delta(18)O signatures of input water and groundwater were also measured. Mean groundwater residence times were obtained using the exponential system response function, which generally produced good fits to the observed groundwater delta(18)O time series in both sub-basins. There were significant contrasts in groundwater conditions between the sub-basins. The forested sub-basin exhibited higher and more temporally variable piezometric surface elevations and a greater contrast between 8180 signatures and water residence times in shallow versus deeper groundwater relative to the harvested sub-basin. Patterns of groundwater residence times in the sub-basins were supported by pre-harvest groundwater chemistry; however, data from the two sub-basins largely failed to support the hypothesized relationships between groundwater conditions and topographic index values. Methodological limitations that may have precluded a more rigorous test of the hypotheses are reviewed, and the potential for using groundwater residence times to evaluate the impacts of forest harvesting on basin hydrochemistry is briefly discussed.

AB Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is an effective strategy for water resources management and has been widely used in many contaminated and saline aquifers. However, its recovery efficiency (RE) may be significantly affected by mass transfer limitations. A numerical model is developed to simulate ASR performance by combining the convergent and divergent dispersion models with a first-order mass transfer model. By analyzing the concentration history at the pumping well, we obtain simple and effective relationships for investigating ASR efficiency under various mass transfer parameters, including capacity ratio and mass transfer timescale, and operational parameters, including injection durations and well-pumping rates. On the basis of such relationships, one can conveniently determine whether a site with mass transfer limitations is appropriate or not for ASR and how many ASR cycles are required for achieving a positive RE. Results indicate that the immobile domain may function as a contaminant source or sink or both during the recovery phase and RE usually improves with well-flow rate, the decrease of capacity ratio, and the ASR cycles. However, RE is a nonmonotonic function of the mass transfer timescale and the injection duration. A critical timescale is given for quantifying this nonmonotonic behavior. When the injection period is greater than such a critical value, increasing injection period results in a higher RE. Contrarily, when the injection period is less than the critical value, increasing the injection period may even yield a lower RE.

AB Transient storage constitutes a key element in the hydrologic cycle of watersheds. Both in-channel slow moving water (dead zones) and hyporheic zones can contribute to transient storage, which retains water and solutes, increases residence time and influences solute transport in streams. Beaver dams and other in-stream obstructions throughout low-order streams attenuate streamflow and provide dead zone storage in pools. In this article, we report the results of four tracer tests in nested stream reaches in Cherry Creek (Wyoming, USA) covering similar to 2-5 km of stream length to explore how the degree of beaver dam obstructions and their impoundments influence water transient storage and downstream solute transport in low-order streams in the Rocky Mountain region of the American West. Travel-time parameters for the tracer tests increased linearly with beaver dam number (N) and pond size (V). Linear regression of the travel time to the peak concentration (T(p)), the leading (T(l)) and tailing edge (T(t)) of the dye cloud and the duration of the dye cloud (T(d)) versus N and V were all significant (R(2) = 0.99). Slopes of the linear regressions of T(t) versus N and V, were three times larger than those for T(l), suggesting that longer residence times may be caused, in part, by transient storage in the stream system. One-dimensional transport with inflow and storage (OTIS) modelled cross-sectional area of transient storage zone (A(s)) and dispersion coefficients (D) increased linearly with N and V and reach length. Two transient storage metrics, F(mean) and F(med)(200), also showed a general increase with N and V, although the relationship was not as strong. This suggests that in-channel dead zones associated with beaver dams provide opportunities for generating transient water storage.

AB Representation of sub-element scale variability in snow accumulation and ablation is increasingly recognized as important in distributed hydrologic modelling. Representing sub-grid scale variability may be accomplished through numerical integration of a nested grid or through a lumped modelling approach. We present a physically based model of the lumped snowpack mass and energy balance applied to a 26-ha rangeland catchment with high spatial variability in snow accumulation and melt. Model state variables are snow-covered area average snow energy content (U), the basin-average snow water equivalence (W-a), and snow-covered area fraction (A(f)) The energy state variable is evolved through an energy balance. The snow water equivalence state variable is evolved through a mass balance, and the area state variable is updated according to an empirically derived relationship, A(f)(W-a), that is similar in nature to depletion curves used in existing empirical basin snowmelt models. As snow accumulates, the snow covered area increases rapidly. As the snowpack ablates, A(f) decreases as W-a decreases. This paper shows how the relationship A(f)(W-a) for the melt season can be estimated from the distribution of snow water equivalence at peak accumulation in the area being modelled. We show that the depletion curve estimated from the snow distribution of peak accumulation at the Upper Sheep Creek sub-basin of Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed compares well against the observed depletion data as well as modelled depletion data from an explicit spatially distributed energy balance model. Comparisons of basin average snow water equivalence between the lumped model and spatially distributed model show good agreement. Comparisons to observed snow water equivalence show poorer but still reasonable agreement. The sub-grid parameterization is easily portable to other physically based point snowmelt models. It has potential application for use in hydrologic and climate models covering large areas with large model elements, where a computationally inexpensive parameterization of sub-grid snow processes may be important.

TI 'SAMP' model for water and solute movement in unsaturated porous media
   involving thermodynamic subsystems and moving packets .1. Theory
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SOILS
AB SAMP (subsystems and moving packets) is a new type of model for simulating non-steady movement of water in unsaturated porous media under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, and the associated movement of a non-sorbing solute. It can be used in many types of simulations, including: solving Richards' equation; advection and dispersion of solute in a medium containing dead-space; preferential water and solute movement in a medium containing macropores and determining the fate of 'new' and 'old' water and solute when the new enters a region containing the old. The model is approximate in that the modelled region is divided into cells, and discrete packets of water (which may contain solute) are moved within and between these cells, and stochastic in that each move is determined by probability calculations and the use of random numbers. The pore space within each cell is divided into 100 or more distinct independent thermodynamic subsystems, and the internal moisture state of a cell is described by a binary number: bit i of this number is 1 when subsystem i is saturated (i.e. contains a packet) and 0 when it is dry. The basic parameters of the model are those for the matric potential and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (equilibrium) functions, as used with Richards' equation. Property data for each subsystem are derived from the equilibrium functions and these data are assumed to apply even under non-equilibrium conditions. The only further parameter is the internal scale, X. The necessary new theory is developed here, and the design of a 1-dimensional SAMP model is described in Ewen (1996. J. Hydrol., 182: 195-207), where typical results are also given. These results demonstrate the role of lambda in controlling the efficiency with which old water is displaced by new water, and the degree to which there is non-equilibrium movement.

AB A model is proposed in which the cumulative load of an ion infiltrating into frozen unsaturated soil can be estimated as a function of meltwater ion concentration and infiltration rate. Assumptions of the model are that the meltwater solution released to the soil surface is conservative, fully mixed within each time step, and that mass and energy are conserved. Infiltration and meltwater concentration are estimated using relationships developed by Gray and Stein respectively. The model suggests that the relationship between ion concentration and volume of infiltration is non-linear with a positive covariance. Infiltration of snowmelt ions is therefore a function of the products of the mean concentration in the meltwater and the cumulative volume of water that infiltrates, plus the covariance between instantaneous values of ion concentration and infiltration rate. This covariance effect is termed enhanced infiltration. Meteorological observations and soil parameters from four sites in western Canada were used to assess the sensitivity of the model to conditions at a prairie site, a boreal forest site, a mountain forest site, and a shrub tundra site. Model results showed the greatest cumulative infiltration of ion load for the Prairie site; the general ranking was Prairie > Mountain Forest > Boreal Forest > Tundra. However, the greatest impact of enhanced infiltration was found for the Tundra site. At this site, enhanced infiltration caused up to 50% more ion load to infiltrate within the initial third of the melt period compared to infiltration estimates not accounting for this effect. Over the whole melt period, enhanced infiltration caused 55-160% more ion load to infiltrate than estimates based solely on the mean depth of infiltration and ion concentration. Sensitivity analysis showed that enhanced infiltration varies most strongly with initial snow water equivalent, average melt rate over the whole melt period, and snowpack ion elution concentration factor (CF).

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRAZIL ICE; RIVER ICE; SIMULATION; RAINFALL; COVER;
   VARIABILITY
AB [1] This paper presents artificial neural network ( ANN) models designed to predict ice in Canadian lakes and reservoirs during the early winter ice thickness growth period. The models fit ice thickness measurements at one or more monitored lakes and predict ice thickness during the growth period either at the same locations for dates without measurements ( local ANN models) or at any site in the region ( regional ANN model), provided that the required meteorological input variables are available. The input variables were selected after preliminary assessments and were adapted from time series of daily mean air temperature, rainfall, cloud cover, solar radiation, and average snow depth. The results of the ANN models compared well with those of the deterministic physics-driven Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMO) in terms of root-mean-square error and in terms of relative root-mean-square errors. The ANN models predictions were also marginally more precise than a revised version of Stefan's law (RSL), presented herein. They reproduced some intrawinter and interannual growth rate fluctuations that were not accounted for by RSL. The performance of the models results in good part from a careful choice of input variables, inspired from the work on deterministic models such as CLIMO. ANN models of ice thickness show good potential for the use in contexts where ad hoc adjustments are desirable because of the limited availability of measurements and where poor data nature, availability, and quality precludes using deterministic physics-driven models.

   preferential flow
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID POROUS ROCK; NONEQUILIBRIUM; SOILS; MODEL
AB The impact of preferential flow on recharge and contaminant transport poses a considerable challenge to water-resources management. Typical hydrologic models require extensive site characterization, but can underestimate fluxes when preferential flow is significant. A recently developed source-responsive model incorporates film-flow theory with conservation of mass to estimate unsaturated-zone preferential fluxes with readily available data. The term source-responsive describes the sensitivity of preferential flow in response to water availability at the source of input. We present the first rigorous tests of a parsimonious formulation for simulating water table fluctuations using two case studies, both in arid regions with thick unsaturated zones of fractured volcanic rock. Diffuse flow theory cannot adequately capture the observed water table responses at both sites; the source-responsive model is a viable alternative. We treat the active area fraction of preferential flow paths as a scaled function of water inputs at the land surface then calibrate the macropore density to fit observed water table rises. Unlike previous applications, we allow the characteristic film-flow velocity to vary, reflecting the lag time between source and deep water table responses. Analysis of model performance and parameter sensitivity for the two case studies underscores the importance of identifying thresholds for initiation of film flow in unsaturated rocks, and suggests that this parsimonious approach is potentially of great practical value.

AB This study characterized the hydrologic regimes at four forested, mountainous long-term ecological research (LTER) sites: H.J. Andrews (Oregon), Coweeta (North Carolina), Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire), and Luquillo (Puerto Rico). Over 600 basinyears of daily streamflow records were examined from 18 basins that have not experienced human disturbances since at least the 1930s and in some cases much longer periods. This study used statistical methods to systematically evaluate the relationship between precipitation and streamflow at a range of spatial and temporal scales, and draw inferences from these relationships about the hydrologic behavior of the basins. Basins in this study had fundamentally different abilities to store and release moisture at a range of time and space scales. These different hydrologic regimes are the result of different types of forest canopies, snow, and soils in the study basins. Through their influences on interception and transpiration, forest canopies appear to play a very important role in the hydrologic regimes at Andrews and Luquillo, but at Coweeta and Hubbard Brook, the current deciduous forest plays a more limited although seasonally important role. Because of the timing of melt and its interaction with soils, seasonal snowpacks at Hubbard Brook and Andrews have quite different effects upon streamflow and vegetation water use. A variety of water flowpath types in soil, from macropore flow to long flowpaths in deep soils or fractured bedrock, appear to operate at the four sites. Hydrologic regimes may help predict the temporal scales of biogeochemical cycling and stream ecological processes, as well as the magnitude and timing of hydrologic response to disturbance and climate change in headwater basins.

AB The results of experimental and analytical investigations of the movement of lighter than water organic liquids in the vadose zone are presented. The experiments consisted of physical model tests simulating nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) spills in unsaturated, two-dimensional domain above the water table. The evolution of the plume was observed through the transparent side of a tank containing sand, and the contaminant front was traced at appropriate intervals. Visual observations were supplemented with pressure and saturation measurements suitable for quantitative analysis of the process. The experiments show that during infiltration the front advances at constant speed (area/time). After spreading comes to a halt, the bulk of the contaminant is contained within a pancake-shaped lens situated on top of the capillary fringe. Fluctuations of the phreatic surface result in trapping the NAPL below the water table and in spreading the contaminant over a larger area. In layered samples, the behavior is largely geometry dependent, although heterogeneities invariably result in extensive horizontal spreading. Simplified analytical relationships were developed to estimate the spreading rate of the contaminant during infiltration and the thickness of the final immobilized oil lens observed during the experiments. These relationships are based on capillary pressure considerations, which have to be included in order to model the immobilization of the plume at saturations higher than the residual values, which typically occur in vadose zone, when the NAPL encounters the capillary fringe in its downward migration.

AB The transformation of rainfall into runoff is one of the most important processes in hydrology. In the past few decades, a wide variety of automated or computer-based approaches have been applied to model this process However. many such approaches have an important limitation in that they treat the rainfall-runoff process as a realization of only a few parameters of linear relationships rather than the process as a whole. What is required, therefore, is an approach that can capture not only the overall appearance but also the intricate details of the nonlinear behaviour of the process. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of understanding the dynamics of the rainfall-runoff process from a new perspective, as a chaotic process. The possible existence of chaotic behaviour in the rainfall-runoff process is studied by investigating the rainfall and runoff time series: (a) separately; and (b) jointly (using the runoff coefficient). Monthly rainfall and runoff observed over a period of 131 years (January 1807-December 1937) at the Gota River basin in the south of Sweden are analysed. The correlation dimension method is employed to identify the presence of chaos. Thr correlation dimensions obtained for the rainfall and runoff time series are 6.4 and 5.5, respectively. The finite dimensions obtained for the rainfall and runoff time series indicate the possible existence of chaos in these behaviour. The correlation dimension of about 7.8 obtained for the runoff coefficient also indicates the possible presence of chaos and supports the above results.

Precipitation from 1983-98 had significant (p < 0.05) decreases in concentrations of Ca2+ (-0.10 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Mg2+ (-0.07 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), K+ (-0.01 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Na+ (-0.04 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Cl- (-0.07 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), SO42- (-0.82 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)) and H+ (-0.55 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), whereas NH4+ and NO3- concentrations did not change. For the same period, there were decreases in solute concentrations in the Arbutus Lake outlet for Ca2+ (-1.18 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Mg2+ (-0.32 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), K+ (-0.33 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)), Cl- (-0.17 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)) and SO42- (-1.90 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)) and a significant increase in NH4+ concentrations (+0.07 mu mol(c) l(-1) year(-1)). For the period from 1995 through 1998 the discharge measurements for the outlet and the major inlet of Arbutus Lake were combined with weekly chemical measurements supplemented with storm sampling. At the inlet there were significant relationships (p < 0.05) between discharge rates and the concentrations of all solutes except Cl-, but only for Na+, NO3-, H+ and Al did these relationships explain more than 20% of the variation in solute concentrations. April had the greatest rates of discharge and solute Bur of any month due to spring snowmelt. The dormant season (October-May) accounted for > 80% of the discharge in the inlet and outlet of Arbutus Lake and > 78% of the flux of all solutes. For 1995-98 the mass balances of discharge losses from the catchment draining into Arbutus Lake inlet I versus precipitation inputs suggest that internal watershed processes resulted in net generation of Ca2+ (-1342 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)), Mg2+ (-313 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)), K+ (-35 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)), SO42- (-635 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)) and Cl- (-45 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)) and net retention of inorganic N solutes (NO3- + NH4+: 204 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)) and H+ (424 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1)). Concentrations and fluxes of Ca2+, H+, NO3-, SO42- and Al were lower at the lake outlet compared with the inlet. A comparison of mass balances at the Arbutus Lake inlet and outlet suggested that these decreases may have been due to within-lake biotic processes and/or dilution from other water sources to the lake.

SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER

DT Article
ID POPULATION; DYNAMICS; GROWTH
AB In 1960, von Foerster et al. humorously predicted an abrupt transition in human population growth to occur in the mid-21st century. Their so-called 'Doomsday' emerged from either progressive degradation of a finite resource or faster-than-exponential growth of an increasingly resource-use efficient population, though what constitutes this resource was not made explicit. At present, few dispute the claim that water is the most fundamental resource to sustainable human population growth. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that the global water system exhibits nontrivial dynamics linked to similar patterns in population growth. Projections of the global water system range from a finite carrying capacity regulated by accessible freshwater, or 'peak renewable water,' to punctuated evolution with new supplies and improved efficiency gained from technological and social innovation. These projections can be captured, to first order, by a single delay differential equation with human-water interactions parameterized as a delay kernel that links present water supply to the population history and its impacts on water resources. This kernel is a macroscopic representation of social, environmental, and technological factors operating in the human-water system; however, the mathematical form remains unconstrained by available data. A related model of log-periodic, power-law growth confirms that global water use evolves through repeated periods of rapid growth and stagnation, a pattern remarkably consistent with historical anecdotes. Together, these models suggest a possible regime shift leading to a new phase of water innovation in the mid-21st century that arises from delayed feedback between population growth and development of water resources.

AB Streamflow in the Himalayan rivers is generated from rainfall, snow and ice. The distribution of runoff produced from these sources is such that the streamflow may be observed in these rivers throughout the year, i.e. they are perennial in nature. Snow and glacier melt runoff contributes substantially to the annual flows of these rivers and its estimation is required for the planning, development and management of the water resources of this region. The average contribution of snow and glacier melt runoff in die annual flows of the Satluj River at Bhakra Dam has been determined. Keeping in view the availability of data for the study basin, a water balance approach was used and a water budget period of 10 years (October 1986-September 1996) was considered for the analysis. The rainfall input to the study basin over the water budget period was computed from isohyets using rainfall data of 10 stations located at different elevations in the basin. The total volume of flow for the same period was computed using observed flow data of the Satluj River at Bhakra Darn. A relationship between temperature and evaporation was developed and used to estimate the evapotranspiration losses. The snow-covered area, and its depletion with time, was determined using satellite data. It was found that the average contribution of snow and glacier runoff in the annual flow of the Satluj River at Bhakra Dam is about 59%, the remaining 41% being from rain.

AB This research combines mass transport theory with stochastic methods to derive a stochastic, variable flow, surface water quality model for water quality policy analysis. Steady-state flow assumptions and a series of differential equations reduce the information and number of equations required to completely specify the model. The newly developed hydrology model is applied to river salinity in the Colorado Basin to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative salt load reduction strategies in water quality management. Model results are used to illustrate the influence of salt load reduction, stochastic river flows, and water conservation on river water quality.

AB The heterogeneity and multi-scale characteristics of porous media (such as soil aquifers) bring a series of uncertainties in studying flow and solute transport. In particular, the mathematical representation of these physical processes at different temporal and spatial scales, that is, the constitutive equations and parameters, is largely varied, which creates grand challenges in multi-scale modeling and numerical simulation of flow and solute transport in porous media. In recent years, we acknowledge that at-scale models and simulations have been greatly progressed, which means that at each individual scale, the transport phenomena, numerical methods, and solvers have been developed and utilized at different levels. However, the long-standing problem, scale coupling between the pore- and Darcy-scale in porous media, has not been well resolved. In this review, we present an overview and classification of the current multi-scale models, aiming to understand small-scale flow and solute transport processes when/where needed in a larger system. This review begins with a brief introduction of the pore- and Darcy-scale theories. Two groups of multi-scale models that are state-of-the-art, based on the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes equation and the domain decomposition method, respectively, are explained in the context of research progress in model theory, numerical algorithms, and applications. Future research perspectives and challenges are also discussed from both modeling and application points of view. This review is expected to provide a fundamental understanding of flow and solute transport in porous media and concept of developing multi-scale models to bridge the gaps between processes in adjacent scales.

AB The study demonstrates spectral relationships in the time-frequency domain for one-dimensional groundwater flow in aquifers bounded by fluctuating boundaries. By nature, the solutions of spectral equations are non-linear complex functions. To determine hydraulic diffusivity in the governing equations, it is required that the data are collected from the spectra of water levels at the fluctuating boundaries and observation wells. Hydraulic diffusivity thus can be obtained by an iterative inverse approach. This paper presents an application in Pingtung County of Taiwan to determine the hydraulic diffusivity of a sandy aquifer under confined conditions. Spectral density function of water level obtained from tidal boundaries and observation wells are used to approximate hydraulic diffusivity, which yields an averaged value of 1(.)26 x 10(6) m(2)/h.

AB The complexity of hydrological systems and the necessary simplification of models describing these systems remain major challenges in hydrological modeling. Kirchner's (2009) approach of inferring rainfall and evaporation from discharge fluctuations by "doing hydrology backward" is based on the assumption that catchment behavior can be conceptualized with a single storage-discharge relationship. Here we test Kirchner's approach using a densely instrumented hydrologic measurement network spanning 24 geologically diverse subbasins of the Alzette catchment in Luxembourg. We show that effective rainfall rates inferred from discharge fluctuations generally correlate well with catchment-averaged precipitation radar estimates in catchments ranging from less than 10 to more than 1000 km(2) in size. The correlation between predicted and observed effective precipitation was 0.8 or better in 23 of our 24 catchments, and prediction skill did not vary systematically with catchment size or with the complexity of the underlying geology. Model performance improves systematically at higher soil moisture levels, indicating that our study catchments behave more like simple dynamical systems with unambiguous storage-discharge relationships during wet conditions. The overall mean correlation coefficient for all subbasins for the entire data set increases from 0.80 to 0.95, and the mean bias for all basins decreases from -0.61 to -0.35 mm d(-1). We propose an extension of Kirchner's approach that uses in situ soil moisture measurements to distinguish wet and dry catchment conditions.

AB We present an analytical solution for apparent effective transmissivity under radially convergent steady state flow conditions, produced by constant pumping from a single well of finite radius, r(w). Apparent effective transmissivity, T-e, is defined as the value that relates the expected values of flow and head gradient at a certain location. The domain is two-dimensional, of annular shape, and the size of the pumping well is explicitly taken into account. The solution for the steady state heads is obtained by solving the perturbed flow equation and substituting it into Darcy's law to obtain a consistent second-order expansion for T-e. We show that apparent effective transmissivity is a scalar for any choice of isotropic covariance model, with an expression given in integral form. Our main result is that T-e in a heterogeneous, statistically isotropic random held, under radial steady state flow conditions, is a monotonic increasing function of r (distance from the well) that rises from the harmonic mean of the point transmissivity. values (close to the well) and tends asymptotically towards the geometric mean (far from the well). The asymptotic value is reached at a distance of a few integral scales (1.5-2 for the Gaussian model and 3-5 for the exponential one).

TI The potential application of finite element modelling of floodplain
   inundation to predict patterns of overbank deposition
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOWS
AB Mathematical modelling of overbank inundation and flows faces many problems and is still in its infancy. Work to date has generally been restricted to small reaches. Large-scale models based on longer reaches of river channel are likely to be of greater value for engineering and flood plain management purposes, but the problems associated with the transition from small to large scales need to be assessed. A large-scale finite element model, RMA-2, has been applied to the flood plain of the lower reaches of the River Culm in southeast Devon, UK. Patterns of radiocaesium accumulation by overbank accretion during flood water inundation were used to assess the potential of using such models for explaining sedimentation rates and patterns. A strong correlation was found between values of the (137)Cs inventory and surface concentration and the predicted flood water patterns derived using the RMA-2 model. Except where recession pondage occurs, an inverse relationship existed between (137)Cs deposition and water depth. However, the discretization model developed cannot presently cope with large-scale compartmentalization of flows by barriers to flow and small-scale local features, such as ditches crossing the flood plain and the microtopography of the flood plain. This study appraises the potential for using the RMA-2 model to predict patterns of overbank deposition and represents an initial stage in the development of an integrated model of hydraulic and sediment dynamics.

   DISTRIBUTIONS; INTENSITY; DURATION; MODEL; STORMS
AB Recent hydrologic studies on multivariate stochastic analysis have indicated that copulas perform well for bivariate problems. In particular, the Frank family of Archimedean copulas has been a popular choice for a dependence model. However, there are limitations to extending such Archimedean copulas to trivariate and higher dimensions, with very specific restrictions on the kinds of dependencies that can be modeled. In this study, we examine a non-Archimedean copula from the Plackett family that is founded on the theory of constant cross-product ratio. It is shown that the Plackett family not only performs well at the bivariate level, but also allows a trivariate stochastic analysis where the lower-level dependencies between variables can be fully preserved while allowing for specificity at the trivariate level as well. The feasible range of Plackett parameters that would result in valid 3-copulas is determined numerically. The trivariate Plackett family of copulas is then applied to the study of temporal distribution of extreme rainfall events for several stations in Indiana where the estimated parameters lie in the feasible region. On the basis of a given rainfall depth and duration, conditional expectations of rainfall features such as expected peak intensity, time to peak, and percentage cumulative rainfall at 10% cumulative time increments are evaluated. The results of this study suggest that while the constant cross-product ratio theory was conventionally applied to discrete type random variables, it is also applicable to continuous random variables, and that it provides further flexibility for multivariate stochastic analyses of rainfall.

AB Saturated soil column experiments were conducted to explore the influence of colloid size and soil grain size distribution characteristics on the transport and fate of colloid particles in saturated porous media. Stable monodispersed colloids and porous media that are negatively charged were employed in these studies. Effluent colloid concentration curves and the final spatial distribution of retained colloids by the porous media were found to be highly dependent on the colloid size and soil grain size distribution. Relative peak effluent concentrations decreased and surface mass removal by the soil increased when the colloid size increased and the soil median grain size decreased. These observations were attributed to increased straining of the colloids; i.e., blocked pores act as dead ends for the colloids. When the colloid size is small relative to the soil pore sizes, straining becomes a less significant mechanism of colloid removal and attachment becomes more important. Mathematical modeling of the colloid transport experiments using traditional colloid attachment theory was conducted to highlight differences in colloid attachment and straining behavior and to identify parameter ranges that are applicable for attachment models. Simulated colloid effluent curves using fitted first-order attachment and detachment parameters were able to describe much of the effluent concentration data. The model was, however, less adequate at describing systems which exhibited a gradual approach to the peak effluent concentration and the spatial distribution of colloids when significant mass was retained in the soil. Current colloid xfiltration theory did not adequately predict the fitted first-order attachment coefficients, presumably due to straining in these systems.

AB The with/without principle of cost-benefit analysis is examined for the possible bias that it brings to water resource planning. Theory and examples for this question are established. Because benchmarking against the demonstrably low without-project hurdle can detract from economic welfare and can fail to promote efficient policy, improvement opportunities are investigated. In lieu of the traditional, without-project benchmark, a second-best-based ''difference-making benchmark'' is proposed. The project authorizations and modified review processes instituted by the U.S. Water Resources Development Act of 2007 may provide for renewed interest in these findings.

   through porous media: variational inequality approach - Part I
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB A survey is presented of work done using variational inequalities in solving free-boundary problems arising in the filtration of liquids through porous materials. In 1971 Baiocchi proposed this new method for solving such problems. This method proved effective not only from the purely theoretical point of view, that is, for proving the existence and uniqueness of a solution, but also from the point of view of yielding new, simple and efficient numerical solution schemes. This new method was systematically and extensively developed by mathematicians at the Laboratory of Numerical Analysis at the National Research Centre in collaboration with the Institute of Hydraulics of the University of Pavia. The aim of this survey is to present the basic ideas of this method, its applications, and other problems to which various researchers have extended the method. Also, the paper is written in such a manner as to be understood by a more general audience other than mathematicians, who are the ones who have done the majority of work in this area.

ID NONSTATIONARY STOCHASTIC-ANALYSIS; LOCALIZED ANALYSES; MEDIA
AB [1] We consider steady state unsaturated flow in bounded, randomly heterogeneous soils under the influence of random boundary and source terms. Our aim is to predict pressure heads and fluxes without resorting to Monte Carlo simulation, upscaling, or linearization of the constitutive relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and pressure head. We represent this relationship through Gardner's exponential model while treating its exponent a as a random constant and saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s as a spatially correlated random field. We linearize the steady state unsaturated flow equations by means of the Kirchhoff transformation and integrate them in probability space to obtain exact integro-differential equations for the conditional mean and variance-covariance of transformed pressure head and flux. After approximating these equations recursively to second order in the standard deviation sigma(Y) of Y = ln K-s, we solve them by finite elements for superimposed mean uniform and divergent flows in the vertical plane, with and without conditioning on measured Y values. Comparison with Monte Carlo solutions demonstrates that whereas our nonlocal solution is nominally restricted to mildly nonuniform media with sigma(Y)(2) much less than 1, it yields remarkably accurate results for strongly nonuniform media with sigma(Y)(2) at least as large as 2. This accords well with a previous theoretical analysis, which shows that the solution may remain asymptotic for values of sigma(Y)(2) as large as 2.

AB In this paper a new and efficient control method based on fuzzy logic is proposed for real-time operation of spillway gates of a reservoir during any flood of any magnitude up to the probable maximum flood. Artificial neural networks are used to model the non-linear relationship among the main variables of the reservoir under consideration. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we simulate the control system using different probable overflow hydrographs. The results of the proposed control method are compared with the results of the conventional control methods. The results obtained from the simulations indicate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance over the conventional reservoir flood operation, with much more flexible results.

AB Water temperature is a non-conservative tracer in the environment. Variations in recharge temperature are damped and retarded as water moves through an aquifer due to heat exchange between water and rock. However, within karst aquifers, seasonal and short-term fluctuations in recharge temperature are often transmitted over long distances before they are fully damped. Using analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we develop relationships that describe the effect of flow path properties, flow-through time, recharge characteristics, and water and rock physical properties on the damping and retardation of thermal peaks/troughs in karst conduits. Using these relationships, one can estimate the thermal retardation and damping that would occur under given conditions with a given conduit geometry. Ultimately, these relationships can be used with thermal damping and retardation field data to estimate parameters such as conduit diameter. We also examine sets of numerical simulations where we relax some of the assumptions used to develop these relationships, testing the effects of variable diameter, variable velocity, open channels, and recharge shape on thermal damping and retardation to provide some constraints on uncertainty. Finally, we discuss a multitracer experiment that provides some field confirmation of our relationships. High temporal resolution water temperature data are required to obtain sufficient constraints on the magnitude and timing of thermal peaks and troughs in order to take full advantage of water temperature as a tracer.

AB Nitrous oxide fluxes and denitrification rates were measured in situ over a Vear at a riparian site in the UK. An exponential relationship was found between denitrification rates and soil moisture, with a sharp increase in denitrification rate at a water-filled pore space of 60-80%. Similar relationships were found in other studies compiled for comparison. The present Study is unique in measuring denitrification in all 'intact' ecosystem in the field, rather than in cores in the field or the lab. The exponential relationship between denitrification rate and soil moisture, with a 'threshold' at 60-80% water-filled pore space (20-40% gravimetric moisture). has proven to be comparable across a wide range of ecosystems, treatments and study conditions. Whereas moisture content determines the potential for denitrilication. the absolute rate of denitrification is determined by available nitrate (NO3-) dissolved organic carbon and temperature. As a first approximation, denitrification rates can be simply modelled by using a general exponential relationship between denitrification potential and water-filled pore space (or volumetric/gravimetric water content) multiplied by a constant value determined by the nitrogen status of the site. As such, it is recommended that the current relationship used in INCA to relate denitrification to soil moisture be amended to all exponential form, with a threshold of approximately 70% for the onset of denitrification.

ID UNITED-STATES; MODEL
AB Streamflow modeling is an enormously challenging problem, due to the complex and nonlinear interactions between climate inputs and landscape characteristics over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. A basic idea in streamflow studies is to establish connections that generally exist, but attempts to identify such connections are largely dictated by the problem at hand and the system components in place. While numerous approaches have been proposed in the literature, our understanding of these connections remains far from adequate. The present study introduces the theory of networks, in particular complex networks, to examine the connections in streamflow dynamics, with a particular focus on spatial connections. Monthly streamflow data observed over a period of 52 years from a large network of 639 monitoring stations in the contiguous US are studied. The connections in this streamflow network are examined primarily using the concept of clustering coefficient, which is a measure of local density and quantifies the network's tendency to cluster. The clustering coefficient analysis is performed with several different threshold levels, which are based on correlations in streamflow data between the stations. The clustering coefficient values of the 639 stations are used to obtain important information about the connections in the network and their extent, similarity, and differences between stations/regions, and the influence of thresholds. The relationship of the clustering coefficient with the number of links/actual links in the network and the number of neighbors is also addressed. The results clearly indicate the usefulness of the network-based approach for examining connections in streamflow, with important implications for interpolation and extrapolation, classification of catchments, and predictions in ungaged basins.

AB This paper presents two- and three-dimensional numerical solutions for the local closure problems associated with the two-equation model for heat transfer in porous media. Results are presented for the thermal dispersion tensors for both phases, in addition to the coupling dispersion tensors that appear naturally in the two-equation model. Results for the volumetric heat transfer coefficient are also given for Peclet numbers ranging from 0.1 to 1000. The longitudinal thermal dispersion coefficient for the one-equation model is compared with experimental data and a reasonably good agreement is obtained. The comparison between theory and experiment for the heat transfer coefficient is also promising. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Rain, throughfall, soil waters from surface peaty 0 horizon and deeper mineral B horizon, and stream water, were collected every four weeks for one year in a moorland catchment, and in four forested catchments. The four forested catchments represented an age sequence of first rotation Sitka spruce plantations, aged 14, 28, 37 and 53 years. All water samples were analysed for all major solutes, including dissolved organic nitrogen (DON-N); stream water and B horizon soil waters were also subjected to aluminium speciation. In each catchment, soil samples were collected on one occasion and pH was measured.
   Concentrations of most solutes were substantially higher in the 37 year old forest stand than in the moorland catchment, with intermediate concentrations in the two younger stands and 53 year old stand. In particular, higher nitrate-N concentrations were found in the soils and streams of the older forests, although these concentrations tended to be highest in the 37 year old stand. Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of soil waters was lower in the B horizon of the forest stands than in the moorland, and tended to decline with increasing forest age. Soil water from both 0 and B horizons was most acid in the 37 year old stand, and the water from the soil 0 horizon in all four forest stands was more acid than that in moorland sites. The pH of the soil itself (as measured in a deionised water slurry) was lower in the forest stands than in moorland, although trends with forest age were complex.

ID TRANSPORT; RIVERS
AB In the UK's upland catchments river terraces and alluvial features indicate a history of periodic aggradation and degradation linked to Holocene changes in land use (primarily deforestation) and climate change (altering flood frequency and magnitude). Although both factors are important, calculating their individual effects is complicated by the likelihood of their concurrent alteration.
   To investigate the relative impacts of land use and climate change, a cellular model is applied to the upland catchment of Cam Gill Beck, above Starbotton, North Yorkshire. This is divided into 1 million 2 m by 2 m grid cells, to which a range of process laws are applied. These include approximate expressions for mass movement rates, soil creep, the influence of vegetation and hillslope hydrology, as well as fluvial erosion and deposition in ten grain-size fractions. This provides a good representation of valley floor geometry while retaining a fully dynamic interaction with the surrounding valley sides. Previous applications of this model have shown the detailed formation of bars and berms as well as examples of braiding, avulsion and channel change.
   Running on a Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 computer, an ensemble of simulations were completed, bracketing a wide range of environmental scenarios involving changes in flood frequency, magnitude and vegetation cover. Over time-scales ranging from 10 to 100 years, these showed that decreasing tree cover and increasing rainfall magnitude individually produced similar 25% to 100% increases in sediment discharge, whereas in combination they generated a 1300% rise. Furthermore, channels formed by the model in response to increase rainfall magnitudes are located where relic channels are found in Cam Gill Beck, implying that these are the products of previous periods of high rainfall magnitudes.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
AB By including the constant flow of heat and fluid in the horizontal direction, we develop an analytical solution for the vertical temperature distribution within the semiconfining layer of a typical aquifer system. The solution is an extension of the previous one-dimensional theory by Bredehoeft and Papadopulos [1965]. It provides a quantitative tool for analyzing the uncertainty of the horizontal heat and fluid flow. The analytical results demonstrate that horizontal flow of heat and fluid, if at values much smaller than those of the vertical, has a negligible effect on the vertical temperature distribution but becomes significant when it is comparable to the vertical.

ID PRECIPITATION; ACCURACY
AB Quantitative rainfall forecasts obtained from interpretation of radar data can be of great interest in urban hydrology, provided their reliability is known in real time.  The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of an a priori estimation of forecast reliability from characteristics of rainfall areas and atmospheric vertical structure.  The first step has been to design a method to check the relevance of a criterion of forecasting quality to a particular application of the forecasts.  This method was applied to the case of real-time control of a drainage network in a suburban area of Paris, and led to the definition of a new quality criterion, consistent with the user's utility function.  Potential predictors of forecasting quality were then defined, to be calculated in real time from radar and rawinsonde data.  In the final step, statistical and heuristic techniques, applied to a learning set of examples taken from 46 rainfall events, provided decision rules which can be used in real time to estimate the quality of radar forecasts.  Although these rules are valid only in a specific operational context, the methodology is general, and can be transferred to other forecasting problems in hydrology, as well as in other domains.

AB In hydrological tracer studies, the gamma distribution can serve as an appropriate transit time distribution (TTD) as it allows more flexibility to account for nonlinearities in the behavior of catchment systems than the more commonly used exponential distribution. However, it is unclear which physical interpretation can be ascribed to its two parameters (alpha, beta). In this study, long-term tracer data from three contrasting catchments in the Scottish Highlands were used for a comparative assessment of interannual variability in TTDs and resulting mean transit times (MTT = alpha beta) inferred by the gamma distribution model. In addition, spatial variation in the long-term average TTDs from these and six additional catchments was also assessed. The temporal analysis showed that the b parameter was controlled by precipitation intensities above catchment-specific thresholds. In contrast, the a parameter, which showed little temporal variability and no relationship with precipitation intensity, was found to be closely related to catchment landscape organization, notably the hydrological characteristics of the dominant soils and the drainage density. The relationship between b and precipitation intensity was used to express b as a time-varying function within the framework of lumped convolution integrals to examine the nonstationarity of TTDs. The resulting time-variant TTDs provided more detailed and potentially useful information about the temporal dynamics and the timing of solute fluxes. It was shown that in the wet, cool climatic conditions of the Scottish Highlands, the transit times from the time-variant TTD were roughly consistent with the variations of MTTs revealed by interannual analysis.

The data analysis is focused on identification of (1) the effects of the spatial measuring scale on concentration estimates, (2) statistical and scaling properties of sediment concentration, and (3) relationships between near-bed turbulent flow and sediment motion. The obtained results are integrated into a conceptual model that can be instrumental in studying statistical properties of solid transport rate, which, in most cases, can be linearly associated with the particle concentration.

AB [ 1] The method of recession analysis proposed by Brutsaert and Nieber ( 1977) remains one of the few analytical tools for estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters at the field scale and beyond. In the method, the recession hydrograph is examined as -dQ/dt = f(Q), where Q is aquifer discharge and f is an arbitrary function. The observed function f is parameterized through analytical solutions to the one-dimensional Boussinesq equation for unconfined flow in a homogeneous and horizontal aquifer. While attractive in its simplicity, as originally presented it is not applicable to settings where slope is an important driver of flow, or where hydraulic parameters vary greatly with depth. We compare analytical solutions to the linearized one-dimensional Boussinesq equation for a sloping aquifer to numerical solutions of the full nonlinear equation. The behavior of the nonlinear Boussinesq equation is also assessed when the aquifer is heterogeneous wherein the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity k varies as a power law with height z above the impermeable layer (k similar to z(n), n constant >= 0). All of the analytical solutions differ in key aspects from the nonlinear solution when plotted as - dQ/ dt = f(Q) and thus are inappropriate for a Brutsaert and Nieber-type analysis. However, new analytical solutions for a sloping aquifer are derived "empirically'' from the numerical simulations that are applicable during the late period of recession when the recession curve converges to - dQ/dt = aQ(b), where b = (2n + 1)/(n + 1) and a is a function of the dimensions and hydraulic properties of the aquifer.

AB [1] Cross-well electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to monitor the migration of a saline tracer in a two-well pumping-injection experiment conducted at the Massachusetts Military Reservation in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. After injecting 2200 mg/L of sodium chloride for 9 hours, ERT data sets were collected from four wells every 6 hours for 20 days. More than 180,000 resistance measurements were collected during the tracer test. Each ERT data set was inverted to produce a sequence of 3-D snapshot maps that track the plume. In addition to the ERT experiment a pumping test and an infiltration test were conducted to estimate horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity values. Using modified moment analysis of the electrical conductivity tomograms, the mass, center of mass, and spatial variance of the imaged tracer plume were estimated. Although the tomograms provide valuable insights into field-scale tracer migration behavior and aquifer heterogeneity, standard tomographic inversion and application of Archie's law to convert electrical conductivities to solute concentration results in underestimation of tracer mass. Such underestimation is attributed to ( 1) reduced measurement sensitivity to electrical conductivity values with distance from the electrodes and ( 2) spatial smoothing ( regularization) from tomographic inversion. The center of mass estimated from the ERT inversions coincided with that given by migration of the tracer plume using 3-D advective-dispersion simulation. The 3-D plumes seen using ERT exhibit greater apparent dispersion than the simulated plumes and greater temporal spreading than observed in field data of concentration breakthrough at the pumping well.

AB Citizen science and particularly mobile crowd sourcing (MCS) has large potential in water resources management for data collection and awareness raising. Concerns about data quality, and initiating and sustaining citizen involvement hamper incorporation of citizen science in water monitoring, together with a lack of practical guidance how to set up citizen science monitoring programs. This review presents an overview of key success factors for citizen science including MCS. Specific attention is paid to motivational aspects. Success factors were organized according to project phase and motivations according to selfdetermination theory. The presented overviews provide practical guidelines for setting up citizen science projects. (C) 2017 The Authors. WIREs Water published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Water is imperative for nutrition and health, economic productivity, and political stability; it also holds cultural and symbolic meanings and functions. Household water insecurity is an emerging construct that captures lived experiences with water access, use, and acceptability. Although the plausibility of household water insecurity to "get under the skin" and shape human biology is high, these relationships have not been systematically investigated. Therefore, in this article, we set out to examine how household water insecurity and allied concepts affect health and human biology throughout the life course. We first lay out the various ways that water insecurity can act as a deleterious exposure, that is, through problematic quality, excess, and shortage. Next, we posit how water insecurity directly shapes human biology, as well as indirectly, via psychosocial stress precipitating cortisol exposure, with potential intergenerational effects. We highlight a range of established and plausible biological consequences using evidence from human and animal model studies. These include diarrheal prevalence, dehydration, stunting, food insecurity, gut microbiome alteration, malnutrition, psychosocial stress, adverse birth outcomes, lower cognitive function and performance, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. We also discuss the mechanisms by which household water insecurity may shape human biology across the life course; however, these pathways are just beginning to be understood. Longitudinal studies that simultaneously quantify household water insecurity and biological outcomes using comparable metrics in diverse environments and across generations will provide necessary evidence to establish causal relationships. Given the current global water crisis and its potential health consequences, such studies are urgently needed.

AB A project to link the Dead Sea to the Red Sea via a canal is undergoing extensive study. As part of this study, a method to estimate evaporation from the Dead Sea is required as it is a hypersaline lake in which standard methods cannot be applied. Two methods based on Penman and Dalton formulae were examined. The method derived here is a modified Penman model that estimates the evaporation as a function of salinity, humidity, air temperature and wind speed. Other parameters such as water temperature are included implicitly in the model. The results obtained were verified as satisfactory agreement was achieved by comparison with previous measurements. A short-cut relationship to estimate evaporation as: a-function of salinity only was also derived. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID FLUCTUATIONS; SOIL
AB The relationship between precipitation excess and water table depth can be described by empirical time series models such as transfer function noise models, autoregressive exogenous variable models (ARX), and threshold autoregressive self-exciting open loop models. In this paper these models are interpreted in terms of the water balance of a soil column. A physically based ARX model is used to predict the effect of an intervention on the water table dynamics at two locations. It is shown that the physically based ARX model predicts the effect of interventions reasonably well.

   NONSORBING SOLUTES; STREAM; TRANSPORT; FLOW; TIMESCALES; CHANNEL; ZONE
AB This study analyzes the effect of advective pumping and pore scale dispersion on bed form-induced hyporheic exchange. Advection and dispersion play a competitive role in the exchange dynamics between the porous medium and the overlying stream: Advective fluxes first lead solutes deep into the bed and then back to the stream water, whereas dispersive fluxes favor the transfer of solutes deep into the bed leading to a permanent mass retention. The combined effect of advective exchange and dispersive fluxes produces complexity in the shape of the tails of the residence time distributions (RTDs), which follow at various stages of the process either a power law or an exponential decay. The seepage velocity induced by the stream gradient and, in case of a moving bed, the celerity of the translating bed forms limit the thickness of the advective hyporheic zone, inducing the RTDs to decrease rapidly at late time. This rapid decay can be preceded by a temporal region where the probability density functions (pdf's) tend to be inversely proportional to the square of time, and is followed by a region dominated by dispersion where the pdf's tend to be inversely proportional to the 3/2 power of time. The process shows distinct temporal ranges identified here by appropriate dimensionless parameters. Because of this complex exchange dynamics, models considering pure advection in the porous medium can significantly underestimate solute transfer at long time scales, whereas purely diffusive models of hyporheic exchange appear inadequate to represent the physical processes at an intermediate stage.

AB A field tracer experiment was conducted in a lateral flow field in the weathered and highly fractured upper 6 m of a 40-m-thick clay-rich till plain in southwestern Ontario. In the upper 3 m where fractures are closely spaced (<0.13 m) the advancing front (C/C0 = 0.01) of the nonreactive solute tracers, bromide and O-18, migrated at rates of 0.01 to 0.07 m/d, over distances of 4 and 6 m and under a lateral hydraulic gradient of 0.24. In this same zone, two strains of colloid-sized bacteriophage tracers migrated at rates of 2 to > 5 m/d. Simulations with a discrete fracture/porous matrix flow and transport model, which used the cubic law for flow in fractures, showed that diffusion of the solutes, but not the much larger colloids, into the matrix pore water between fractures is sufficient to cause the observed difference in solute and colloid transport rates. Transport-derived and hydraulic conductivity-derived fracture aperture values were similar, within a factor of 3 and falling mainly within a range of 5-40 mum. In the upper 3 m the solute tracers were evenly distributed between pore water in the fractures and the matrix, and as a result, solute transport can be closely approximated with an equivalent porous medium (EPM) approach. Below this depth, fractures are more widely spaced (0.13 to > 1 m) with concentration peaks tending to occur near visible fractures, and solute transport cannot be adequately described with an EPM approach.

AB Located on the Senegal River in West Africa, the Manantali Dam has been given different rival objectives: energy production and low-flow augmentation on the one hand; flood support on the other. This study examines a large range of management strategies and quantifies the results for each objective, depending on the available water resources. The operational management of the dam is numerically simulated over the 1970-2000 period. The low flow augmentation is considered to satisfy the needs of irrigated agriculture (supposed equal, doubled or tripled compared with the actual needs) with a high guaranty. The flood support is considered for different objectives of traditional flood-plain farming areas (translated into flow hydrographs) and for different thresholds conditioning water release. The results obtained for 216 simulated management scenarios show a notable linear relationship between the mean annual energy production and the mean annual area of traditional cropping. In comparison with a base scenario with no flood support, the increase of I ha of mean traditional cultivation area resulting from flood support involves a loss of mean electricity production, which amounts to 614 W in the present situation and would increase to 789 W if the irrigation needs trebled. The high capacity of the Manantali Reservoir makes it possible to reach the following objectives: meeting the present irrigation needs; annual flood support allowing to 52 000 ha of mean flood-plain cultivation area (and a minimum of 45 000 ha); mean annual energy production of 768 GWh (and a minimum of 372 GWh).

ID EQUATION
AB A quasi three-dimensional (QUASI 3-D) model is presented for simulating the subsurface water flow and solute transport in the unsaturated and in the saturated zones of soil. The model is based on the assumptions of vertical how in the unsaturated zone and essentially horizontal groundwater flow. The 1-D Richards equation for the unsaturated zone is coupled at the phreatic surface with the 2-D flow equation for the saturated zone. The latter was obtained by averaging 3-D flow equation in the saturated zone over the aquifer thickness. Unlike the Boussinesq equation for a leaky-phreatic aquifer, the developed model does not contain a storage term with specific yield and a source term for natural replenishment. Instead it includes a water flux term at the phreatic surface through which the Richards equation is linked with the groundwater flow equation. The vertical water flux in the saturated zone is evaluated on the basis of the fluid mass balance equation while the horizontal fluxes, in that equation, are prescribed by Darcy law. A 3-D transport equation is used to simulate the solute migration. A numerical algorithm to solve the problem for the general quasi 3-D case was developed. The developed methodology was exemplified for the quasi 2-D cross-sectional case (QUASI2D). Simulations for three synthetic problems demonstrate good agreement between the results obtained by QUASI2D and two fully 2-D flow and transport codes (SUTRA and 2DSOIL).Yet, simulations with the QUASI2D code were several times faster than those by the SUTRA and the 2DSOIL codes.

AB This paper explores the relationship between channel network configurations and hydrograph sensitivity to storm kinematics with different storm speeds, storm directions, and storm sizes. A synthetic circular catchment is introduced, in order to prevent bias due to interaction between storm directions and catchment geometry. The drainage network of the test catchment is simulated with Gibbs' model for a given network configuration (). The peak response of the catchment is investigated with different configurations of drainage network, combined with different conditions of storm kinematics. The results show that the relationship between storm kinematics and the peak discharge response is dependent on the network configuration. The network configuration indicates the network efficiency in terms of the total drainage time of a network. The resonance condition can be defined for a 2-D drainage network as the inverse of the averaged total sum of flow distance. The results show that the storm kinematics that produces the maximum peak discharge depends on the network configuration because the resonance condition changes with the network configuration. The investigation of 12 catchments in the Chicago area indicates that urban drainage networks, typically, are highly efficient but can also be inefficient. The results illustrate that more inefficient networks (networks with lower ) are less sensitive to rainstorm movement and produce lower peak discharge, compared with efficient networks. In contrast, an efficient network produces higher peak discharges and is more sensitive to storm kinematics, compared with an inefficient network.

AB A p-order multivariate kernel density model based on kernel density theory has been developed for synthetic generation of multivariate variables. It belongs to a kind of data-driven approach and is able to avoid prior assumptions as to the form of probability distribution (normal or Pearson III) and the form of dependence (linear or non-linear). The p-order multivariate kernel density model is a non-parametric method for synthesis of streamflow. The model is more flexible than conventional parametric models used in stochastic hydrology. The effectiveness and satisfactoriness of this model are illustrated through its application to the simultaneous synthetic generation of daily streamflow from Pingshan station and Yibin-Pingshan region (Yi-Ping region) of the Jinsha River in China.

AB In this study, covariance functions of specific discharge for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows in a semiconfined aquifer were derived with mean flow parallel to the formation bedding. Spectral theory was used to analyze a unidirectional mean flow field of infinite extent which is perturbed by one- and two-dimensional statistically homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field. Relatively simple closed-form analytical expressions requiring only some numerical integration for two-dimensional flows were obtained for the longitudinal and transverse components of specific discharge covariance. The spatial, statistical structure of the specific discharge field was investigated in terms of the leakage factor and spatial structure of hydraulic conductivity field.

AB It is argued that the aggregation approach towards macroscale hydrological modelling, in which it is assumed that a model applicable at small scales can be applied at larger scales using 'effective' parameter values, is an inadequate approach to the scale problem. It is also unlikely that any general scaling theory can be developed due to the dependence of hydrological systems on historical and geological perturbations. Thus a disaggregation approach to developing scale-dependent models is advocated in which a representation of the distribution of hydrological responses is used to reflect hydrological heterogeneity. An appropriate form of distribution may vary with both scale and environment. Such an approach is dependent on the data available to define and calibrate the chosen subgrid parameterization. A parameterization based on a minimum patch representation is suggested and the problems of identification at the larger scale discussed.

AB This paper, the first of two, hypothesizes that: (1) the temporal variation of stream power of a river channel at a given station with varying discharge is accomplished by the temporal variation in channel form (flow depth and channel width) and hydraulic variables, including energy slope, flow velocity and friction; (2) the change in stream power is distributed among the changes in flow depth, channel width, flow velocity, slope, and friction, depending on the boundary conditions that the channels has to satisfy. The second hypothesis is a result of the principle of maximum entropy and the theory of minimum energy dissipation or its simplified minimum stream power. These two hypotheses lead to families of at-a-station hydraulic geometry relations. The conditions under which these families of relations can occur in the field are discussed.

AB Anisotropy and heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity (K) are suspected of greatly affecting rates and patterns of ground-water seepage in peats. A new laboratory method, termed here the modified cube method, was used to measure horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity (K(h) and K(v)) of 400 samples of bog peat. The new method avoids many of the problems associated with existing field and laboratory methods, and is shown to give relatively precise measurements of K. In the majority of samples tested, K(h) was much greater than K(v), indicating that the bog peat was strongly anisotropic. Log(10)K(h), log(10)K(v), and log(10) (K(h)/K(v)) were found to vary significantly with depth, although none of the relationships was simple. We comment on the scale dependency of our measurements.

ID SOLUTE TRANSPORT; STOCHASTIC-ANALYSIS; POROUS FORMATIONS;
   VELOCITY-FIELDS; GROUNDWATER; FLOW
AB Transport of an inert solute in a heterogeneous aquifer is governed by two mechanisms: advection by the random velocity field V(x) and pore-scale dispersion of coefficients D-dij. The velocity field is assumed to be stationary and of constant mean U and of correlation scale I much larger than the pore-scale d. It is assumed that D-dij = alpha(dij)U are constant. The relative effect of the two mechanisms is quantified by the Peclet numbers Pe(ij) = UI/D-dij = I/alpha(dij), which as a rule are much larger than unity. The main aim of the study is to determine the impact of finite, though high, Pe on [C] and sigma(C)(2), the concentration mean and variance, respectively. The solution, derived in the past, for Pe = infinity is reconsidered first. By assuming a normal X probability density function (p.d.f.), closed form solutions are obtained for [C] and sigma(C)(2). Recasting the problem in an Eulerian framework leads to the same results if certain closure conditions are adopted. The concentration moments for a finite Pe are derived subsequently in a Lagrangean framework. The pore-scale dispersion is viewed as a Brownian motion type of displacement X-d of solute subparticles, of scale smaller than d, added to the advective displacements X. By adopting again a normal p.d.f. for the latter, explicit expressions for [C] and sigma(C)(2) are obtained in terms of quadratures over the joint p.d.f. of advective two particles trajectories. While the influence of high Pe on [C] is generally small, it has a significant impact on sigma(C)(2). Simple results are obtained for a small V-0, for which trajectories are fully correlated. In particular, the concentration coefficient of variation at the center tends to a constant value for large time. Comparison of the present solution, obtained in terms of a quadrature, with the Monte Carlo simulations of Graham. and McLaughlin [1989] shows a very good agreement.

AB The scale dependence of nutrient loads exported from a catchment is a function of complex interactions between hydrologic and biogeochemical processes that modulate the input signals from the hillslope by aggregation and attenuation in a converging river network. Observational data support an empirical inverse relation between the biogeochemical cycling rate constant for nitrate k (T-1) and the stream stage h (L), k = v(f)/h, with v(f), the uptake velocity (LT-1), being constant in space under steady flow conditions. Here we offer a physical explanation for the persistence of this pattern across scales and then extend the analysis to spatiotemporal scaling of k under transient-flow conditions. Inverse k-h dependence arose as an emergent pattern by coupling the mechanistic Transient Storage Model with a network model. Analytical modeling indicated that (1) nitrate processing efficiency increases with increasing variability in the discharge Q and (2) temporal averaging had no effect on the exponent a of the k-h relationship (k = v(f)/h(a)) in catchments with low Q variability, but strong dependence arose in catchments with high variability in Q. Network modeling in domains with low Q variability confirmed that the exponent a was independent of temporal averaging, but v(f) was a function of the averaging timescale. The probability distribution functions for k could be adequately predicted using analytical approaches. Understanding the k-h scaling relationships enables the direct estimation of the variability in nutrient losses due to in-stream reactions without requiring explicit information for spatially distributed network modeling.

AB Micromodels have been increasingly employed in various ways in porous media research, to study the pore-scale behavior of fluids. Micromodels have proven to be a valuable tool by allowing the observation of flow and transport at the micron scale in chemical, biological, and physical applications. They have helped to improve our insight of flow and transport phenomena at both microscale and macroscale. Up to now, most micromodels that have been used to study the role of interfaces in two-phase flow were small, square, or nearly square domains. In this work, an elongated PDMS micromodel, bearing a flow network with dimensions 5x30 mm2 was manufactured. The pore network was designed such that the REV size was around 5x7 mm2. So, our flow network was considered to be nearly four times the REV size. Using such micromodels, we established that the inclusion of interfacial area between the wetting and the nonwetting fluids models the hysteretic relationship between capillary pressure and saturation in porous media. In this paper, we first present the procedure for manufacturing PDMS micromodels with the use of soft lithography. Then, we describe an innovative and novel optical setup that allows the real-time visualization of elongated samples. Finally, we present the results obtained by quasi-static, two-phase flow experiments.

DE DISTRIBUTED MODELING; HETEROGENEITIES; HYDROLOGICAL SYSTEMS
AB The state of the art of modelling hydrological systems using distributed modelling techniques is discussed and the theoretical problems caused by the heterogeneities always present in field soil systems are emphasized. It is argued that such heterogeneities need to be considered to develop physically based large-scale models applicable at the scale of the numerical discretization blocks. Stochastic approaches seem to provide a rational framework for treating the difficult to characterize spatial variability and for establishing a link between parameter uncertainty and prediction uncertainty. It is emphasized that more research in theory development and testing is required before complete large-scale models are obtained and this had to be carried out jointly with field tests. More research is also required in field measurement techniques to accurately supply the deterministic and statistical parameters required in distributed models.

TI The water balance of Lake Victoria
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

ID FLUCTUATIONS; RECORD; AFRICA
AB This paper presents new calculations of Lake Victoria's water balance. Evaporation is estimated using both the Penman formula and die energy balance approach, and sensitivity studies are performed to determine the influence of input data on the estimates. Rainfall over the lake is estimated from catchment rainfall using a relationship between the two that was derived using satellite data. The results, using the reference period 1956-1978, indicate that mean annual rainfall over the lake is 1791 mm, compared to mean annual evaporation of 1551 mm. When compared with lake level changes, tributary inflow, and discharge during this period, there is a resultant imbalance of 19 mm. Adding this amount to the calculated evaporation, we are able to reproduce with great accuracy the lake level changes during the period 1956-1978 utilizing precipitation estimates of this study plus measured inflow and discharge. Sensitivity studies show that the discrepancy in the balance of 19 mm is considerably smaller than the error in evaporation calculations that can be introduced by uncertainties in the input data. Of particular concern is cloudiness. The diurnal cycle of cloudiness is quite different over the lake than at shoreline stations and the total cloud cover over the lake is probably lower than at these stations. A change from 50% cloudiness to 30% can increase evaporation by about 30%. Thus, this study underscores the need for adequate cloud data, sufficient to resolve the diurnal cycle, as well as direct estimates of lake rainfall in assessing the lake's water balance.

TI Temporal behavior of a solute cloud in a heterogeneous porous medium 2.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID NONERGODIC TRANSPORT; DISPERSION; AQUIFER; MOMENTS
AB We investigate the temporal behavior of transport coefficients in a stochastic model for transport of a solute through a spatially heterogeneous saturated aquifer. While the first of these two companion papers [Dentz et al., this issue] investigated a situation characterized by a point-like solute injection, we now focus on the case of spatially extended solute sources. The analysis of the finite time behavior of the transport coefficients makes it necessary to distinguish between two fundamentally different quantities characterizing the solute dispersion. We define an "effective" dispersion coefficient which is derived from the average over the centered second moments of the spatial concentration distributions in every realization and an "ensemble" dispersion coefficient which follows from the second moment of the ensemble-averaged concentration distribution While the two quantities are equivalent in the asymptotic limit of infinite times or infinitely extended sources, they are qualitatively and quantitatively different for the more realistic situation of finite times and finite source extent. We demonstrate that in this case the ensemble quantity, used more or less implicitly in most of the previous studies, overestimates the true dispersion of the plume. Using a second-order perturbation theory approach, we derive explicit solutions for the temporal behavior of the dispersion coefficients for various types of isotropic and anisotropic initial conditions. We identify the relevant timescales which separate regimes of different temporal behavior and apply our formulae to the Borden experiment data. We find a good agreement between theory and experiment if we compare the observed dispersion with the appropriate effective dispersion coefficient (including the leading effects of the local dispersion), whereas the ensemble dispersion coefficient commonly used in the literature to analyze these data overestimates the experimental results considerably.

AB The relationship between antecedent flow conditions and nitrate concentrations was explored at eight sites in the 2.9 million square kilometers (km(2)) Mississippi River basin, USA. Antecedent flow conditions were quantified as the ratio between the mean daily flow of the previous year and the mean daily flow from the period of record (Qratio), and the Qratio was statistically related to nitrate anomalies (the unexplained variability in nitrate concentration after filtering out season, long-term trend, and contemporaneous flow effects) at each site. Nitrate anomaly and Qratio were negatively related at three of the four major tributary sites and upstream in the Mississippi River, indicating that when mean daily streamflow during the previous year was lower than average, nitrate concentrations were higher than expected. The strength of these relationships increased when data were subdivided by contemporaneous flow conditions. Five of the eight sites had significant negative relationships (p <= 0.05) at high or moderately high contemporaneous flows, suggesting nitrate that accumulates in these basins during a drought is flushed during subsequent high flows. At half of the sites, when mean daily flow during the previous year was 50 percent lower than average, nitrate concentration can be from 9 to 27 percent higher than nitrate concentrations that follow a year with average mean daily flow. Conversely, nitrate concentration can be from 8 to 21 percent lower than expected when flow during the previous year was 50 percent higher than average. Previously documented for small, relatively homogenous basins, our results suggest that relationships between antecedent flows and nitrate concentrations are also observable at a regional scale. Relationships were not observed (using all contemporaneous flow data to-gether) for basins larger than 1 million km2, suggesting that above this limit the overall size and diversity within these basins may necessitate the use of more complicated statistical approaches or that there may be no discernible basin-wide relationship with antecedent flow. The relationships between nitrate concentration and Qratio identified in this study serve as the basis for future studies that can better define specific hydrologic processes occurring during and after a drought (or high flow period) which influence nitrate concentration, such as the duration or magnitude of low flows, and the timing of low and high flows.

AB Velocity measurements, previously carried out using both a miniature current flowmeter and an acoustic Doppler velocimeter, are used to verify the applicability of the incomplete self-similarity theory to deduce the velocity profile in a gravel bed channel. Then, for the velocity profiles having the maximum value below the free surface and for the S-shaped profiles, the power velocity distribution is corrected using a new divergence function. For each value of the depth sediment ratio the nondimensional friction factor parameter is calculated by integration of the measured velocity distributions in the different verticals of the cross section. Finally, a semilogarithmic flow resistance equation is empirically deduced.

AB Particle filters (PFs) have become popular for assimilation of a wide range of hydrologic variables in recent years. With this increased use, it has become necessary to increase the applicability of this technique for use in complex hydrologic/land surface models and to make these methods more viable for operational probabilistic prediction. To make the PF a more suitable option in these scenarios, it is necessary to improve the reliability of these techniques. Improved reliability in the PF is achieved in this work through an improved parameter search, with the use of variable variance multipliers and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Application of these methods to the PF allows for greater search of the posterior distribution, leading to more complete characterization of the posterior distribution and reducing risk of sample impoverishment. This leads to a PF that is more efficient and provides more reliable predictions. This study introduces the theory behind the proposed algorithm, with application on a hydrologic model. Results from both real and synthetic studies suggest that the proposed filter significantly increases the effectiveness of the PF, with marginal increase in the computational demand for hydrologic prediction.

DT Article
AB A survey is presented of work done using variational inequalities in solving free-boundary problems arising in the filtration of liquids through porous materials. In 1971 Baiocchi proposed this new method for solving such problems. This method proved effective not only from the purely theoretical point of view, that is, for proving the existence and uniqueness of a solution, but also from the point of view of yielding new, simple and efficient numerical solution schemes. This new method was systematically and extensively developed by mathematicians at the Laboratory of Nurnerical Analysis at the National Research Centre in collaboration with the Institute of Hydraulics of the University of Pavia. The aim of this survey is to present the basic ideas of this method, its applications, and other problems to which various researchers have extended the method. Also, the paper is written in such a manner as to be understood by a more general audience other than mathematicians, who are the ones who have done the majority of work in this area.

AB [1] A set of water level time series collected along a transect through a sedimentary island aquifer was used to test the utility of various simple models of ocean tidal propagation in bounded one-dimensional aquifers. Fourier spectra were calculated for the ocean tidal modes and compared with spectra measured in wells along the island transect. Other sources of fluctuation could be neglected. An observed spatial bias in the well responses ( attenuations and lags) could not be modeled by a homogeneous aquifer theory. A theory involving composite heterogeneity accounted well for the spatial bias, yielding estimates of aquifer transmissivities and storage coefficients indicating a fivefold difference in hydraulic diffusivity along the transect. A lack of well locations toward one end of the transect reduced the statistical significance of this result, with correlations between regression parameters evident. At the same time, a second bias was seen involving the ratio of signal amplitude and lag with penetration distance into the aquifer, as observed in prior tidal studies. A brief set of numerical experiments showed that horizontal layering in aquifer properties was the most probable cause of this propagation bias. Application of these results to the island data set supported a conceptual stratigraphic model of a highly conductive, sloping stratum underlying a less conductive, superficial sand layer. This model is inconsistent with well logs along the island transect but is supported by additional off-transect well logs. It was concluded that one-dimensional tidal propagation models may be useful in inverse characterization of aquifers with macroscale hydrogeological structures, and that the analysis of measured propagation bias has the potential to yield extra information on aquifer properties in the vertical direction.

TI Towards hybrid modeling of the global hydrological cycle

ID WATER STORAGE; DATA ASSIMILATION; SURFACE-WATER; VARIABILITY;
   SEASONALITY; VEGETATION; ENSEMBLE; SYSTEM
AB State-of-the-art global hydrological models (GHMs) exhibit large uncertainties in hydrological simulations due to the complexity, diversity, and heterogeneity of the land surface and subsurface processes, as well as the scale dependency of these processes and associated parameters. Recent progress in machine learning, fueled by relevant Earth observation data streams, may help overcome these challenges. But machine learning methods are not bound by physical laws, and their interpretability is limited by design.
   In this study, we exemplify a hybrid approach to global hydrological modeling that exploits the data adaptivity of neural networks for representing uncertain processes within a model structure based on physical principles (e.g., mass conservation) that form the basis of GHMs. This combination of machine learning and physical knowledge can potentially lead to data-driven, yet physically consistent and partially interpretable hybrid models.
   The hybrid hydrological model (H2M), extended from Kraft et al. (2020), simulates the dynamics of snow, soil moisture, and groundwater storage globally at 1 degrees spatial resolution and daily time step. Water fluxes are simulated by an embedded recurrent neural network. We trained the model simultaneously against observational products of terrestrial water storage variations (TWS), grid cell runoff (Q), evapo-transpiration (ET), and snow water equivalent (SWE) with a multi-task learning approach.
   We find that the H2M is capable of reproducing key patterns of global water cycle components, with model performances being at least on par with four state-of-the-art GHMs which provide a necessary benchmark for H2M. The neuralnetwork-learned hydrological responses of evapotranspiration and grid cell runoff to antecedent soil moisture states are qualitatively consistent with our understanding and theory. The simulated contributions of groundwater, soil moisture, and snowpack variability to TWS variations are plausible and within the ranges of traditional GHMs. H2M identifies a somewhat stronger role of soil moisture for TWS variations in transitional and tropical regions compared to GHMs.
   With the findings and analysis, we conclude that H2M provides a new data-driven perspective on modeling the global hydrological cycle and physical responses with machine-learned parameters that is consistent with and complementary to existing global modeling frameworks. The hybrid modeling approaches have a large potential to better leverage ever-increasing Earth observation data streams to advance our understandings of the Earth system and capabilities to monitor and model it.

AB Runoff generation can be modelled using a topographic wetness index; the fraction of the catchment where the wetness index exceeds some threshold is assumed to be saturated. We show that distributions of a topographic index can share a common form across many catchments, particularly for sufficiently large catchments. This leads us to speculate that the topographic structure of drainage networks provides a unifying theme for runoff generation. We identify those catchments which share the common distribution of topographic index, and label them ''organized.'' Visual examination of maps of this index and of subcatchment area indicates that the organized catchments are those which have a ''proper'' network: The branching structure provides an orderly increase in subcatchment area as one proceeds downstream. We consider that the presence of a ''properly'' branched network is the essence of ''organization.'' It has previously been observed that catchments can have a power law distribution of subcatchment area: our data show that the distributions of wetness index and subcatchment area are closely connected for catchments with a well-developed channel network. Since the distribution of subcatchment area is a signature of the channel network, this permits the reparameterization of runoff generation models using channel network properties. As a result, the runoff generation model is a truly a catchment-scale model and can no longer be disaggregated to the point scale. This view of catchment response is closely related to the representative elementary area concept, where catchment response is ''simple'' for sufficiently large catchments and depends only on catchment-scale phenomena.

AB A typical feature of the land surface is its heterogeneity in terms of the spatial variability of land surface characteristics and parameters controlling physical/hydrological, biological, and other related processes. Different forms and degrees of heterogeneity need to be taken into account in hydrological modelling. The first part of the article concerns the conditions under which a disaggregation of the land surface into subareas of uniform or ''quasihomogeneous'' behaviour (hydrotopes or hydrological response units - HRUs) is indispensable. In a case study in northern Germany, it is shown that forests in contrast to arable land, areas with shallow groundwater in contrast to those with deep, water surfaces and sealed areas should generally be distinguished (disaggregated) in modelling, whereas internal heterogeneities within these hydrotopes can be assessed statistically, e.g., by areal distribution functions (soil water holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity, etc.). Models with hydrotope-specific parameters can be applied to calculate the "vertical" processes (fluxes, storages, etc.), and this, moreover, for hydrotopes of different area, and even for groups of distributed hydrotopes in a reference area (hydrotope classes), provided that the meteorological conditions are similar. Thus, a scaling problem does not really exist in this process domain. The primary domain for the application of scaling laws is that of lateral flows in landscapes and river basins. This is illustrated in the second part of the article, where results of a case study in Bavaria/Germany are presented and discussed. It is shown that scaling laws can be applied efficiently for the determination of the Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH) of the surface runoff system in river basins: simple scaling for basins larger than 43 km(2), and multiple scaling for smaller basins. Surprisingly, only two parameters were identified as important in the derived relations: the drainage area and, in some cases, the elevation a.s.l.. The scaling exponent was determined as equal or approximately equal to the exponent 0.566 in Hack's law. Therefore, it is suggested that there is some relation between the scaling laws and the fractal nature of river networks, and accordingly with the complex dynamics of the interacting hydrological and geomorphological processes in river basins.

AB Winter precipitation variability over the Iberian peninsula was investigated by obtaining the spatial and temporal patterns. Empirical Orthogonal Functions were used to describe the variance distribution and to compress the precipitation data into a few modes. The corresponding spatial patterns divide the peninsula into climatic regions according to precipitation variations. The associated time series were related to large scale circulation indices and tropical sea surface temperature anomalies by using lag cross-correlation and cross-spectrum. The major findings are: the most influential indices for winter precipitation were the North Atlantic Oscillation and the East Atlantic/West Russian pattern. coherent oscillations were detected at about eight years between precipitation and the North Atlantic Oscillation and some dynamic consequences of the circulation on precipitation over the Iberian peninsula were examined during drought and wet spells. In the end statistical methods have been proposed to downscale seasonal precipitation prediction.

AB only in a few places and cannot be reasonably transferred to other places or to far distant time periods. Transfer in space is difficult because the models are conditioned on past observations at particular places to define parameter values and un-observable processes that are needed to fully characterize the structure and functioning of the landscape. Transfer in time has to deal with the likely temporal changes to both parameters and processes under future changed conditions. This remains an important obstacle to addressing some of the most urgent prediction questions in hydrology, such as prediction in ungauged basins and prediction under global change. In this paper, we propose a new approach to catchment hydrological modeling, based on universal principles that do not change in time and that remain valid across many places. The key to this framework, which we call behavioral modeling, is to assume that there are universal and time-invariant organizing principle:; that can be used to identify the most appropriate model structure (including parameter values) and responses for a given ecosystem at a given moment in time. These organizing principles may be derived from fundamental physical or biological laws, or from empirical laws that have been demonstrated to be time-invariant and to hold at many places and scales. Much fundamental research remains to be undertaken to help discover these organizing principles on the basis of exploration of observed patterns of landscape structure and hydrological behavior and their interpretation as legacy effects of past co-evolution of climate, soils, topography, vegetation and humans. Our hope is that the new behavioral modeling framework will be a step forward towards a new vision for hydrology where models are capable of more confidently predicting the behavior of catchments beyond what has been observed or experienced before.

AB The effect of strong heterogeneity on the onset of convection induced by a vertical density gradient in a saturated heterogeneous porous medium governed by Darcy's law is investigated. A computer package has been developed to study the applicability of an average Rayleigh number as a criterion for the onset of convection in strongly heterogeneous geologic media. The heterogeneous geologic media have been described using random spatial functions for the permeability field which are lognormally distributed and spatially correlated. Both isotropic and anisotropic correlation lengths within the geologic structure are considered. This paper presents the first 3D theoretical treatment of the conditions for the onset of convection (Rayleigh stability criteria) in strongly heterogeneous porous media. We elucidate the critical role that spatial dimensionality (2D versus 3D flow) plays in controlling convection processes and stability criteria. Our results quantitatively demonstrate for the first time that spatial dimensionality is a dominant control on the onset of convection in a strongly heterogeneous geologic medium. Unbounded Rayleigh number behavior is observed in 3D. This leads to the important new conclusion that a Rayleigh number (based on mean quantities) is unlikely to be a valid predictor for the onset of convection in 3D strongly heterogeneous porous media. Furthermore, we systematically and quantitatively demonstrate that the onset of convection in a heterogeneous geologic medium is highly sensitive to changes in the standard deviation of the lognormal permeability field, moderately sensitive to changes in the level of correlation length, and relatively insensitive to the anisotropy of correlation length.

AB We present a predictive, multiscale modeling framework for chemotaxis in porous media. This model results from volume averaging the governing equations for bacterial transport at the microscale and is expressed in terms of effective medium coefficients that are predicted from the solution of the associated closure problems. As a result, the averaged chemotactic velocity is an explicit function of the attractant concentration field and diffusivity, rather than an empirical effective chemotactic sensitivity coefficient. The model was validated by comparing the transverse bacterial concentration profiles with experimental measurements for Escherichia coli HCB1 in a T-sensor. The averaged chemotactic velocity predicted by the model was found to be within the range of values reported in the literature. Reasonable agreement (approximately 10% mean absolute error) between theory and experiments was found for several flow rates. In order to assess the potential for decreasing the computational demands of the model, the macroscale domain was divided into subdomains for the coupling of bacterial transport to that of the attractant. Sensitivity analysis was performed regarding the number of subdomains chosen, and the results indicate that bacterial transport (as measured by concentration profiles) was not highly affected by this choice. Overall, these results suggest that the predictive, multiscale modeling framework is reliable for modeling chemotaxis in porous media when chemotactic transport is significant compared to convective transport.

ID REFLECTIVITY; INTEGRALS
AB The present study develops a method called window correlation matching method (WCMM) to reduce collocation and timing errors in matching pairs of radar measured reflectivity, Z(e), and gauge measured rainfall intensity, R, for improving the accuracy of the estimation of Z(e)-R relationships. This method was compared with the traditional matching method (TMM), the probability matching method (PMM) and the window probability matching method (WPMM). The calibrated relationship Z(e) = 18.05 R-1.45 obtained from 7 x 7 km of space window and both present and 5 min previous time of radar observation for time window (S77T5) produces the best results for radar rainfall estimates for orographic rain over the Mae Chaem Water-shed in the north of Thailand. The comparison shows that the Z(e)-R relationship obtained from WCMM provide more accuracy in radar rainfall estimates as compared with the other three methods. The Z(e)-R relationships estimated using TMM and PMM provide large overestimation and underestimation, respectively, of mean areal rainfall whereas WPMM slightly underestimated the mean areal rainfall. Based on the overall results, it can be concluded that WCMM can reduce collocation and timing errors in Z(e)-R pairs matching and improve the estimation of Z(e)-R relationships for radar rainfall. WCMM is therefore a promising method for improved radar-measured rainfall, which is an important input for hydrological and environmental modeling and water resources management.

ID LONGITUDINAL PROFILES; ALLUVIAL CHANNELS; AGGRADATION
AB We propose and test a theory describing the onset and growth of tributary-dammed lakes. Using a diffusion equation constrained by backwater effects, we show how tributary sediment influx can cause either a cuspate river aggradation or the formation of a lake upstream of the tributary junction. This lake expands up valley and drowns previous deposits to leave a downstream-facing lake bed of inclination milder than the angle of stability. We obtain exact similarity solutions for such river and lake bed profiles and validate them quantitatively using laboratory experiments. The resulting profiles are in qualitative accord with those of natural tributary-dammed rivers.

AB The problems and present methods for the calculation of monthly and annual effective infiltration coefficients in Dinaric karat catchments which cover areas smaller than 200 km(2) are discussed. An example is given of the catchment of the Gradole karat spring, which covers 114 km(2) The climate on the catchment is North Mediterranean, with average annual rainfall of 986 mm, average air temperature of 11.4 degreesC, and average discharge from the Gradole Spring of 1.98 m(3) s(-1). All the data refer to a period from 1987 to 1998. An auto-correlation analysis is carried out of daily and monthly discharges from the spring and monthly rainfall on the catchment. Special attention has been given to determination of monthly effective infiltration coefficients. It was found that the time-scale effect makes it infeasible to use the equation for effective infiltration coefficient, because it gives values greater than 1 in 25% of cases, which is theoretically impossible. Therefore, two different procedures for calculation of monthly effective infiltration coefficients are given, out of which one uses the master depletion curve. This procedure gives acceptable and physically well-established values of mean long-term monthly effective infiltration coefficients. Obtained values can be used for regional analyses as well as for water resources management in karat regions. There was also a strong relationship between mean monthly air temperatures of the catchment and mean monthly effective infiltration coefficients. It is found that rainfall distribution during the year significantly influences the annual effective infiltration coefficients, which for the Gradole catchment ranges between 0.356 and 0.763 with the mean value of 0.57.

AB The microflow environments of aquatic plants with reference to Myriophylluin and Hydrilla are simulated in a laboratory flume. A Nix Streamflow microflow meter was used to measure the mean velocity profiles of flow at different densities of plants, flow ranges and measurement positions. Each mean velocity profile consists of three hydrodynamic regimes (i.e. within-canopy zone, above-canopy zone and a transitional zone between them), which indicate the presence of two benthic boundary layers (internal and external ones). Out of 38 measured mean velocity profiles, most do not fit a logarithmic relationship. The following hydrodynamic parameters are used in characterizing the flow regimes: local shear velocity (u(*)), roughness length (z(o)), canopy roughness Reynolds number (Re-*), bed shear stress (tau(o)) and laminar sublayer (sigma).

TI Calibrating 1D hydrodynamic river models in the absence of cross-section

AB Hydrodynamic modeling has been increasingly used to simulate water surface elevation which is important for flood prediction and risk assessment. Scarcity and inaccessibility of in situ bathymetric information have hindered hydrodynamic model development at continental-to-global scales. Therefore, river cross-section geometry is commonly approximated by highly simplified generic shapes. Hydrodynamic river models require both bed geometry and roughness as input parameters. Simultaneous calibration of shape parameters and roughness is difficult, because often there are trade-offs between them. Instead of parameterizing cross-section geometry and hydraulic roughness separately, this study introduces a parameterization of 1D hydrodynamic models by combining cross-section geometry and roughness into one conveyance parameter. Flow area and conveyance are expressed as power laws of flow depth, and they are found to be linearly related in log-log space at reach scale. Data from a wide range of river systems show that the linearity approximation is globally applicable. Because the two are expressed as power laws of flow depth, no further assumptions about channel geometry are needed. Therefore, the hydraulic inversion approach allows for calibrating flow area and conveyance curves in the absence of direct observations of bathymetry and hydraulic roughness. The feasibility and performance of the hydraulic inversion workflow are illustrated using satellite observations of river width and water surface elevation in the Songhua river, China. Results show that this approach is able to reproduce water level dynamics with root-mean-square error values of 0.44 and 0.50 m at two gauging stations, which is comparable to that achieved using a standard calibration approach. In summary, this study puts forward an alternative method to parameterize and calibrate river models using satellite observations of river width and water surface elevation.

AB Simplifications to the depth-integrated soil water transport equation lead to an Ito stochastic differential equation where the evaporation is related to the stored water by the nonlinear soil water diffusivity function. From the derived equation the diffusivity function was estimated from daily stored water measurements obtained at the field scale using nonlinear filtering theory for a period of 100 days. Comparisons with daily evaporation measured with a sensitive 50-ton lysimeter indicated that the proposed method may be used to determine soil water diffusivity functions at the field scale under natural conditions when applied water and evaporation are the primary controlling physical mechanisms in the hydrologic budget.

   SUSPENDED-SOLIDS IN STREAMS
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
DE TURBIDITY; SUSPENDED SOLIDS; DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER; PARTICLE SIZE;
   MONITORING
AB Investigating the transport of suspended solids by water sampling usually leads to an underestimation of loads and an unrealistically high sampling frequency is required to properly characterize temporal trends. An alternative method is to use in situ optical turbidimeters to estimate the suspended solids concentration; however, the relationship between turbidity and suspended solids concentration is potentially confounded by variations in particle size, particle composition and water colour. Field measurements, and laboratory measurements using the type of natural material suspended in streamwater, were made to quantify the influences of these factors on nephelometric turbidity (Hach 2100A) and attenuance turbidity (Partech 7000 3RP MKII). The attenuance turbidity was approximately 2.5 times higher than nephelometric turbidity. The turbidity instruments were most sensitive to dispersions with a median diameter of 1.2-1.4 mu m. Particle size variation can cause the turbidity to vary by a factor of four for the same concentration of suspended solids. However, the numerous close correlations between turbidity and suspended solids concentration reported previously suggests that either the particle size variations are not usually great, or that particle size variations are often associated with variations in suspended solids concentration. For the same concentration and particle size, organic particles gave attenuance turbidity values two to three times higher than mineral particles. However, shortterm temporal variations from purely organic to purely mineral particle loads are rare in nature, so variations in the percentage of organic matter in the particulate load will not confound turbidity to this extent. Coloured dissolved organic matter is unlikely to alter the turbidity reading by more than 10%. An adequate relationship between turbidity measured in the field and suspended solids concentration should be expected in most situations. Some variance can be tolerated because a continuous estimate of suspended solids concentration overcomes the problem of infrequent sampling, which is the greatest source of error in the estimation of stream sediment loads.

AB The estimation of catchment-averaged aquifer hydraulic conductivity values is usually performed through a base flow recession analysis. Relationships between the first time derivatives of the base flow and the base flow values themselves, derived for small and large values of time, are used for this purpose. However, in the derivation of the short-time equations, an initially fully saturated aquifer without recharge with sudden drawdown is assumed, which occurs very rarely in reality. It is demonstrated that this approach leads to a nonnegligible error in the parameter estimates. A new relationship is derived, valid for the rising limb of a base flow hydrograph, succeeding a long rainless period. Application of this equation leads to accurate estimates of the aquifer lower layer saturated hydraulic conductivity. Further, it has been shown analytically that, if base flow is modeled using the linearized Boussinesq equation, the base flow depends on the effective aquifer depth and the ratio of the saturated hydraulic conductivity to the drainable porosity, not on these three parameters separately. The results of the new short-time expression are consistent with this finding, as opposed to the use of a traditional base flow recession analysis. When base flow is modeled using the nonlinear Boussinesq equation, the new expression can be used, without a second equation for large values of time, to estimate the aquifer lower layer hydraulic conductivity. Overall, the results in this paper suggest that the new methodology outperforms a traditional recession analysis for the estimation of catchment-averaged aquifer hydraulic conductivities.

AB Previous studies have examined free convection and the development of fingers in variable-density groundwater environments, but the penetration rates of fingering processes (i.e., fingering speeds) have not been systematically investigated. Unlike common groundwater processes driven by advection and whose flow rates may be computed using Darcy's law, fingering speeds are far less intuitive. In this study, fingering speeds are analyzed in a natural convection system using two measurable diagnostics: deepest plume front (DPF, providing upper bounds on plume speeds) and vertical center of solute mass (COM, providing global speeds). The permeability, porosity, and dispersion (longitudinal and transverse dispersivities) were varied using a perturbation-based stochastic approach to investigate their effects on fingering speeds. Modeling results show that the characteristic convective velocity, commonly used to represent theoretical fingering speeds, needs to incorporate effective porosity in a similar fashion to hydraulically driven average linear velocity and needs to be further adjusted by multiplying by a corrective factor f for predicting various fingering behaviors (approximately f = 0.115 for DPF and f = 0.034 for COM) in this study. A stochastic analysis demonstrates small variability in the time-varying speed of both DPF and COM between model realizations. This indicates that reproducing fingering speeds is likely to be achieved and that one single realization can adequately produce f for the characteristic convective velocity. This study also identifies that f for speeds of DPF is most likely to be constrained by (0.115, 1.000), which is extremely useful in the design of laboratory and field experimentation.

AB The instantaneous salt dilution method for water discharge measurements in open channels has been improved by the development of a new instrument measuring conductivity. The salt method consists of two parts: the calibration and the actual measurement in the stream. The calibration aims to calculate the linear relationship between electrical conductivity and salt concentration at various degrees of dilution in a salt solution. The original undiluted solution is injected into the water of a stream and the conductivity is measured downstream from the injection site. When measuring, the new instrument integrates the conductivity over time. From the value obtained on the instrument's display, the water discharge can easily be calculated on a hand-PC in the field. The instrument has eliminated the subsequent calculation work formerly necessary. It has increased the accuracy of the method and also reduced the need for field personnel during measurements.

AB We investigate if a mean equivalent flow model can be defined to describe hydraulic head variations in a crystalline aquifer characterized by multiscale heterogeneity. We analyzed in particular the hydraulic response of a crystalline aquifer to pumping tests covering a large range of spatial and temporal scales. Pumping tests appear to be well designed to test the medium hydraulic properties and to track scaling effects, since the perturbation induced by pumping grows with time and samples increasingly large volumes. We tested well-test interpretation frameworks underpinned by equivalent media models that basically contain scaling information. Interpretations of drawdown time series, recorded in piezometers located at distances ranging from 2 to 400 m from the pumping well and of durations ranging from 5 to 90 days, show that the temporal evolutions of drawdown are well modeled by fractional flow models [Barker, 1988; Acuna and Yortsos, 1995]. Estimates of flow dimensions are consistent across the whole site and lie in the range [1.4-1.7]. To investigate the nature of diffusion, we defined a methodology based on the evolution of the characteristic time or amplitude of hydraulic head variations with the distance from the pumping well. For most of the piezometers, those aligned along the main fault, it is possible to define a scaling law for all piezometers with a unique set of parameters. The derived exponents imply that hydraulic head diffusion is anomalously slow, a characteristic that is taken into account only in the model of Acuna and Yortsos [1995], based on diffusion in fractals.

ID MOBILE BED; RIVER
AB A set of experiments is described that obtain the shape of stable, straight, uniform, mobile-bed channels with cohesionless banks. These experiments were carried out in an outdoor flume at length scales at least twice those used by previous experimenters, but otherwise using similar techniques, including the use of a half channel against the flume wall in order to suppress meandering. Eight flume runs are reported, including channels farther from threshold conditions than those previously tested. The resulting data might prove useful both in validating theories for the stable shape of the straight channel and for advancing models of the adjustment to that shape.

AB The paper addresses the problem of transport of inert solutes in random nonstationary velocity fields. General equations for the first two moments of the particle trajectory are derived. It is shown that they can be solved analytically in quadratures for the case of quasi-unidirectional mean flows. The solution generalizes the previous results obtained for transport in velocity fields which are uniform in the average. The theory is applied to the case of transport in media displaying a linear trend in the mean logconductivity. The dynamics of particle displacements is discussed for the case of two-dimensional media with isotropic fluctuations of the logconductivity.

AB A quasi-dynamic wetness index that accounts for variable drainage times since a prior rainfall event is derived from simple subsurface flow theory.  The method is tested through a series of field observations and numerical experiments using a spatially distributed, dynamic hydrologic model.  The quasi-dynamic wetness index is shown to be a useful extension of previously developed static indices for predicting the location of zones of soil saturation and the distribution of soil water (i.e., the soil water content overlying a shallow impermeable or semiimpermeable layer).  The new index is not constrained by the steady state assumption that forms the basis of existing indices.

DE STREAM NETWORK MORPHOLOGY; HUMID CATCHMENTS; STORM RESPONSE;
   HYDROLOGICAL SIMILARITY
AB Addressing scaling issues in hydrological modelling involves, among other things, the study of problems related to hydrological similarity between catchments of different scales. Recent research about catchment similarity relationships is based on distributed conceptual models of surface runoff production. In this type of hydrological modelling both infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff production mechanisms are considered. In many humid lowland areas overland flow is a rare phenomenon because of the specific conditions that prevail: moderate rainfall, high infiltration capacity and low relief. The complete drainage system in these regions consists of surface and subsurface components which have organized themselves in a given geological, geomorphological and climatic situation. A surface drainage network has developed through sapping erosion at the zone of groundwater exfiltration. The resulting hierarchical stream network is in equilibrium with large time-scale conditions and adjusts itself dynamically to the inter-year and seasonal meteorological fluctuations. Greater understanding of the interrelationships that underlie the storm response of catchments in humid lowland regions can be expected by focusing on stream network morphology as a function of topography, geology and climate. This paper applies the physically based mathematical model of stream network morphology, developed by De Vries (1977), to the Zwalmbeek catchment, Belgium. Based on this model and for different climatic conditions (expressed in terms of rainfall characteristics) the first-order stream spacing versus average water-table depth relationship is calculated. From field observations, digital elevation model derived channel network drainage densities and flood event analysis it is concluded that the 1% exceedance probability rainfall can be suggested as representative for the shaping climatic conditions in the catchment under study, The corresponding curves relating channel network characteristics, such as stream spacing, drainage density and channel geometry, to average water-table depth are basin descriptors and could be used for comparative studies (e.g. regional flood frequency analysis). The model further allows for the prediction of the expansion and shrinkage of the first-order channel network as a function of catchment wetness expressed in terms of the effective water-table depth.

TI THE EFFECT OF QUADRATIC GRADIENT TERMS ON THE BOREHOLE SOLUTION IN
   POROELASTIC MEDIA
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID STABILITY; ROCK
AB When compressible fluid continuity in a fluid-saturated compressible porous medium under transient conditions is considered, we cannot obtain a standard linear diffusion equation in terms of pressure unless we ignore the quadratic terms in the pressure gradient expression, for example [partial-derivative-p/partial-derivative-r]2 for cylindrical plane strain coordinates.  They are assumed to be so small that their contribution can be ignored in pressure analysis.  Thereby, a nonlinear equation can be avoided.  During hydraulic fracturing, rapid drawdown, or slug testing, the pressure difference can reach a high value "instantly."  An extremely steep pressure gradient is generated, and it may not be appropriate to neglect quadratic terms.  In this paper, an analytical solution for pore pressure coupling with the deformation in a porous medium is developed by taking the quadratic term into account.  By Laplace transformation, we obtain a solution for a nonlinear diffusion equation by setting up a fluid continuity equation according to the mass conservation law rather than from energy principles in terms of volume.  Deviations from existing solutions are identified in cases of high pressure gradients, and these deviations are related to the compressibility of the pore and injected fluids.  It would seem that the new solution gives a more correct early time response in these cases.  To calculate the effective stresses and pore pressure, we need to carefully define hydraulic diffusivity.  We have related the coefficients of Biot and Geertsma to those of mass conservation, which are commonly used in hydrology.

AB A stochastic approach is adopted for characterizing the uncertainty in well capture zones in heterogeneous formations. Transmissivity is modeled as a random space function and a Monte Carlo approach is used to infer the probability distribution of the resulting stochastic capture zones. Through several numerical experiments, the influence of the statistical parameters of transmissivity variation on the extent of uncertainty in the location of the capture zone is investigated. Two aquifer models are considered: a fully confined aquifer and a leaky-confined aquifer receiving recharge from above. A connection is made with previous work on transport theory, and the statistical parameters of the capture zone probability distribution are compared with those of a solute concentration plume.

AB Solute transport in rivers is controlled by surface hydrodynamics and by mass exchanges with distinct retention zones. Surface and hyporheic retention processes can be accounted for separately in solute transport models with multiple storage compartments. In the simplest two component model, short term storage can be associated to in-channel transient retention, e.g. produced by riparian vegetation or surface dead zones, and the long-term storage can be associated to hyporheic exchange. The STIR (Solute Transport In Rivers) multiple domain transport model is applied here to tracer test data from three very different Mediterranean streams with distinctive characteristics in terms of flow discharge, vegetation and substrate material. The model is used with an exponential residence time distribution (RTD) to represent surface storage processes and two distinct modeling closures are tested to simulate hyporheic retention: a second exponential RTD and a power-law distribution approximating a known solution for bedform-induced hyporheic exchange. Each stream shows distinct retention patterns characterized by different timescales of the storage time distribution. Both modeling closures lead to very good approximations of the observed breakthrough curves in the two rivers with permeable bed exposed to the flow, where hyporheic flows are expected to occur. In the one case where the occurrence of hyporheic flows is inhibited by bottom vegetation, only the two exponential RTD model is acceptable and the time scales of the two components are of the same magnitude. The significant finding of this work is the recognition of a strong signature of the river properties on tracer data and the evidence of the ability of multiple-component models to describe individual stream responses. This evidence may open a new perspective in river contamination studies, where rivers could possibly be classified based on their ability to trap and release pollutants. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ONLINE
AB Rainfall-runoff models of the black box type abound in the water resources literature (i.e., transfer function, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), ARMAX, state space, etc.). The corresponding system identification algorithms for such models are known to be numerically efficient and accurate, leading in most cases to good parsimonious representations of the rainfall-runoff process. Alternatively, every model in transfer function, ARMA, and ARMAX form has an equivalent state space representation. However, state space models do not necessarily have simple system identification algorithms, unless the system matrices are restricted to some canonical form. Furthermore, state space system identification algorithms that work with the rainfall/runoff data directly (i.e., covariance free), require initial conditions and are inherently iterative and nonlinear. In this paper we present a state space system identification theory which overcomes these limitations. One advantage of such a theory is that the corresponding algorithms are highly robust to additive noise in the data. They are referred to as ''subspace algorithms'' due to their ability to separate the signal subspace from the noise subspace. The main advantages of the subspace algorithms are the automatic structure identification (system order), geometrical insights (notions of angle between subspaces), and the fact that they rely on robust numerical procedures (singular value decomposition). In this paper, two algorithms are presented. The first one is a two-step procedure, where the impulse response (unit hydrograph ordinates for the single-input, single-output case) are computed from the input/output data by solving a constrained deconvolution problem. These impulse response ordinates are then used as inputs for identifying the system matrices by means of a Hankel-based realization algorithm. The second approach uses the data directly to identify the system matrices, bypassing the deconvolution step. The algorithms are tested with real data from the Veer catchment in Belgium.

AB This work extends the simple experimental studies initiated by Heilig et al. [J. Hydrol. 244(2001) 9] to study erosion processes inherent to a mechanistic soil erosion model (the Rose model) that were not addressed in earlier studies. Specifically, we investigated the impacts of ponding water depth and soil detachability on erosion. The Rose model describes the interplay among the processes of soil detachment, transport, deposition, and redetachment, which are involved in rain-induced soil erosion and sediment transport. The simple experiment that was used to improve our understanding of how water-ponding and soil detachability affect soil erosion utilized a small, horizontal, uniform, soil surface exposed to uniform, simulated rainfall. Rainfall rates were systematically changed between 6 and 48 mm h(-1). Soil detachability was associated with a clay soil prepared at two different water contents. The Rose model was applied to the experimental conditions and the predicted erosion behavior was compared to experimental measurements. Observed data compared very well with the model results. The experimentally. observed relationship between ponding water depth and soil detachability agreed well with previously proposed theories; soil detachability was constant for ponding depths below a critical depth and dramatically decreased above the critical depth. Also, these experiments corroborated that the soil detachability as represented in the Rose model is independent of rain intensity. These results provide support to the validity of the Rose model with respect to the roles of surface water-ponding and its relationship to soil detachability. These mechanisms can be incorporated into models of more complicated and realistic systems in which these individual processes may be difficult to explicitly identify. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A laboratory flow cell was used to study chemical transport to wells producing water from two realizations of a heterogeneous porous medium. The wells produced water from a confined aquifer which was otherwise governed by a mean uniform hydraulic gradient. For both realizations the aquifer was composed of a two-dimensional, lognormally distributed, second-order stationary, exponentially correlated conductivity field. For the first realization, response was monitored at a single well 45 integral scales from the inflow boundary. Four wells were used in the second realization, with locations ranging from 10 to 45 integral scales from this boundary. The focus of this work was on the nature of the dispersion observed in the chemical arrival at the pumping well, and this work builds on an earlier study in which it was shown that results under mean uniform flow were relatively consistent with stochastic theories for fluid flow and chemical transport under mean uniform flow. Consistent results were obtained across the two realizations for the wells located 45 integral scales from the boundary as the breakthrough curves demonstrated an increase in dispersive behavior with an increase in the ratio of the pumping rate to the regional flow, consistent with existing theory for finite-sized sources. In contrast, results for the well located closest to the source (10 integral scales) demonstrated variability in the timing and shape of the breakthrough curves that did not correlate with the ratio of pumping at the well to regional flow. The results indicate that the shape and timing of a breakthrough curve at a well producing within a regional flow field may be strongly dependent on the distance of the well from the source. Further, the parameters (e.g., dispersivity) obtained from analysis of the breakthrough curve are shown to be functions of the ratio of pumping rate at the well to the regional flux.

TI Water insecurity in the Global North: A review of experiences in U.S.

AB Since the late 1970s, the term "colonias" (in English) has described low-income, peri-urban, and rural subdivisions north of the U.S.-Mexico border. These communities are in arid and semi-arid regions-now in a megadrought-and tend to have limited basic infrastructure, including community water service and sanitation. Recent scholarship has demonstrated how colonias residents experience unjust and inequitable dynamics that produce water insecurity in the Global North. In this review, we explain why U.S. colonias are an important example for theorizing water insecurity in the United States and beyond in the Global North. Tracing the history of water infrastructure development in U.S. colonias, we show how colonias are legally and socially defined by water insecurity. We draw on the published literature to discuss key factors that produce water insecurity in U.S. colonias: political exclusion, municipal underbounding, and failures in water quality monitoring. We show that water insecurity had led to negative outcomes-including poor water access, risks to physical health, and mental ill-health-in U.S. colonias. We present four possible approaches to improving water security in U.S. colonias: (1) soft paths & social infrastructure for water delivery, (2) decentralized water treatment approaches, such as point-of-use, point-of-entry, and fit-for-purpose systems; (3) informality, including infrastructural, economic, and socio-cultural innovations; and (4) political, policy, and law innovations and reforms. At the same time, we reflect seriously on how water security can be ethically achieved in partnership and aligning with the visions of U.S. colonias residents themselves.

AB To evaluate the relationship between the moisture conditions and the water repellency of soil surfaces in situ, we periodically conducted field surveys for more than a year in a humid-temperate forest in Japan. Measurements were made in four plots with varying soil physicochemical properties and under different topographic conditions across a hillslope. Each plot contained permanent quadrats with measurement points in a grid pattern. At each point, we measured the volumetric water content at 0- to 5-cm depths and the water repellency at soil surfaces approximately twice a month. The repeated measurements enabled us to estimate the critical water content (CWC) below which soils repelled water at each point. We defined the representative CWC (RCWC) of a plot as the median of all CWCs in a plot and estimated the representative critical water potential (RCWP) on the basis of the RCWC using the water retention curve. The RCWC values differed among plots, but the corresponding RCWP values were similar (pF?=?3.53.9). The relationship of the areal fraction showing water repellency against soil water potentials was similar across plots, but the relationship differed among plots against the soil moisture content. These results suggest that soil water potential is more indicative of the spatial occurrence of water repellency than moisture content on a hillslope where soil physicochemical properties vary. Plots located on ridge crests frequently exhibited lower water potentials and showed a higher areal fraction of water repellency, implying a greater chance of generating surface runoff by rainfall events.

AB A mathematical model based on orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system is developed which applies several algebraic stress models to simulate secondary currents in helically coiled channels. The model is validated using measurements in curved open channels with a simple rectangular cross-section. Secondary flows driven by both the centrifugal force and turbulence stresses were reproduced using LY and NR algebraic stress models, and SY nonlinear k-epsilon model. Impacts on secondary motion by variations in cross-section and channel curvature configurations have been discussed and the relationship between secondary flow pattern and different driving forces is analyzed. Predicted secondary currents in compound curved channels have been compared with published straight channel measurements on a qualitative basis. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The hydrology of a small karst drainage basin in Jamaica, the Martha Brae River basin, was examined using stable isotopes. Variations in the isotopic composition of the groundwaters sampled and their positions relative to the local meteoric water line on a delta-D/delta-O-18 diagram permitted the identification of two distinct groundwater types. The isotopic data also provided evidence that the most productive portion of the aquifer is divided by a major fault, which impedes groundwater flow. Information regarding the mechanisms and elevation of recharge was inferred from the delta-D versus delta-O-18 relationships and differences in isotopic composition, respectively.

AB A bank erosion mechanism and provisions to account for the associated planform changes and input of bank erosion products are added to a two-dimensional, depth-averaged model of river morphology. The model is applied to a reach of the meandering gravel-bed River Ohre (Eger) in the former state of Czechoslovakia. The agreement with observations is poor, but this can be ascribed to shortcomings in the flow and bed topography submodels rather than to shortcomings in the bank erosion submodel. Better results are expected when a three-dimensional flow model, equations for sediment mixtures and a bank accretion mechanism are included. This inclusion will have to be preceded by fundamental research on bank accretion mechanisms and on hiding and exposure effects in the relationship for the influence of gravity pull on sediment transport direction.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID MELTWATER MOVEMENT; SIERRA-NEVADA; SNOWPACKS; COVER
AB The percolation of water through snow is shown to be detectable with heat flux transducers (HFTs) at the base of, or embedded within, the snow. Theory indicates that the arrival of water at a HFT will result in a rapid drop in heat flow to negative values, followed by an exponential rise. Laboratory and field tests verify that the theory correctly predicts the form of the signal, and consideration of conditions in a snow cover suggest that it is unlikely the signal can be generated in any other way. Large (15 x 15 cm) HFTs were installed at the snow/ground interface at three locations in Alaska where rain on snow is common. During three winters, heat flux signals indicative of water percolating to the base of the snow were detected 23 times, often simultaneously at two or more sites. All signals were coincident with rain-on-snow events, though not all rain-on-snow events (there were a total of 27) were associated with distinctive heat flux signals. Signals were observed only when rainfall rates exceeded 1.5 cm d-1, and the character of the signal differed if the snow/ground interface was at or lower than 0-degrees-C. Observed delays between the start of rain and the arrival of water at the base of the snow ranged between 2 and 40 hours. A geometric analysis was used to calculate the spacing of percolation fingers or columns necessary to produce the observed number of times that water percolated onto the HFTs. The number of times there were abrupt changes in the temperature of thermistors installed in the snow adjacent to the HFTs was used in a similar manner. Results from both analyses suggest percolation columns with a mean spacing of about 25 cm, which is consistent with observations of these features in snow trenches.

DE overland flow; analytical solution; instantaneous response function
ID HYDROLOGIC RESPONSE
AB This paper deals with the derivation of the hydrological response of a hillslope on the assumption of quick runoff by surface runoff generation. By using the simple non-linear storage based model, first proposed by Horton, an analytical solution of the overland flow equations over a plane hillslope was derived. This solution establishes a generalization for different flow regimes of Horton's original solution, which is valid for the transitional flow regime only. The solution proposed was compared successfully with that of Horton and, for the turbulent flow regime, to the one derived from kinematic wave theory. This solution can be applied easily to both stationary and non-stationary rainfall excess events. An analytical solution for the instantaneous response function (IRF) was also derived. Finally, simple expressions to compute peak and time to peak of IRF are proposed. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Observations of discharge, temperature and suspended sediment made at a gauging site established near the snout of the Dokriani glacier in the western Himalayan region are presented. These observations were made during a scientific expedition to this glacier over 21 days (23.8.1992-12.9.1992). Because of harsh weather conditions, observations could not be made for a longer period. The minimum streamflow in the glacier melt stream was observed at 0700 h whereas the maximum was observed at 1800 h. The ratio of maximum to minimum flow was computed to be 1.81 from the continuous hourly observations. Based on an analysis of the recession of the hydrograph, it was found that the meltwater time lag from the accumulation zone of the glacier was more than seven times higher than that from the ablation zone. No specific relationship was observed between suspended sediment and discharge. The average values of the suspended sediment concentration and load were found to be 350 ppm and 180 t day(-1) respectively, for the study period. Weathering processes in different zones of the glacier were also studied to find out the source of the sediment transported by the meltwater into the melt stream. A high correlation coefficient (r = 0.89) was found between the glacier specific runoff and the air temperature at the gauging site. It showed that temperature alone can represent the melting of the glacier and may be considered for the hydrological modelling of glacier melt runoff. Based on observations over three days under clear weather conditions for isolated snow blocks, the average snowmelt factor was computed to be 5.4 mm/(degrees C. 6 h).

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE
AB Estimates of rainfall elasticity of streamflow in 219 catchments across Australia are presented. The rainfall elasticity of streamflow is defined here as the proportional change in mean annual streamflow divided by the proportional change in mean annual rainfall. The elasticity is therefore a simple estimate of the sensitivity of long-term streamflow to changes in long-term rainfall, and is particularly useful as an initial estimate of climate change impact in land and water resources projects. The rainfall elasticity of streamflow is estimated here using a hydrological modelling approach and a nonparametric estimator. The results indicate that the rainfall elasticity of streamflow (epsilon(p)) in Australia is about 2.0-3.5 (observed in about 70% of the catchments), that is, a 1% change in mean annual rainfall results in a 2.0-3.5% change in mean annual streamflow. The rainfall elasticity of streamflow is strongly correlated to runoff coefficient and mean annual rainfall and streamflow, where streamflow is more sensitive to rainfall in drier catchments, and those with low runoff coefficients. There is a clear relationship between the epsilon(p) values estimated using the hydrological modelling approach and those estimated using the nomparametric estimator for the 219 catchments, although the values estimated by the hydrological modelling approach are, on average, slightly higher. The modelling approach is useful where a detailed study is required and where there are sufficient data to reliably develop and calibrate a hydrological model. The nonparametric estimator is useful where consistent estimates of the sensitivity of long-term streamflow to climate are required, because it is simple to use and estimates the elasticity directly from the historical data. The nonparametric method, being model independent, can also be easily applied in comparative studies to data sets from many catchments across large regions.

AB Leakage from sinkhole lakes significantly influences recharge to the Upper Floridan aquifer in poorly confined sediments in northern Florida. Environmental isotopes (oxygen 18, deuterium, and tritium), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs: CFC-11, CCl3F; CFC-12, CCl2F2; and CFC-113, C2Cl3F3), and solute tracers were used to investigate groundwater flow patterns near Lake Barco, a seepage lake in a mantled karst setting in northern Florida. Stable isotope data indicated that the groundwater downgradient from the lake contained 11-67% lake water leakage, with a limit of detection of lake water in groundwater of 4.3%. The mixing fractions of lake water leakage, which passed through organic-rich sediments in the lake bottom, were directly proportional to the observed methane concentrations and increased with depth in the groundwater flow system. In aerobic groundwater upgradient from Lake Barco, CFC-modeled recharge dates ranged from 1987 near the water table to the mid 1970s for water collected at a depth of 30 m below the water table. CFC-modeled recharge dates (based on CFC-12) for anaerobic groundwater downgradient from the lake ranged from the late 1950s to the mid 1970s and were consistent with tritium data. CFC-modeled recharge dates based on CFC-11 indicated preferential microbial degradation in anoxic waters. Vertical hydraulic conductivities, calculated using CFC-12 modeled recharge dates and Darcy's law, were 0.17, 0.033, and 0.019 mid for the surficial aquifer, intermediate confining unit, and lake sediments, respectively. These conductivities agreed closely with those used in the calibration of a three-dimensional groundwater flow model for transient and steady state flow conditions.

AB This paper presents a new numerical method, the finite cell method (FCM), for simulating complex biological and chemical transport phenomena in porous media. It has the same advantages as the random walk method (RWM): there is no advection-dispersion equation to be solved, it is unnecessary to calculate the concentration distribution in each time step, and there is no numerical dispersion for the case of high Peclet number. The concept of FCM, however, is different from the RWM in several aspects. The minimum unit in the FCM is a cell that has a certain volume and carries variable mass, while in the RWM the minimum unit is a particle that has no volume but carries a certain mass. In the FCM we use multiple sets of cells to represent different phases in a porous medium. A mobile or an immobile cell may carry multiple biological and/or chemical components. Mass exchanges may occur not only between cells but also within cells. These mass exchanges can be described by different rules: equilibrium or nonequilibrium, linear or nonlinear. In this paper, a one-dimensional FCM code is developed and used to simulate the solute transport with nonequilibrium adsorption, colloid transport with kinetic deposition and release, and colloid facilitated transport with kinetic mass exchanges. The FCM solutions have been compared with available analytical solutions and the solutions obtained by the finite difference method (FDM). Results show that both FCM and FDM solutions match analytical solutions quite well when the concentration front is flat. When the concentration front is sharp, however, the FDM solutions become inaccurate because of numerical dispersion, but the FCM can still produce very accurate peak and tailing concentrations. From the example of colloid-facilitated transport, we can see how a complex chemical and biological transport procedure in porous media can be simulated directly by the FCM without solving any advection-dispersion equation.

AB Floods are amongst the most dangerous natural hazards in terms of economic damage. Whilst a growing number of studies have examined how river floods are influenced by climate change, the role of natural modes of interannual climate variability remains poorly understood. We present the first global assessment of the influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on annual river floods, defined here as the peak daily discharge in a given year. The analysis was carried out by simulating daily gridded discharges using the WaterGAP model (Water - a Global Assessment and Prognosis), and examining statistical relationships between these discharges and ENSO indices. We found that, over the period 1958-2000, ENSO exerted a significant influence on annual floods in river basins covering over a third of the world's land surface, and that its influence on annual floods has been much greater than its influence on average flows. We show that there are more areas in which annual floods intensify with La Nina and decline with El Nino than vice versa. However, we also found that in many regions the strength of the relationships between ENSO and annual floods have been non-stationary, with either strengthening or weakening trends during the study period. We discuss the implications of these findings for science and management. Given the strong relationships between ENSO and annual floods, we suggest that more research is needed to assess relationships between ENSO and flood impacts (e. g. loss of lives or economic damage). Moreover, we suggest that in those regions where useful relationships exist, this information could be combined with ongoing advances in ENSO prediction research, in order to provide year-to-year probabilistic flood risk forecasts.

AB In this article, we use a transfer function-noise (TFN) modelling strategy with single output and multiple/single inputs to study the relationships among a large unconfined aquifer in the upper Venetian plain (Northeast Italy), its recharge components (rainfalls and losing river) and a multi-layered confined system located in the middle Venetian plain. Model identification from the data raises a range of difficulties when seeking models with consistent physical behaviour, but no information related to the transfer function order and the lags with no zero weights is available. Therefore we use an automatic identification procedure for TFN models. The obtained results suggest that the rainfall component is more important than the river discharge in the unconfined aquifer, and the behaviours of the deep-confined aquifers are synchronous with that observed in the Badoere area.

AB Miscible displacement experiments were performed on intact sand columns ranging from 15 to 60 cm in length to determine whether bacterial deposition varies at the centimeter scale within aquifer sediments. A 1-pore-volume pulse of radiolabeled cell suspension was introduced into the columns followed by a 2-pore-volume flush of artificial groundwater. The columns were then drained and dissected along the axis of flow. At similar to 1-cm intervals, nine samples were removed for the enumeration of sediment-associated bacteria. Concentrations of sediment-associated (deposited) bacteria varied by up to 2 orders of magnitude in the direction perpendicular to flow demonstrating that bacterial deposition cannot be described mechanistically by a single rate coefficient. Incorporation of a distribution of sediment size and porosity values into Monte Carlo simulations indicates that physical heterogeneities are only partially responsible for the observed variability in deposited bacteria. A simple first-order model (classic filtration theory) adequately described the average spatial distribution of bacteria with depth within the 15-cm column. For the longer columns, however, the average concentration of deposited bacteria did not decrease exponentially with depth. A second-order model, modified to include an influent suspension of bacteria consisting of two subpopulations with separate sticking efficiencies (dual-alpha population), was required to describe the observed decreases of deposited bacteria with depth. A sensitivity analysis was performed with a first-order dual-alpha model to understand the effects of an influent suspension with two subpopulations of bacteria on the decrease of deposited bacteria with flow path length. Numerical simulations show that even for small fractions (0.01) of nonsticky bacteria, the decrease in deposited bacteria may deviate substantially from the exponential decrease expected from colloid-filtration theory. Results from experimental as well as numerical studies demonstrate the importance of column dissections for understanding bacterial deposition in saturated porous media.

AB Despite their common global occurrence, little work has been done on characterizing the hydraulic properties of root mats, particularly their hydraulic conductivity K. A common method for estimating K in the field is the piezometer slug test. In some root mat systems, the piezometer slug test may be the only technique, field or laboratory, that is able to provide reliable estimates of K. We installed 17 piezometers in a Cladium mariscus L. (Pohl) and Phragmites australis Cav. (Streud.) root mat in a UK fen. Tests were initiated by both slug insertion and slug withdrawal. Repeat tests were conducted on some piezometers to check for test consistency. Rapid recoveries after both slug insertion and withdrawal were found, with 90% recovery reached for all tests within 1500 s and for many within 300 s. We found significant and highly reproducible differences between recovery after insertion and recovery after withdrawal, with the latter being more rapid than the former. We invoke a reversible pore blocking mechanism to explain this behaviour. Many of the piezometers showed recoveries after withdrawal that were broadly consistent with the assumption of a rigid porous medium in which Darcy's law holds. Tests on four further piezometers were used to examine the impact of piezometer 'development', different slug sizes and the use of 'clean' water on test behaviour. The results from these test piezometers were difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, it appears that replacing 'dirty' water in the piezometer standpipe with clean water leads to more rapid recoveries and reduces the difference between recovery after insertion and recovery after withdrawal. The K of the root mat, as estimated from withdrawal tests on 14 piezometers and standardized to 20degreesC, ranged between 0.00144 and 0.03022 cm s(-1). This appears to be at the very top end of K values reported for fen peats and suggests that water can flow readily through this medium given sufficiently large hydraulic gradients.

AB Transverse mixing of solutes in steady state transport is of utmost importance for assessing mixing-controlled reactions of compounds that are continuously introduced into the subsurface. Classical spatial moments analysis fails to describe mixing because the tortuous streamlines in heterogeneous formations cause plume meandering, squeezing, and stretching, which affect transverse spatial moments even if there is no mass transfer perpendicular to the direction of flow. For transverse solute mixing, however, the decisive process is the exchange of solute mass between adjacent stream tubes. We therefore reformulate the advection-dispersion equation in streamline coordinates (i.e., in terms of the potential and the stream function values) and analyze how flux-related second central moments of plumes increase with dropping hydraulic potential. We compare the ensemble behavior of these second central moments in random two-dimensional heterogeneous flow fields with the moments in an equivalent homogeneous system, thus defining an equivalent effective transverse dispersion coefficient. Unlike transverse macrodispersion coefficients derived by traditional moment analysis, our mixing-relevant, flux-related coefficient does not increase with travel distance. We present closed-form solutions for the mean enhancement of transverse mixing by heterogeneity in two-dimensional isotropic media for linear laws of local-scale transverse dispersion. The mixing enhancement factor increases with the log conductivity variance but remains fairly low. We also evaluate the variance of our cumulative measure of transverse mixing, showing that heterogeneity causes substantial uncertainty of mixing. The analytical expressions are compared to numerical Monte Carlo simulations for various values of log conductivity variance, indicating good agreement with the analytical results at low variability. In the numerical simulations, we also consider nonlinear models of local-scale transverse dispersion.

AB Bed load particles in bedrock streams receiving lateral input from hillslopes may or may not show a clear, monotonic pattern of size reduction in the downstream direction. Both abrasion and selective sorting may play important roles in generating downstream fining. The objective of this study is to develop a physically based model of downstream fining in bedrock streams with lateral input based on both processes. A surface-based gravel transport relation for the size mixture is employed to account for the effect of selective sorting (differential transport). While the model produces silt and sand by abrasion, it is also assumed to loosely capture particle fracturing via a lumped abrasion coefficient embodied in Sternberg's law. The model is here tested against field data from Vieux Habitants River in Guadeloupe Island, which is located in the Caribbean Sea. The river shows clear downstream fining, and this pattern is captured reasonably well by the model. The model results indicate that abrasion (including fracturing) is solely responsible for the downstream fining pattern for most of the study reach of the Vieux Habitants River. Sensitivity analysis of the model has also been performed. The model results suggest that, in general, selective sorting by differential transport can play a role in downstream fining only in cases of streams with relatively fine gravel sizes and lower slopes. The results also indicate that abrasion (including fracturing) and selective sorting can be equally important for downstream fining in bedrock rivers. The results also suggest that future work should explicitly consider fracturing (comminution) separately from abrasion (wear) rather than lumping them in a Sternberg-type coefficient.

   a bimodal permeability distribution

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; GROUNDWATER-FLOW; POROUS-MEDIA; TRANSPORT;
   MODELS; FIELD
AB Permeability upscaling is physically investigated by making over 31,000 permeability measurements on a meter-scale block of volcanic tuff. The experiments are made possible by a specially adapted minipermeameter test system. Here we present and analyze 5185 permeability values, corresponding to five different sample supports (i.e., sample volumes) collected from one of the six block faces. The results show that the measured spatial permeability patterns, bimodal permeability distribution, and semivariogram structure/length scales are closely related to the strong textural contrast characterizing the tuff sample (i.e., highly porous pumice fragments embedded in a tight rock matrix). Each of the summary statistics shows distinct and consistent trends with increasing sample support (i.e., upscaling). As the sample support increases, the mean and variance decrease according to a power law relation, and the semivariogram range increases linearly, while the general structure of the semivariogram (isotropic, spherical model) remains unchanged. Interpretation of these results is pursued from two very different points of view; one addresses upscaling of the ensemble statistics, while the second examines upscaling from a local or pointwise perspective. We find the general upscaling trends exhibited by the ensemble statistics (given above,) to be consistent with the basic concepts of volume averaging, albeit nonlinear volume averaging. The bimodal characteristics of the tuff sample and the nonuniform flow conditions imparted by the minipermeameter contribute to the nonlinearity. The local analysis reveals strong variability in permeability upscaling from point to point throughout the sampling domain. Specifically, the permeability upscaling exhibited by zones rich in pumice is very different from zones dominated by matrix, unless the averaging volume is significantly larger than the spatial correlation scale.

ID STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX; RAINFALL DATA
AB Spatial and temporal characteristics of droughts in the western part of Bangladesh have been analysed. Standardized precipitation index method is used to compute the severity of droughts from the rainfall data recorded in 12 rainfall gauge stations for the period of 1961-1999. An artificial neural network is used to estimate missing rainfall data. Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to map the spatial extent of droughts of different severities in multiple time scales. Critical analysis of rainfall is also carried to find the minimum monsoon and dry months rainfall require in different parts of the study area to avoid rainfall deficit. The study shows that the north and north-western parts of Bangladesh are most vulnerable to droughts. A significant negative relationship between multiple ENSO index and rainfall is observed in some stations. Analysis of seasonal rainfall distribution, rainfall reliability and long-term rainfall trend is also conducted to aid prediction of future droughts in the area.

TI IMPACT OF FRACTURE COATINGS ON FRACTURE MATRIX FLOW INTERACTIONS IN
   UNSATURATED, POROUS-MEDIA
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID KNUDSEN DIFFUSION; CAPILLARY RISE; MODEL; WATER
AB Groundwater flow in unsaturated, fractured rock is often assumed to be dominated by the porous matrix component. This is frequently the result of reasoning that water flowing in the fractures is rapidly imbibed into the rock matrix by capillary suction forces with negligible resistance to uptake at the fracture/matrix interface. However, the existence of a low-permeability mineralized layer or coating at this interface may substantially reduce matrix imbibition and could consequently result in fracture-dominated flow. To test this idea, four tuff samples containing natural fractures were obtained from tuff formations in southern Nevada. By performing imbibition experiments into the matrix rock, across a mineralized fracture face and then across a fresh uncoated fracture face, water uptake as a function of time and coating was measured. A model combining Darcy's law and the Washburn equation has been used to describe the imbibition behavior. Before testing the tuff samples, the experimental technique and imbibition model were first tested using ordered sphere packings with known pore size and structure. From the tuff imbibition data, the ratio of the permeability through the mineralized face to the permeability through the uncoated face was found to be 0.3 (relatively little effect of the mineralized layer) for two samples, 0.01 for one sample, and 10(-7) (uptake strongly restricted by the mineralized layer) for one sample. Using a simple fracture flow model and the imbibition model mentioned above to simulate matrix uptake from the fracture, numerical simulations indicate that the existence of fracture coatings could significantly decrease the travel time and increase the travel depth of water flowing through fractures.

AB Understanding soil water content, theta, variability is important for monitoring and modeling of land surface processes as well as land and water management practices. With regards to in situ theta probes, it is sometimes assumed that a single local measurement can represent the larger domain, mostly for practical reasons. But there is a substantial amount of variability in theta at the field scale. As part of the Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote Sensing Experiment 2008 (BEAREX08), a high-density sensor network and intensive observational periods were developed to fully describe the theta conditions at the surface on the field scale, in support of the hydro-meteorological measurements being collected. A total of 20 theta stations were distributed over an irrigated and a non-irrigated field (similar to 10 ha each) and high-density (similar to every 5 cm) transects were measured for a high-detailed record. The network was able to provide large scale estimates of theta with an accuracy (root mean square error, RMSE) of 0.035 m(3)/m(3). The network was temporally stable with the exception being immediately during and after irrigation events. Irrigation caused significant increases in coefficients of variation due to the length of time (8-12 h) necessary to irrigate the entire field. The spatial distribution of surface theta was significantly affected by the row structure of the cotton plants, which was North-South in the field where transect measurements were made with a row spacing of 76 cm. At scales <35 cm (approximately half the row spacing), the distribution was correlated in the East-West direction. For scales larger than 35 cm in the East-West direction the correlation decreased, but was still present. In the North-South direction this discontinuity was not present, and theta followed a power law distribution. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Descriptions of fingered flow typically are based on linear instability theory, which becomes inappropriate once a finger has formed. In contrast, we obtain a self-similar solution to a moving finger with a curved interface by using the dynamic capillary pressure, where the capillary pressure depends on the velocity of the moving interface. From this solution we find analytical expressions for the shape and width of gravitationally driven fingers when they are fully developed. The solution has an unphysical limit of zero width at the limit of zero velocity owing to the simple dependence of capillary pressure on velocity. We discuss modifications to this dependence and compare the results to previous observations of fingering by Glass et al. [1989].

AB Six drip waters, which were actively depositing stalagmites in Lower Cave, Bristol, were analysed both for discharge and luminescence properties. Drip discharges were determined for two different years, and show a complex response to surface precipitation variations. Inter annual variability in drip discharge is demonstrated to be significantly higher than intra-annual variability, and discharge was demonstrated both to increase and decrease non-linearly with increased precipitation. Drip waters demonstrate a correlation between their luminescence intensity and drip discharge, with increased luminescence in winter as more organic matter is flushed through the aquifer. The strength of the relationship between luminescence intensity and discharge increases with increased discharge. The results presented here have implications for the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of annual growth laminae and the growth rates of stalagmite samples. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This article aims to identify the large-scale climate variables that yield significant statistical relationships with precipitation and discharge for a British river basin (Dyfi). Ranked correlation analysis was performed between gridded ERA-40 atmospheric data and Dyfi precipitation and discharge for individual months. Precipitation and discharge demonstrate significant negative correlation with mean sea level pressure (MSLP). Strongest MSLP correlation areas move from north of Britain in winter to central Britain in summer; this shift is associated with a displacement of geopotential (Z) and zonal wind (U). Movement of significant correlation regions (not captured by the North Atlantic Oscillation Index) highlights the dynamic nature of precipitation and river flow generating weather systems throughout the year. Existence of strong significant correlation shows potential for exploiting large-scale climate variables in forecasting precipitation and river flow in Britain.

   UNCONFINED VALLEY AQUIFER; CONTINUOUS TRANSMISSIVITY DEFINITION
AB In the southern part of Germany, shallow and mostly unconfined valley aquifers are widespread. The differential equation describing groundwater flow and its boundary conditions varies for different flow situations due to the transient nature of the groundwater table. The authors present a continuous physical-mathematical formulation of two-dimensional horizontal groundwater flow, which allows for a simultaneous computation of saturated unconfined, partially unsaturated, or confined aquifers. This requires a physically sensible functional relationship between the transmissivity and the piezometric head. To numerically approximate the nonlinear parabolic differential equation describing groundwater flow, the finite element method is used in the spatial directions and a finite difference technique for the time derivation. Newton's method is applied to solve the resulting nonlinear algebraic equation system.

AB An approach that makes use of meteorological measurements and the spatial perspective provided by satellite data to estimate the time series (monthly or daily) of evapotranspiration (ET) over heterogeneous terrain two-dimensionally has been developed and tested in the Urumqi River basin, Tianshan, China. The formulae utilized in the estimation of actual ET are based on Kojima's equation for a glacier/snow-covered area and Morton's complementary relationship for the other land-cover classes. Data integration and image processing for the estimated ET were all executed on a raster image file that combines Landsat TM (red and NIR reflectance data), land-cover classification and digital elevation model (DEM) in association with the use of meteorological data under a geographic information system (GIS) environment. The specific type of model (either Kojima's or Morton's) and the extent to which it should be applied are determined jointly by the land-cover categories and an algorithm describing the seasonal land-cover changes. The spatially distributed meteorological parameters driving the model were either interpolated from the routine observations with PRISM in the sparse network of meteorological stations or calculated by the relationships of these parameters with those routinely observed. Ground-surface albedo, data were derived by two approaches. For the season when the TM scene was acquired it was obtained by weighting the Landsat TM red and NIR reflectance data. For the other seasons, when the TM scene is not available, it was approximated by multiplying the empirical parameters in regard to each land-cover category with the albedo map of the season when the TM scene was available. As a result, time series of ET can be obtained not only quantitatively, but also visually as a two-dimensional image map. The approach proposed was applied to the Urumqi River basin, China. With field lysimeter data and estimates by the water balance method and the converted results from pan measurements as standard, a method validation was conducted and the accuracy of ET estimation by the approach was evaluated.

AB [1] Theory suggests that in the absence of transaction costs, pollution externalities can be mitigated efficiently by charging polluters a tax equal to the marginal social cost of pollution. All other regulatory mechanisms therefore may be no more efficient than a marginal cost pollution tax. We developed a stylized model of dynamic groundwater pollution without transaction costs to examine alternate policies. Using mitigation cost, tax burden, and excess burden we compared the relative efficiency of each tax policy under competitive market conditions. For groundwater nitrate pollution in a Midwestern farming region, results show that the least cost policy is a constant tax on the polluting input, followed by a variable tax on the polluting input and a pollution tax.

TI MAPPING WATERLOGGING OF SOILS USING DIGITAL TERRAIN MODELS

DT Article
DE GEOMORPHOLOGY; WATERLOGGING; DIGITAL TERRAIN MODEL; CONTRIBUTING AREAS
AB Maps of the potential waterlogging of soils were generated using hypotheses about the effect of topography on the soil water regime inspired by Beven and Kirkby's concept of saturation overland flow. The procedure was validated by comparing the simulated maps with maps derived from a 1 : 25 000 soil survey for two contrasting catchments. The value and limitations of the method are discussed in the light of this comparison. The approach proposed here is relevant to modelling the distribution of intensely waterlogged soils, provided the relationship between bedrock and the limit values is established. This approach can be used for several purposes: (1) to distinguish positional waterlogging from other types of waterlogging; (2) to control the quality and consistency of waterlogging maps; and (3) to create soil water regime maps for non-surveyed catchments. Conversely, soil water regime maps can be compared with contributing areas simulated by hydrological distributed models for validation purposes.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DE sediment flux into the sea; runoff and sediment sources; fluvial system;
   Yellow River
AB The runoff and sediment of large rivers usually come from different source areas, which make different contributions to the sediment flux into the sea. This has been studied with the example of the Yellow River in China, whose suspended sediment flux into the Bohai Sea accounts for 19.4% of the world total. The drainage basin of this river can be divided into four major water and sediment source areas. The sediment flux into the sea is found to be closely related to the water and sediment from the different source areas in the drainage basin and, accordingly, an empirical regression model has been established to express this relationship. According to this model, in each tonne (t) of sediment from the fine sediment producing area (FSA), 0.85 t (for yearly series) and 0.72 t (for event series) can be transported into the sea; in each tonne of sediment from the coarse sediment producing area (CSA), only 0.21 t (for yearly series) and 0.34 t (for event series) can be transported into the sea. Since the 1970s, the Yellow River's sediment flux into the sea has declined markedly and this reduction can be attributed to a great degree to the soil control measures in the fine sediment producing area. Coupling the models of this study to the previously established models for estimating the impacts of soil control measures on water and sediment balance in the Yellow River basin, a quantitative prediction may be made for the change of sediment flux into the sea that might result from climate change and human activities in the future.

ID SCALE
AB The use of GIS (geographical information systems) in hydrology and water management has its roots in ideas about the relationship between climate, catchment, channel and society that emerged more than a hundred years ago. From these beginnings, hydrological GIS has come to be defined primarily by modelling in the science domain and by asset (notably infrastructure) management in the water and river management domain. In both contexts it can be demonstrated that data quality represents the ultimate constraint, but that the quest for higher resolution may carry with it some significant problems. These constraints are developed through an examination of the potential use of high resolution spatial data in flood insurance applications of GIS. While the issues raised have clear technical implications, they also have important professional and ethical ramifications which are worthy of consideration as a backdrop to the current and future status of GIS in hydrology and water management.

A mathematical model based on spatial averaging theory proposed by Slattery [1] is derived. The large eddy simulation turbulence model and the moving-solid algorithm are incorporated for observing the wave behavior within porous media. The model is validated using two-dimensional experimental data for dam-break wave interaction with porous structures [2], three-dimensional dam-break wave evolution [3,4] as well as impact force of dam-break wave on an impermeable vertical column [5]. Numerical experiments of three-dimensional dam-break waves impacting porous media are subsequently performed. The net force on the structure and the horizontal velocity on a fixed point are also discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A common method of channel network extraction from digital elevation model (DEM) data is based on specification of a threshold area A(th), that is, the minimum support area required to drain to a point for a channel to form. Current efforts to predict A(th) from DEM data are inconclusive, and usually an arbitrary constant A(th) value is chosen for channel network extraction. In this paper, we study the effects of threshold area selection on the morphometric properties (such as drainage density, length of drainage paths, and external and internal links) and scaling properties (such as Horton's laws and fractal dimension) of a channel network. We also study the related problem of DEM data resolution and its effect on estimation of scaling properties. The results indicate that morphometric properties vary considerably with A(th), and thus values reported without their associated A(th) are meaningless and should be used in hydrologic analysis with caution. Also, the ''completeness'' of a channel network (in terms of having the outlet stream flowing directly into a higher-order stream) is found to depend on A(th) in a random unpredictable way. Even if only the complete channel networks are used in the analysis, the statistical variability of scaling properties estimates due to A(th) selection is significant and can be of comparable size to the variability due to DEM resolution and variability between estimates of different river networks. Our analysis highlights the need to carefully study the problem of network source representation or channel initiation scale from DEMs which will point to an appropriate A(th) for channel network extraction and estimation of morphometric properties.

AB Fluid electrical conductivity logging experiments introduced by Tsang et al. [1990] represent a new technology for studying the hydraulic properties of discrete fractures in open boreholes. These experiments consist of replacing water in the well bore with deionized water and then pumping the well to induce formation water to return to the well bore. During and after the fluid exchange the entire well is logged to measure fluid electrical conductivity (FEC). At locations where formation water enters the well there are abrupt increases in the borehole FEC, thereby revealing the location of hydraulically conductive fractures. As pumping continues, high FEC water moves up the well bore at a rate proportional to the total inflow rate below the observation point. Inflow rates and FECs of formation water associated with each fracture can be inferred by modeling the FEC profiles with the one-dimensional advective dispersion equation. In this paper I present an inverse model which estimates the inflow rates and formation FEC values that optimally fit observed FEC logs acquired during fluid exchange experiments described by Tsang ef al. [1990]. With this inverse model, inflow rates are constrained by the rate at which the well is pumped during the experiment. The forward model is solved numerically using a control volume finite difference scheme with power law upstream weighting and source term linearization. The inverse problem is solved using the Gauss-Newton iterative method. The rows of the Jacobian matrix, or the sensitivity coefficients, are calculated numerically with the same algorithm that solves the forward problem. Both constrained and unconstrained inverse models are used to interpret fluid logging experiments performed in research wells penetrating Piedmont rocks of North Carolina.

AB This paper presents an analytical solution of a radial flow to a pumping well at constant discharge located in a multilayered leaky aquifer system. The aquifer system is composed of alternating layer of aquifers and aquitards and is modeled after the theory of Neuman-Witherspoon and Herrera. The resulting coupled integrodifferential equation system is handled by the Laplace transform technique which removes not only the time variable but also the convolutional integral. Green's functions for the coupled elliptic partial differential equations are then sought. Utilizing a numerical Laplace inversion algorithm, the drawdown at any given time and location in any layer can be evaluated. Several examples are given for validation and exploration purposes.

AB Exchange of water and solutes across the stream-sediment interface is an important control for biogeochemical transformations in the hyporheic zone (HZ). In this paper, we investigate the interplay between turbulent stream flow and HZ flow in pool-riffle streams under various ambient groundwater flow conditions. Streambed pressures, derived from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, are assigned at the top of the groundwater model, and fluxes at the bottom of the groundwater model domain represent losing and gaining conditions. Simulations for different Reynolds numbers (Re) and pool-riffle morphologies are performed. Results show increasing hyporheic exchange flows (m(3)/d) for larger Re and a concurrent decrease in residence time (RT). Losing and gaining conditions were found to significantly affect the hyporheic flow field and diminish its spatial extent as well as rates of hyporheic exchange flow. The fraction of stream water circulating through the hyporheic zone is in the range of 1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(-6) per meter stream length, decreasing with increasing discharge. Complex distributions of pressure across the streambed cause significant lateral hyporheic flow components with a mean lateral travel distance of 20% of the longitudinal flow paths length. We found that the relationship between pool-riffle height and hyporheic exchange flow is characterized by a threshold in pool-riffle amplitude, beyond which hyporheic exchange flow becomes independent of riffle height. Hyporheic residence time distributions (RTD) are log-normally distributed with medians ranging between 0.7 and 19 h.

DE El Nino forecasts; Panama Canal management; forecast uncertainty;
   seasonal forecasting; management under uncertainty
ID NATIONAL-METEOROLOGICAL-CENTER; SYSTEM; CLIMATE
AB The Panama Canal relies on rain-fed streamflow into Gatun Lake, the canal's primary storage facility, for operations-principally ship passage and hydropower generation. Precipitation in much of Panama has a strong negative relationship with eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) and this relationship is reflected in Gatun Lake inflows. For example, the correlation coefficient between wet season (July-December) inflow and NINO3 SST is -0.53 over the period 1914-1997. Operational capabilities to predict tropical Pacific SSTs have been demonstrated by several forecast systems during the past decade, and (as we show) such SST forecasts can be used to reduce the uncertainty of estimates of future inflows (compared with climatological expectations). Because substantial reductions in lake inflow negatively impact canal operations, we wondered whether these forecasts of future inflows, coupled with a method for translating that information into effective operational policy, might result in more efficient canal management. A combined simulation/optimization/assessment "virtual" canal system was implemented and exercised using operational El Nino forecasts over the period 1981-1998. The results show the following main points:
   (i) At current demand levels, the canal system is relatively robust (insensitive to flow forecasts) unless flows are substantially reduced (i.e., during El Nino episodes) or forecasts are extremely accurate.
   (ii) The inclusion of accurately specified levels of forecast uncertainty is critical in developing economically beneficial policies.
   (iii) The situations in which imperfect forecast information can be useful lie between those where storage and future inflows are relatively high, and those where storage and inflows are relatively low. In the former case, demands can be met without the benefit of forecast information, and in the latter case even perfect forecast information cannot prevent operational curtailments.
   (iv) For a nominally configured canal system, the use of operational El Nino forecasts with appropriately specified uncertainty resulted in approximately SUS 20,000,000 (about 3%) in increased annual average income compared with the use of deterministic climatological forecasts.

AB Decision making on water resources management at ungauged, especially large-scale watersheds relies on hydrological modeling. Physically based distributed hydrological models require complicated setup, calibration, and validation processes, which may delay their acceptance among decision makers. This study presents an approach to develop a simple decision support tool (DST) for decision makers and economists to evaluate multiyear impacts of land use change and best management practices (BMPs) on water quantity and quality for ungauged watersheds. The example DST developed in the present study was based on statistical equations derived from Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulations and applied to a small experimental watershed in northwest New Brunswick. The DST was subsequently tested against field measurements and SWAT simulations for a larger watershed. Results from DST could reproduce both field data and model simulations of annual stream discharge and sediment and nutrient loadings. The relative error of mean annual discharge and sediment, nitrate-nitrogen, and soluble-phosphorus loadings were -6, -52, 27, and -16 %, respectively, for long-term simulation. Compared with SWAT, DST has fewer input requirements and can be applied to multiple watersheds without additional calibration. Also, scenario analyses with DST can be directly conducted for different combinations of land use and BMPs without complex model setup procedures. The approach in developing DST can be applied to other regions of the world because of its flexible structure.

AB A fractured rock aquifer may be viewed as a permeable fracture network embedded within a less permeable porous matrix. This permeability contrast gives rise to distinct pressure fields in the pore space and fractures, and therefore to a response to atmospheric loading different from that of nonfractured porous media. Assuming that fracture sizes and orientations are uncorrelated and sufficiently random to ensure homogeneous and isotropic elastic behavior of the rock mass at the continuum scale, an effective stress model proposed by Tuncay and Corapcioglu [1995] is used to develop a linear elastic stress-strain relationship for dual-porosity media. Elastic constants of the fractured rock mass, required by the model, are estimated using theoretical relations derived by Budiansky and O'Connell [1976]. The stress-strain relationship and the coupled continuity equations for flow in deformable fractured media are combined to derive expressions for the undrained, static-confined barometric efficiency of a dual-porosity medium. Two limiting cases are considered: the initial, instantaneous pressure response in the pore space and fractures due to a change of confining stress, and the later stage of pressure equilibrium between the two phases. The dual-porosity response model developed here may be used to characterize hydraulic properties in fractured aquifers, including low-porosity and low-permeability media. The model is evaluated on water level hydrograph data from a borehole tapping fractured volcanic rocks. Water level and barometric data are supplemented by independent measurements of matrix porosities, fracture spacing, and rock elastic properties, allowing an assessment of total porosity and specific storage at the site. For the observed static-confined barometric efficiency of 0.78 the instantaneous pressure response model yields plausible values for both parameters.

AB The primary purpose of this study is to develop regional models of the lower part of flow duration curves (LPFDCs) to synthesize low-flow characteristics at ungauged sites in southern Taiwan. Because of the close relationship between low strearnflow regimes and hydrogeological features, the model development first involved delimiting homogeneous hydrogeological regions by using two-step cluster analysis. Each homogeneous region was then discriminated by an equation developed on tire basis of its hydrogeological features, which was then used to determine Which of three sets of regional LPFDC models would be appropriate for a particular ungauged site. Each of the three sets of regional LPFDC models were developed using both conventional multivariate statistical regression and fuzzy regression. Thirty-four stream-gauged watersheds located in southern Taiwan provide the data set. The study results reveal that the regional LPFDC models developed in this study could be applied reasonably at ungauged sites. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) was evaluated for monitoring soil moisture at the Romney Marsh test site as part of the UK SAR Calibration and Crop Backscatter Experiment. A total of 18 C-band (5.3 GHz) ERS-1 SAR images were acquired during the three day orbit and co-registered. Accurate calibration of the backscatter measurements was achieved using calibration constants derived from an analysis of corner reflector target responses. Mean backscatter measurements were recorded for each field and compared with field data on soil moisture, surface roughness and rainfall patterns. A comparison of daily and hourly rainfall and soil moisture measurements with backscatter for different cover types showed that the observed trends in backscatter are dominated by moisture effects. A high positive correlation between volumetric soil moisture in the range 10-40% was observed for bare soil fields. A much weaker positive relationship between soil moisture and backscatter was observed for grassland fields.

   COLLUVIAL SOIL DEPTHS
AB A model is proposed for predicting the spatial variation in colluvial soil depth, the results of which are used in a separate model to examine the effects of root strength and vertically varying saturated conductivity on slope stability. The soil depth model solves for the mass balance between soil production from underlying bedrock and the divergence of diffusive soil transport. This model is applied using high-resolution digital elevation data of a well-studied site in northern California and the evolving soil depth is solved using a finite difference model under varying initial conditions. The field data support an exponential decline of soil production with increasing soil depth and a diffusivity of about 50 cm(2)/yr. The predicted pattern of thick and thin colluvium corresponds well with field observations. Soil thickness on ridges rapidly obtain an equilibrium depth, which suggests that detailed field observations relating soil depth to local topographic curvature could further test this model. Bedrock emerges where the curvature causes divergent transport to exceed the soil production rate, hence the spatial pattern of bedrock outcrops places constraints on the production law.
   The infinite slope stability model uses the predicted soil depth to estimate the effects of root cohesion and vertically varying saturated conductivity. Low cohesion soils overlying low conductivity bedrock are shown to be least stable. The model may be most useful in analyses of slope instability associated with vegetation changes from either land use or climate change, although practical applications may be limited by the need to assign values to several spatially varying parameters. Although both the soil depth and slope stability models offer local mechanistic predictions that can be applied to large areas, representation of the finest scale valleys in the digital terrain model significantly influences local model predictions. This argues for preserving fine-scale topographic detail and using relatively fine grid sizes even in analyses of large catchments.

TI AVAILABLE WATER OF A FERRALLITIC SOIL ALONG THE KOSSOU LAKESIDE SLOPE
   (IVORY-COAST) AS AFFECTED BY SOIL TEXTURE
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB The neutron probe method for in situ measurement of field capacity was applied to ferrallitic soils on the Kossou Lakeside slope (Ivory coast). For better utilisation of the natural resources, a study was conducted to determine the influence of the lake on the availability of soil water to plants along the lakeside slope. Two methods, one gravimetric and the other neutronic, were used to evaluate soil water content and its variation with time. Five access tubes were placed along the slope and were monitored during the study. The infiltration rate determined at three of the measuring sites was higher in the top soil layers than in the deeper soil layers. Drainage and redistribution data show a juxtaposition of two infiltration kinetics, the first being exponential and the second linear. The, extrapolation of the second kinetic (slow) to the start of drainage gave, for the first 600 mm of soil, field capacities of 154, 184 and 163 mm for sites T1, T3 and T5 respectively. These differences were specifically related to the porosity of the sites under study. An analysis of the soil water profiles showed that the soil moisture near the lake was always higher than the permanent wilting point. The influence of the lake was not apparent during the long rainy season because of the steady decline of the water table. The water availability then depended upon the rainfall distribution and the specific characteristics of each of the sites, especially soil texture and structure. A linear relationship was found between soil moisture estimated by the neutronic and the gravimetric methods with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 80 to 0. 96. The data also showed that the neutron probe method did not systematically underestimate the soil moisture of the top layers. This response seemed to be associated with the fraction of coarse sand. As soil moisture increased, data from the neutron probe method converged toward the gravimetric data regardless of the site.

AB Based on self-organizing map, a method that can perform cluster analysis and discrimination analysis in one step is proposed in this paper. Using the proposed method, one can view the relative topological relationships of input patterns, determine the proper number of clusters, and assign unknown patterns to known clusters without losing any information of input patterns. Regarding the capability of determining the proper number of clusters, the proposed method is superior to conventional cluster analysis. The discrimination results also show that the assignments of unknown patterns to known clusters are reasonable using the proposed method. The advantages of the proposed method are also demonstrated by an application to the hydrological factors affecting low-flow duration curves in southern Taiwan. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI On the second-order correction to velocity covariance for

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID FLOW; TRANSPORT; MOMENTS; TENSOR
AB Second-order perturbation theory has recently been applied to flow and transport in statistically isotropic porous media. The second-order head correction has been found to be important in the velocity covariance and thus also in transport. This result was obtained by using numerical integration on the second-order correction for velocity covariance with the higher-order head fluctuation. The present paper is a continuation of previous studies and aims at deriving an analytical, closed-form expression for the second-order correction term involving higher-order head fluctuation in lognormal statistically isotropic media with exponential log conductivity correlation. The higher-order correction for velocity covariance is found to be most significant in the transverse direction, a result that is consistent with previous analysis.

AB Hydrologic connectivity between catchment upland and near stream areas is essential for the transmission of water, solutes, and nutrients to streams. However, our current understanding of the role of riparian zones in mediating landscape hydrologic connectivity and the catchment scale export of water and solutes is limited. We tested the relationship between the duration of hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) hydrologic connectivity and the rate and degree of riparian shallow groundwater turnover along four HRS well transects within a set of nested mountain catchments (Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, MT). Transect HRS water table connectivity ranged from 9 to 123 days during the annual snowmelt hydrograph. Hillslope water was always characterized by low specific conductance (similar to 27 mu S cm(-1)). In transects with transient hillslope water tables, riparian groundwater specific conductance was elevated during base flow conditions (similar to 127 mu S cm(-1)) but shifted toward hillslope signatures once a HRS groundwater connection was established. The degree of riparian groundwater turnover was proportional to the duration of HRS connectivity and inversely related to the riparian: hillslope area ratios (buffer ratio; r(2) = 0.95). We applied this relationship to the stream network in seven subcatchments within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest and compared their turnover distributions to source water contributions measured at each catchment outlet. The amount of riparian groundwater exiting each of the seven catchments was linearly related (r(2) = 0.92) to their median riparian turnover time. Our observations suggest that the size and spatial arrangement of hillslope and riparian zones along a stream network and the timing and duration of groundwater connectivity between them is a first-order control on the magnitude and timing of water and solutes observed at the catchment outlet.

AB Subsurface hydro-geomechanical properties crucially underpin the management of Earth's resources, yet they are predominantly measured on core samples in the laboratory while little is known about the representativeness of in situ conditions. The impact of Earth and atmospheric tides on borehole water levels is ubiquitous and can be used to characterise the subsurface. We illustrate that disentangling the groundwater response to Earth (M2) and atmospheric tidal (S2) forces in conjunction with established hydraulic and linear poroelastic theories leads to a complete determination of the whole hydro-geomechanical parameter space for unconsolidated systems. Further, the characterisation of consolidated systems is possible when using literature estimates of the grain compressibility. While previous field investigations have assumed a Poisson's ratio from literature values, our new approach allows for its estimation under in situ field conditions. We apply this method to water level and barometric pressure records from four field sites with contrasting hydrogeology. Estimated hydro-geomechanical properties (e.g. specific storage; hydraulic conductivity; porosity; shear, Young's, and bulk moduli; Skempton's and Biot-Willis coefficients; and undrained or drained Poisson's ratios) are comparable to values reported in the literature, except for consistently negative drained Poisson's ratios, which is surprising. Our results reveal an anisotropic response to strain, which is expected for heterogeneous (layered) lithological profiles. Closer analysis reveals that negative Poisson's ratios can be explained by in situ conditions differing to those from typical laboratory core tests and the small strains generated by Earth and atmospheric tides. Our new approach can be used to passively, and therefore cost-effectively, estimate subsurface hydro-geomechanical properties representative of in situ conditions and it improves our understanding of the relationship between geological heterogeneity and geomechanical behaviour.

AB Pore network models of two-phase flow in porous media are widely used to investigate constitutive relationships between saturation and relative permeability as well as capillary pressure. However, results of many studies show a discrepancy between calculated relative permeability and corresponding measured values. Often, calculated values overestimate the measured values. An important feature of almost all pore network models is that the resistance to flow is assumed to come from pore throats only; i.e., the resistance of pore bodies to the flow is considered to be negligible compare to the resistance of pore throats. We contend that this simplification may considerably affect the results for relative permeability curves. In this study, we present a new formulation for pore network modeling of two-phase flow, which allows for the calculation of wetting phase fluxes in the edges of (partially) drained pores. In a quantitative investigation, we have shown the significance of this effect. The pore space is represented by cubic pore bodies and parallelepiped pore throats in a Multi-Directional Pore Network model. This model allows for a distribution of coordination numbers ranging between 1 and 26. This topological property, together with geometrical distributions of pore sizes, is used to mimic the microstructure of real porous media. In the presence of the nonwetting phase, the wetting fluid is considered to fill only spaces along edges of cubic pore bodies. We show that the resistance to the flow of the wetting phase within these filaments of fluids are comparable to the resistance to the wetting phase flow within pore throats. Resulting saturation-relative permeability relationships show very good agreement with measured curves. Explicit representation of wetting phase filaments and calculation of different fluxes within pore bodies may also lead to improved predictions of transport properties such as dispersivities and mass transfer coefficients.

TI COMPARISON OF ISOTHERMAL AND ISOBARIC WATER-RETENTION PATHS IN
   NONSWELLING POROUS MATERIALS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Water in porous media near the Earth's surface is subject to large fluctuations in pore water pressure and temperature, often causing significant changes in the degree of saturation.  Quantitative comparisons of isothermal versus isobaric water retention are necessary to accurately predict changes in saturation due to the coupled influence of changes in the pore water matric potential psi and temperature T.  Yet there is a lack of experimental measurements of isobaric (i.e., constant psi) water retention, inhibiting comparisons between isobaric and isothermal processes.  In the present study the influence of the chronological sequence of changes in psi and T is examined to determine whether the volumetric water content theta for any given final psi-T condition is independent of the psi-T sequence, when theta changes monotonically.  To obtain the necessary data for these comparisons, isothermal water retention experiments were performed over a range in psi from 0 to - 100 kPa, and isobaric water retention experiments were performed at 20-degrees and 80-degrees-C on core samples of a sandy soil and a nonwelded tuff.  Results provide further evidence that the effect of T on psi is considerably greater than estimates based on pore water capillary theory.  For these materials the thermal enhancement of psi was 4-12 times greater than capillary theory would predict.  The effect of T on theta during isobaric water retention was several times greater for drying (warming) conditions than for wetting (cooling) conditions at a given psi, resulting in net losses in theta ranging from 3 to 30%.  For a given final psi at 80-degrees-C, virtually identical theta values were obtained regardless of the chronological sequence of isothermal and isobaric drainage paths for both materials.  This confirms the validity of unique theta (psi, T) surfaces describing monotonic changes in theta as functions of both psi and T in nonswelling porous materials.  Determination of these theta (psi, T) response surfaces for drying and wetting should yield water retention envelopes, useful in modeling water retention in near-surface environments where both psi and T vary.

AB The Gould-Dincer suite of techniques (normal, log-normal and Gamma), which is used to estimate the reservoir capacity-yield-reliability (S-Y-R) relationship, is the only known available procedure in the form of a simple formula, based on annual streamflow statistics, that allows one to compute the S-Y-R relationship for a single storage capacity across the range of annual streamflow characteristics observed globally. Several other techniques are available but they are inadequate because of the restricted range of flows on which they were developed or because they are based on the Sequent Peak Algorithm or are not suitable to compute steady-state reliability values. This paper examines the theoretical basis of the Gould-Dincer approach and applies the three models to annual streamflow data for 729 rivers distributed world-wide. The reservoir capacities estimated by the models are compared with equivalent estimates based on the Extended Deficit Analysis, Behaviour analysis and the Sequent Peak Algorithm. The results suggest that, in the context of preliminary water resources planning, the Gould-Dincer Gamma model provides reliable estimates of the mean first passage time from a full to empty condition for single reservoirs. Furthermore, the storage estimates are equivalent to deficits computed using the Extended Deficit Analysis for values of drift between 0.4 and 1.0 and the values are consistent with those computed using a Behaviour simulation or a Sequent Peak Algorithm. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the effect on storage of the four main streamflow statistics confirms that the influential ones are mean and standard deviation, while effects of skew and serial correlation are orders of magnitude lower. This finding suggests that the simple reduced form of the Gould-Dincer equation may profitably be used for regional studies of reservoir reliability subject to climate change scenarios based on regional statistics, without having to perform calculations based on time series. which may not be easily obtained.

AB A capacitance probe has been employed to measure the spatial and temporal change of soil moisture in a weathered soil profile with heterogeneous texture characteristics. Measurements were made to a depth of 2 m at intervals of 2 cm. The field work was carried out during a wetting-up period in a subtropical monsoonal environment in the Middle Hills of Nepal. Calibrations of the frequency readings against gravimetric and volumetric soil moisture are compared. It was found that the frequency reading correlates much better with the volumetric soil moisture. Although the soil is spatially heterogeneous in its particle size, porosity and bulk density, it was found that a single regression equation can be used to represent the relationship between the frequency reading of the capacitance probe and volumetric soil moisture. The results demonstrate that the capacitance probe enables the investigation of soil moisture variation temporally and spatially at high resolution and can measure a wide moisture range.

AB A unified linear theory for the transport of adsorbing solutes through soils is presented and applied to analyze movement of napropamide through undisturbed soil columns. The transport characteristics of the soil are expressed in terms of the travel time distribution of the mobile phase which is then used to incorporate local interaction processes. This approach permits the analysis of all linear transport processes, not only the small subset for which a differential description is known. From a practical point of view, it allows the direct use of measured concentrations or fluxes of conservative solutes to characterize the mobile phase without first subjecting them to any model. For complicated flow regimes, this may vastly improve the identification of models and estimation of their parameters for the local adsorption processes.

LA English
DT Article
ID FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTION; UNIT-HYDROGRAPH; HYDROLOGIC SIMILARITY;
   RAINFALL; DERIVATION
AB A new rationale for deriving the probability distribution of floods and help in understanding the physical processes underlying the distribution itself is presented. On the basis of this a model that presents a number of new assumptions is developed. The basic ideas are as follows: (1) The peak direct streamflow Q can always be expressed as the product of two random variates, namely, the average runoff per unit area u(a) and the peak contributing area a; (2) the distribution of u(a) conditional on a can be related to that of the rainfall depth occurring in a duration equal to a characteristic response time tau(a) of the contributing part of the basin; and (3) tau(a) is assumed to vary with a according to a power law. Consequently, the probability density function of Q can be found as the integral, over the total basin area A, of that of a times the density function of u(a) given a. It is suggested that u(a) can be expressed as a fraction of the excess rainfall and that the annual flood distribution can be related to that of Q by the hypothesis that the flood occurrence process is Poissonian. In the proposed model it is assumed, as an exploratory attempt, that a and u(a) are gamma and Weibull distributed, respectively. The model was applied to the annual flood series of eight gauged basins in Basilicata (southern Italy) with catchment areas ranging from 40 to 1600 km(2). The results showed strong physical consistence as the parameters tended to assume values in good agreement with well-consolidated geomorphologic knowledge and suggested a new key to understanding the climatic control of the probability distribution of floods.

AB More than 40 years of re-vegetation using mainly xerophytic shrubs Artemisia ordosica Krasch. and Caragana korshinskii Kom. at Shapotou Desert Experimental Research Station near Lanzhou, China has resulted in established dwarf-shrub and herbaceous cover on sand dunes. Precipitation, as the sole source of water replenishment in the semiarid area, plays a pertinent role in sustaining the desert ecosystem. A field study was conducted to (a) measure interception loss on shrub canopies during individual rainfall events, (b) determine the canopy storage capacity of individual plants, and (c) explore the relationship between interception and rainfall parameters. The total rainfall and its respective partitions as throughfall were determined and the interception losses in the studied ecosystem were quantified. Interception loss was shown to differ among the xerophyte taxa studied. During the growing seasons, the average shrub community interception loss is 6.9% and 11.7% of the simultaneous overall precipitation, for A. ordosica and C. korshinskii, respectively. Taking into account the observed rainfall conditions and vegetation cover characteristics, it was concluded that the interception loss was 2.7% of the total annual precipitation verified in the period for the A. ordosica community with an average cover of 30%, canopy projection area of 0.8 m(2) and canopy storage capacity of 0.75 mm. In contrast, interception loss for the C korshinskii community was 3.8% with an average cover of 46%, canopy projection area of 3.8 m(2) and canopy storage capacity of 0.71 mm. For individual plants of both shrubs, the proportion of interception loss to gross rainfall decreased notably as the rainfall intensity increased between 0 and 2 min h(-1), while it tended to remain constant at about 0.1-0.2 for A. ordosica and 0.1-0.3 for C. korshinskii when the rainfall intensity was > 2 mm h(-1).

AB A heuristic approach based on facility location theory effectively augments groundwater quality monitoring configurations through the strategic siting of additional wells.  The approach is an alternative to variance-based schemes previously established for the augmentation problem.  The method developed herein is practical in that it (1) is relatively easily understood, (2) is not difficult to implement and solve, and (3) does not require a large number of preexisting observation points.  The approach has been applied to a case study involving a landfill-contaminated buried valley aquifer in southwest Ohio.  Configurations derived by the heuristic approach exhibit two key characteristics:  (1) location of wells near areas of high estimated contaminant concentration and (2) interwell separation distances that facilitate areal plume coverage.

ID EQUILIBRIUM EVAPORATION; BOUNDARY-LAYER; ADVECTION
AB The Priestley and Taylor [1972] method (PT) and the complementary relationship (CR) introduced by Bouchet [1963] for the estimation of extended area or regional evapotranspiration are examined using a model of the coupled interactions between the mixed layer and the land surface. The model is shown to be in good agreement with observations from the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment. It appears that the parameter cu in the PT is slightly lower than the suggested constant value 1.26 and is quite insensitive to the growth of the boundary layer. We find some support for the CR but do not resolve the problem of estimating the potential evaporation under unstressed conditions.

ID CONSTRAINED INVERSION; TIME-DOMAIN
AB Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods supply data over large areas in a cost-effective way. We used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to classify the geophysical signal into a meaningful geological parameter. By using examples of known relations between ground-based geophysical data (in this case electrical conductivity, EC, from electrical cone penetration tests) and geological parameters (presence of glacial till), we extracted learning rules that could be applied to map the presence of a glacial till using the EC profiles from the airborne EM data. The saline groundwater in the area was obscuring the EC signal from the till but by using ANN we were able to extract subtle and often non-linear, relations in EC that were representative of the presence of the till. The ANN results were interpreted as the probability of having till and showed a good agreement with drilling data. The glacial till is acting as a layer that inhibits groundwater flow, due to its high clay-content, and is therefore an important layer in hydrogeological modelling and for predicting the effects of climate change on groundwater quantity and quality.

ID FLUID-FLOW; FRACTURE
AB Field and laboratory methods for estimating and interpreting parameters obtained from field borehole and laboratory core experiments are examined using permeability data interpreted from air and water injection tests in variably saturated fractured tuff at the Apache Leap Tuff Site in central Arizona. The tuff at the field site has a matrix porosity of approximately 17.5% and contains numerous near-vertical fractures at an average spacing of 1.3 m. More than 270 m of 6.4-cm-diameter oriented core were collected from boreholes drilled to a maximum depth below the surface of 30 m and at a vertical angle of 45-degrees. Laboratory estimates of absolute permeabilities using air and water as the test fluids were acquired at a range of matric potentials for 105, 5-cm-long core segments extracted at approximately 3-m intervals containing no obvious fractures. Field scale estimates of fractured rock permeabilities using air and water as test fluids were obtained at ambient matric suctions and water saturated conditions, respectively. The field tests were conducted along 3-m intervals within boreholes with the intervals centered on core sampling positions. Borehole and core permeabilities demonstrate substantial spatial variability, with variations exceeding three orders of magnitude. Laboratory core data show a strong relationship between permeabilities using saturated water and oven-dry air injection tests with the latter demonstrating the Klinkenberg effect. The influence of matric suction on permeabilities is used to demonstrate that relative permeabilities do not sum to a constant for a wide range of matric suction. Only weak relationships exist between permeabilities measured in boreholes versus cores for both water and air. Permeabilities measured in boreholes using air are shown to provide good estimates of permeabilities measured using water into initially unsaturated, fractured rock at the Apache Leap Tuff Site.

AB The unique topography of the pothole region of the North American prairies creates challenges for properly determining basin contributing area. Numerous depressions or potholes within the landscape impound runoff. However, potholes can fill-spill' resulting in surface water connections between the potholes. Surface water connectivity between potholes ultimately influences basin contributing area. Currently, automated methods, such as landscape analysis tools, treat depressions in the landscape as artifacts and simply fill the depressions to delineate a drainage basin. Using this method to calculate contributing area assumes that all surface storage has been satisfied (threshold) and the drainage basin will contribute 100% of its area for all runoff events. However, most runoff events in the prairie pothole region are pre-threshold events that contribute only a portion of surface runoff to the outlet. These pre-threshold events have surface storage that varies because of antecedent water levels and have a variable or dynamic potential to store further runoff in the basin. Government agencies have developed methodologies for determining pre-threshold contributing areas, but these methodologies do not incorporate current technologies and, as a result, have limitations. We propose an automated method for determining contributing area that incorporates the fill-spill of prairie potholes. The algorithm, which uses the D-8 drainage direction method, automates a methodology for identifying and quantifying runoff contributing area. Any algorithm that determines pre-threshold contributing area, must allow the DEM to be filled in an incremental manner. This will simulate increasing pond levels, and the resulting decrease in available storage in the basin, in response to runoff events. The SPILL algorithm is an iterative solution that increases the magnitude of input runoff events and records the decreasing change in available surface storage and the increase in contributing area until the storage threshold is reached and the contributing area reaches 100%. Through application of the algorithm on prairie pothole region basins, we test proposed conceptual curves that describe a hypothesized non-linear relationship between decreasing potential storage in the landscape and contributing area. Results indicate that the proposed conceptual curves represent the relationship between potential surface storage and contributing area in the test basins very well.

AB We consider the appropriateness of "rating curves" and other log linear models to estimate the fluvial transport of nutrients. Split-sample studies using data from tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay reveal that a minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE), based on a simple log linear model, provides satisfactory load estimates, even in some cases where the model exhibited significant lack of fit. For total nitrogen (TN) the average difference between the MVUE estimates and the observed loads ranges from -8% to +2% at the four sites. The corresponding range for total phosphorus (TP) is -6% to +5%. None of these differences is statistically significant. The observed variability of the MVUE load estimates for TN and TP, which ranges from 7% to 25% depending on the case, is accurately predicted by statistical theory.

AB Soil solution and free-flowing soilwater were sampled at various depths for 3 years in a plot of holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) in the Montseny mountains (NE Spain).  The soil solution retained at -65M kPa in the mineral soil at depths of 20 and 40 cm had a different chemistry from that of throughflow under the humic layer (H-layer throughflow) and, to a lesser extent, from deep subsurface flow.  The dominant mobile anion in the soil solution and the deep flow was SO4(2-), whereas in the H-layer, SO4(2-) was overridden by alkalinity.
   H-Layer throughflow chemistry was extremely variable, in consequence of the large number of biogeochemical processes affecting it (e.g. rainfall chemistry, dry deposition, leaching from canopy and litter, decomposition), and of the quantity of water available for transport of solutes.  The chemistry of the soil solution was more predictable, as it was governed mainly by nutrient uptake, cation exchange reactions and the seasonal wetting and drying cycles.  The chemistry of the deep subsurface flow was often intermediate between that of the soil solution and that of the H-layer throughflow; this suggested a mixture of displaced pre-event soil solution and of H-layer throughflow circulating through preferential flow paths.  With humid antecedent conditions, the chemistry of the deep subsurface flow approached that of the soil solution.
   The cation concentration relationships in the soil solution were strongly linear.  In a homogeneous soil, cation exchange theory predicts this to be expected only for cations of the same charge, whereas cations of different charges should follow power relationships.  Our results, however, are consistent with a theoretical approach involving cation exchange reactions in a highly heterogeneous environment.  Indeed, our study illustrates the heterogeneous nature of the soils, as the power relationship has been obscured completely.
   Soilwater chemistries were markedly different from those of streamwater, particularly under dry conditions.  During baseflow, the stream is fed by groundwater, and the soils are probably disconnected from the stream.  During humid periods, the chemistry of the streamwater tends toward that of the deep subsurface flow.  Chemical hydrograph separation indicates that, on average, stormflow water comprises an approximately one to one mixture of groundwater and deep subsurface flow.

TI Experimental study of a bimolecular reaction in Poiseuille flow
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDIA
AB A bimolecular chemical reaction (reactant1 + reactant2 --> products) in laminar Poiseuille flow is experimentally observed using a spectrophotometer. The reaction rate (r(m)) follows the second-order rate law; that is, r(m) = kappa c(1)c(2), where c(m) (m = 1, 2) are the reactant concentrations. The reaction rate constant kappa is independently estimated by monitoring the reaction kinetics in a completely mixed batch reactor using the stopped-flow technique. In the reactive transport experiments, the reactants are introduced in a tube and are initially separated by a sharp interface. The variation of the fluid velocity over the cross section of the tube causes the concentrations of the reactants to vary around their cross-sectional average values ((c) over bar(m)). These spatial variations in the concentrations (c(m)') influence the overall reaction rate. The cross-sectional average reaction rate is given by (r) over bar(m) = kappa<(c(1)c(2))over bar> = kappa((c) over bar(1)(c) over bar(2) + <(c(1)c(2))over bar>) = kappa(1 + s)(c) over bar(1)(c) over bar(2) where s = <(c(1)'c(2)')over bar>/((c) over bar(1)(c) over bar(2)) is the segregation intensity. The experimentally observed breakthrough concentration of the product is in agreement with a numerical model that accounts for the effects of the segregation intensity. On ignoring the influence of the segregation intensity, the predicted product concentration substantially exceeds the experimental observations. This shows that for initially non-overlapping reactants the segregation intensity is negative (s < 0) and that the overall chemical transformation rate in flowing systems can be significantly different from that implied by substituting the mean concentrations in the expression for the reaction rate.

TI GEOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF INTERWELL TRANSMISSIVITY IN HETEROGENEOUS
   AQUIFERS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SIMULATION; FLOW
AB Steady state flow between an injection well and a pumping well in a heterogeneous confined aquifer is investigated using a combined numerical-empirical approach. Transmissivity at the measurement or point support scale is modeled as an isotropic, stationary, multivariate lognormal spatial random function. In a recent study (Desbarats, 1992) it was found that the effective transmissivity of a single-well radial flow system was very well estimated by a spatial geometric average of point transmissivities weighted by their inverse squared distance from the well bore axis. This result provides an approximate solution for steady state drawdown in a heterogeneous medium which can be used with the principle of superposition to derive an expression for the interwell head difference in a dipole well configuration. The interwell transmissivity corresponding to this head difference is shown to be the harmonic mean of transmissivities averaged over circular regions centered at each well. This deterministic averaging law and the geostatistical model for point transmissivities are combined in order to derive expressions for the ensemble mean and variance of interwell transmissivity. Expressions are also obtained for the conditional moments of interwell transmissivity when values at the two wells are available from core measurements. Multiple realizations of the heterogeneous transmissivity field, discretized on a nodal grid, are generated using the turning bands method. Interwell transmissivities obtained by spatial averaging over the grid are compared with corresponding true effective values obtained numerically using a finite difference model of steady state interwell flow. Empirical and numerical values are found to be in excellent agreement for variances of log transmissivity as high as 5. Further numerical experiments show that results of this study are relatively insensitive to moderate departures from the multivariate lognormal transmissivity model.

AB The role that hydrology plays in governing the interactions between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen in rivers draining lowland, agricultural landscapes is currently poorly understood. In light of the potential changes to the production and delivery of DOC and nitrate to rivers arising from climate change and land use management, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of hydrological controls on DOC and nitrate dynamics in such catchments. We measured DOC and nitrate concentrations in river water of six reaches of the lowland river Hampshire Avon (Wiltshire, southern UK) in order to quantify the relationship between BFI (BFI) and DOC: nitrate molar ratios across contrasting geologies (Chalk, Greensand, and clay). We found a significant positive relationship between nitrate and BFI (p < 0.0001), and a significant negative relationship between DOC and BFI (p < 0.0001), resulting in a non-linear negative correlation between DOC: nitrate molar ratio and BFI. In the Hampshire Avon, headwater reaches which are underlain by clay and characterized by a more flashy hydrological regime are associated with DOC: nitrate ratios > 5 throughout the year, whilst groundwater-dominated reaches underlain by Chalk, with a high BFI have DOC: nitrate ratios in surface waters that are an order of magnitude lower (< 0.5). Our analysis also reveals significant seasonal variations in DOC: nitrate transport and highlights critical periods of nitrate export (e.g. winter in sub-catchments underlain by Chalk and Greensand, and autumn in drained, clay sub-catchments) when DOC: nitrate molar ratios are low, suggesting low potential for in-stream uptake of inorganic forms of nitrogen. Consequently, our study emphasizes the tight relationship between DOC and nitrate availability in agricultural catchments, and further reveals that this relationship is controlled to a great extent by the hydrological setting.

AB Spatial patterns in suspended sediment transport and storage along the Sacramento River were assessed by evaluating the suspended sediment budget for the main channel accounting for all tributaries and diversions. Time series analysis was employed to quantify the relationship between streamflow and suspended sediment concentration for gauging stations along the main channel and signature tributaries. Sediment concentration records (of 2-yr duration) were extended using Box-Jenkins transfer function models to calculate annual rates of suspended sediment discharge over a 32-year period since dam construction on the Sacramento River. The suspended sediment budget was evaluated to identify reaches of net erosion or deposition. The results of the budget suggest the influence of tectonics and anthropogenic channel modification.

AB A logistic model is estimated to determine factors that have influenced the formation of bilateral international water treaties over the last 60 years. Results indicate that the larger a water basin is as a percent of a country's size, the more likely the country is to form a treaty regarding its management. On the other hand, the more control over the water basin any given country has, the less likely it will be involved in a treaty. The results also support aspects of two competing theories about the role of country differences, that in some cases they serve as obstacles to treaty formation yet in other cases they encourage treaty formation to formalize management when informal arrangements are not adequate.

AB Errors, gaps, and outliers complicate and sometimes invalidate the analysis of time series. While most fields have developed their own strategy to clean the raw data, no generic procedure has been promoted to standardize the pre-processing. This lack of harmonization makes the inter-comparison of studies difficult, and leads to screening methods that can be arbitrary or case-specific. This study provides a generic pre-processing procedure implemented in R (ctbi for cyclic/trend decomposition using bin interpolation) dedicated to univariate time series. Ctbi is based on data binning and decomposes the time series into a long-term trend and a cyclic component (quantified by a new metric, the Stacked Cycles Index) to finally aggregate the data. Outliers are flagged with an enhanced box plot rule called Logbox that corrects biases due to the sample size and that is adapted to non-Gaussian residuals. Three different Earth science datasets (contaminated with gaps and outliers) are successfully cleaned and aggregated with ctbi. This illustrates the robustness of this procedure that can be valuable to any discipline.

AB Why do people engage in citizen science projects? The aim of this contribution is to explore the social mechanisms that push nonexperts (i.e., citizens) to invest energy, time, and (sometimes) money in collaborative initiatives on the ground of scientific research. Some relevant examples from the domain of community-based rain measuring are scrutinized, merging the views of a water scientist and a social scientist. After briefly discussing the limits of outdated approaches to science-technology-society issues, social identity theory and new media mechanisms are analyzed as key variables to understand what is new in today's science coming across citizenship. A discussion on the importance of accounting for the uncertainty inherent with the observations coming from crowdsourcing initiatives, possibly the most challenging side effect of what we call Citizen Science 2.0, closes the paper.

TI A two-state integral-balance model for soil moisture and groundwater
   dynamics in complex terrain
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A dynamical model is devised for a hydrologic system where unsaturated and saturated storage serve as the principal control on rainfall-runoff and where complex topography, drainage area, and variable depth of moisture penetration describe the flow geometry, The model is formed by direct integration of the local conservation equation with respect to the partial volumes occupied by unsaturated and saturated moisture storage, respectively. This yields an ''integral-balance'' model in just two state variables. The relationship of the dynamical model to field data in complex terrain is found through a joint probability density for terrain features. This serves as a ''volume'' weighting function to construct conditional averages for the state variables and fluxes over a specified range of terrain features. The scale of averaging could range from hillslopes to river basins. Two examples of the joint probability of terrain features (altitude and aspect) are demonstrated for Valley, Ridge, and Appalachian Plateau digital elevation models. The strategy of a dynamical model formed by conditional averages of state variables with respect to terrain features is proposed as a way of simplifying the dynamics while preserving the natural spatial and temporal scales contributing to runoff response. The parametric form of the storage-flux or constitutive relationships for the proposed model is determined from numerical experiments in a simple hillslope flow geometry. The results show that a competitive relation exists between unsaturated and saturated storage except for the lowest precipitation rates. Saturation overland flow is proposed to be a storage-feedback relation. Solutions to the integral-balance model are presented in terms of the phase portrait, which represents all possible solution trajectories in state-space. The timing and magnitude of peaks in the runoff hydrograph from pulse-type input events demonstrate quick flow from near-stream saturated storage, saturation overland flow including rejected rainfall (storage-feedback), and late-time infiltration from upslope subsurface flow.

AB Parameterization of subgrid-scale variability in snow accumulation and melt is important for improvements in distributed snowmelt modelling. We have taken the approach of using depletion curves that relate fractional snow-covered area to element-average snow water equivalent to parameterize the effect of snowpack heterogeneity within a physically based mass and energy balance snowpack model. Comparisons of parameterization outputs with distributed model outputs and observations show performance comparable to the distributed model and reasonable performance relative to observations for time series modelling of snow water equivalent and snow-covered area. Examination of the relationship between the shapes of the depletion curves and parametric distributions shows that the shapes of dimensionless depletion curves depend primarily on the coefficient of variation and to a lesser extent on the shape of the snow distribution function. The methods presented here are a generalization of several previously used methods to estimate depletion curve shapes. Comparison of several years of observed depletion curves from the study basin show that the shapes of the depletion curves change little from year to year. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Secondary motions are commonly present in open channel flows. This study aims to investigate, both experimentally and analytically, time-mean characteristics of cellular secondary flows generated by longitudinal bedforms. Experiments were conducted in a tilting, rectangular flume with six different longitudinal bedforms, including alternate bed strips with different roughness heights and bed ridges of wavy and rectangular shapes. Various flows were sampled using a two-dimensional laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) and a one-dimensional ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter (UDV). Experimental results demonstrate secondary flows appearing basically in cellular fashion over the modeled longitudinal bedforms. It is also shown that the cellular structures can be described analytically with kinematic considerations. The discrepancies between theoretical and measurement results are discussed. An empirical relationship between maximum vertical velocity and bed configuration is finally proposed based on the experimental data. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB [ 1] A mathematical model, based on the kinematic wave (KW) theory, is developed for describing the evolution and movement of bed profiles in alluvial channels. The model employs a functional relation between sediment transport rate and concentration, a relation between flow velocity and depth and Velikanov's formula relating suspended sediment concentration to flow variables. Laboratory flume and field data are used to test the model. Transient bed profiles in alluvial channels are also simulated for several hypothetical cases involving different water flow and sediment concentration characteristics. The model-simulated bed profiles are found to be in good agreement with what is observed in the laboratory, and they seem theoretically reasonable for hypothetical cases. The model results reveal that the mean particle velocity and maximum concentration ( maximum bed form elevation) strongly affect transient bed profiles.

AB A limitation of existing models of water and solute movement in fen peats is that they fail to represent processes in the unsaturated zone. This limitation is largely due to a lack of data on the hydraulic properties of unsaturated peat, in particular the relationship between hydraulic conductivity (K) and pressure head (psi). A tension infiltrometer was used to measure K(psi) of a fen peat in Somerset, England. It was found that macropores could be important in water and solute movement in this soil type. It was also found that (i) variability of K in this peat was less than that reported for other peats and mineral soils, and (ii) the K data were better described by a log-normal distribution than a normal distribution in accord with findings from other peat and mineral soils. Recommendations on improving the understanding of water and solute movement in the unsaturated zone of this soil type are made. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

AB Hydrologic signatures are quantitative metrics or indices that describe statistical or dynamical properties of hydrologic data series, primarily streamflow. Hydrologic signatures were first used in eco-hydrology to assess alterations in flow regime, and have since seen wide uptake across a variety of hydrological fields. Their applications include extracting biologically relevant attributes of streamflow data, monitoring hydrologic change, analyzing runoff generation processes, defining similarity between watersheds, and calibrating and evaluating hydrologic models. Hydrologic signatures allow us to extract meaningful information about watershed processes from streamflow series, and are therefore seeing increasing use in emerging information-rich areas such as global-scale hydrologic modeling, machine learning, and large-sample hydrology. This overview paper describes the background and development of hydrologic signature theory, reviews hydrologic signature use across a variety of applications, and discusses ongoing hydrologic signature research including current challenges.

AB Steady state nonuniform flow in a heterogeneous medium is investigated using a combined numerical-empirical approach.  The objective of the study is to determine the effective transmissivity of a square field with a constant-head external boundary and a constant-rate well at its center.  Transmissivity at the point scale is modeled as an isotropic and multivariate lognormal spatial random function.  Block transmissivities are defined using an empirical scaling up of point support values within the field.  The scaling process is a weighted spatial geometric averaging where log transmissivities are weighted by the inverse square of their distance from the well.  Block transmissivities thus obtained and true effective values calculated using a numerical flow model are compared for realizations a finely discretized transmissivity field.  The principal finding of this study is that effective transmissivities obtained from the numerical flow model and block values obtained by spatial averaging are in excellent agreement for low to moderate variances of log transmissivity and moderately eccentric field geometries.  The geostatistical model for point scale transmissivity and the deterministic spatial averaging law are combined in order to create a geostatistical model for transmissivity at the block scale.  Exact expressions are derived for the ensemble moments of block-averaged transmissivities and well drawdowns in both the nonconditional case and the conditional case when transmissivity at the well bore is known.  The ensemble mean of block-averaged transmissivity is found to decrease from the ensemble arithmetic mean toward the ensemble geometric mean as the field size becomes large compared to the integral range of spatial correlation.  This result contradicts earlier published work.  Numerical results presented in this study also disagree with the analytical results of a recent stochastic analysis of specific discharge in radial systems.

AB Methodologies are presented to (1) evaluate the effect of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) motion on velocity measurements, (2) assess the stationarity of velocity time series, and (3) ensure that a sample record is of sufficient length for measurements taken with an ADCP at a fixed location in a natural river. ADCP motion occurring on the timescale of an ensemble is investigated by comparing single-ping and multiping measurements obtained at the same location under the same flow conditions. Large-scale motion occurring over the course of the entire measurement is studied by first examining a set of indicators to determine if motion may have resulted in the ADCP measuring in regions of different flow characteristics and then dividing the record into segments representing the potentially different regions for comparison. If boat motion is significant, the ADCP record is edited accordingly. Stationarity is assessed using statistical trend tests with guidance provided for selecting parameters based on instrument physics and flow conditions. Mean streamwise and spanwise velocity profiles can be calculated after confirming the reliability of a measurement. A set of criteria are presented to evaluate the appropriateness of an assumption of the law of the wall for streamwise velocity profiles. The methodology is demonstrated using 67 fixed-vessel measurements obtained at two sites on the lower Roanoke River for two discharges. The results indicate that an appropriate procedure was used for securing the ADCP in the channel and that the sample records were sufficient to provide both accurate measurements of mean quantities and assess the stationarity of velocity.

AB A stochastic model for the evolution of DO and BOD components along a river with independent BOD point inputs has been developed. The model examines the case in which the initial conditions and the concentrations of the inputs are affected by uncertainty. The uncertain quantities are modelled as random variables, for which any kind of probability distribution can be adopted. The possibility of separately analysing the different components of BOD (e.g., CBOD and NBOD) is included. A semi-analytical expression for the joint probability density function (pdf) of the concentrations is derived. The application of this relationship greatly reduces the computation efforts compared to Monte-Carlo methods. A procedure for the analytical determination of the concentration moments is also described. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GAUGE
AB Automatic precipitation gauges tend to underestimate solid precipitation in the presence of wind. Loss as a function of wind speed is typically evaluated by comparing the gauge with it more accurate measurement made using a double-fence intercomparison reference gauge (DFIR). For small precipitation events, small errors in the observations can induce large errors in the 'catch' ratio, i.e. the ratio of the automatic gauge measurement to the DFIR observation. For this reason, precipitation events of less than 3 mm are typically discarded before performing the regression analysis. This can mean discarding more than 90% of the observations. This paper shows how the method of weighted least squares call be used to perform a regression analysis that can take into account the whole sample to provide a more accurate estimation of the relationship between the catch ratio and the wind speed. This methodology is then used to obtain an adjustment curve for it shielded Geonor T-200B precipitation gaauge in Northern Quebec.

AB Two cases are considered: (a) circular channel with constant Manning roughness coefficient, and (b) circular channel with variable Manning roughness coefficient. For case (b), a mathematical equation, which can describe the variation of Manning roughness coefficient with flow depth is presented. The examination of the "old" kinematic wave parameters shows that they do not give good agreement to the "true" relationships between discharge and flow area. "New" kinematic wave parameters that give better agreements are recommended to replace the old parameters. Similarly, the time of travel formulas that are based on the new parameters are recommended to replace the formulas that are based on the old parameters. These time of travel formulas can be used for estimating the time of travel in circular channel subject to a uniform lateral inflow and a constant upstream inflow. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The causes of natural variability in catchment scale N export need to be understood and quantified before the effects of increased N deposition in high elevation catchments can be evaluated. This study evaluates controls on the size of the leachable soil N pool concurrent with the spring hydrologic flush that is primarily responsible for the transport of N to surface water. In high elevation catchments in the western United States, sources of N during this snowmelt flush include both atmospheric N deposition stored in the snowpack until melt and mobile soil N pools, and sinks are dominated by biogeochemical processes that occur in soil under snow cover. Because soil processes may serve either as a source or sink for N, controls on the amount of inorganic N leached from soil during the snowmelt period were evaluated in the major landscape types in four catchments in Colorado. Measurements of leached N were inversely related to measurements of over-winter CO2 flux at all sites, indicating that N was immobilized in soil heterotrophic biomass. Because over-winter soil heterotrophic activity is controlled primarily by the depth and timing of snow accumulation, the importance of these plot scale measurements to catchment scale N export were evaluated using a long-term record of winter precipitation, N deposition, and N export from Loch Vale in Rocky Mountain National Park. This data set identified a strong, linear relationship (r(2) = 0.68) between catchment scale N retention and winter snow cover, consistent with subnivean, soil based controls on the mobile N pool identified at the plot scale. These results indicate that the winter snow pack is the major control both on hydrologic N export and on soil source/sink relationships for N concurrent with this transport mechanism. The effect of winter snow cover on the fate of both atmospheric and soil N needs to be considered when evaluating potential the effects of increased N deposition on either terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems in seasonally snow-covered watersheds. In these systems, changes in surface water chemistry are likely to occur in high deposition, snow-covered sites during low snow years before terrestrial vegetation is affected.

AB The fractal dimension of an individual flee is a measure of the complexity of its external shape. Fractal dimensions can also be used to characterize flee populations, in which case the fractal dimension indicates how the shape of the smaller flocs relates to that of the larger flocs. The objective of this study is to compare the fractal dimensions of flee populations with those of individual flocs, and to evaluate how well both indicate contributions of sediment sources and reflect the nature and extent of flocculation in streams.
   Suspended solids were collected prior to and during snowmelt at upstream and downstream sites in two southern Ontario streams with contrasting riparian zones. An image analysis system was used to determine area, longest axis and perimeter of flocs. The area-perimeter relationship was used to calculate the fractal dimension, D-i, that characterizes the flee population. For each sample, the fractal dimension, D-i, of the 28 to 30 largest individual Aocs was determined from the perimeter-step-length relationship. Prior to snowmelt, the mean value of D-i ranged from 1.19 (Cedar Creek, downstream) to 1.22 (Strawberry Creek, upstream and downstream). A comparison of the means using t-tests indicates that most samples on this day had comparable mean values of D-i. During snowmelt, there was no significant change in the mean value of Di at the Cedar Creek sites. In contrast, for Strawberry Creek the mean value of D-i at both sites increased significantly, from 1.22 prior to snowmelt to 1.34 during snowmelt. This increase reflects the contribution of sediment-laden overland flow to the sediment load. At three of the sampling sites, the increase in fractal dimensions was accompanied by a decreases in effective particle size, which can be explained by an increase in bed shear stress. A comparison of fractal dimensions of individual flocs in a sample with the fractal dimensions of the floc populations indicates that both fractal dimensions provide similar information about the temporal changes in sediment source contributions, about the contrasting effectiveness of the riparian buffer zones in the two basins, and about the hydraulic conditions in the streams. Nevertheless, determining the individual fractal dimensions of a set of large flocs in a sample is very time consuming. Using fractal dimensions of flee populations is therefore the preferred method to characterize suspended matter. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In recent years, there has been increased interest in carbon cycling in natural systems due to its role in a changing climate. Northern latitude systems are especially important as they may serve as a potentially large source or sink of terrestrial carbon. There are, however, a limited number of investigations reporting on actual flux rates of carbon moving from the subsurface landscape to surface water systems in northern latitudes. In this study, we determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes from the subsurface landscape for a sub-arctic catchment located in northern Sweden. These are based on observed annual flux-averaged concentrations of DOC and DIC for the 566 km(2) Abiskojokken catchment. We demonstrate the importance to correctly represent the spatial distribution of the advective solute travel times along the various flow and transport pathways. The fluxes of DOC and DIC from the subsurface landscape to the surface water system were comparable in magnitude. This balance could shift under future climatic changes that influence the hydrological and biogeochemical system.

AB The identification of rainfall-runoff models requires selection of appropriate data for model calibration. Traditionally, hydrologists use rules of thumb to select a certain period of hydrological data to calibrate the models (i.e., 6 year data). There are no numerical indices to help hydrologists to quantitatively select the calibration data. There are two questions: how long should the calibration data be (e. g., 6 months), and from which period should the data be selected (e.g., which 6 month data should be selected)? In this study, some indices for the selection of calibration data with adequate lengths and appropriate durations are proposed by examining the spectral properties of data sequences before the calibration work. With the validation data determined beforehand, we assume that the more similarity the calibration data set bears to the validation set, the better should the performance of the rainfall-runoff model be after calibration. Three approaches are applied to reveal the similarity between the validation and calibration data sets: flow-duration curve, Fourier transform, and wavelet analysis. Data sets used for calibration are generated by designing three scenario groups with fixed lengths of 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively, from 8 year continuous observations in the Brue catchment of the United Kingdom. Scenarios in each group have different starting times and thus various durations with specific hydrological characteristics. With a predetermined 18 month validation set and the rainfall-runoff model chosen to be the probability distributed model, useful indices are produced for certain scenario groups by all three approaches. The information cost function, an entropy-like function based on the decomposition results of the discrete wavelet transform, is found to be the most effective index for the calibration data selection. The study demonstrates that the information content of the calibration data is more important than the data length; thus 6 month data may provide more useful information than longer data series. This is important for hydrological modelers since shorter and more useful data help hydrologists to build models more efficiently and effectively. The idea presented in this paper has also shown potential in enhancing the efficiency of calibration data utilization, especially for data-limited catchments.

AB Causes of recent salinization of numerous plots in the Yizre'el Valley of Israel were examined through a detailed field study of two severely affected sites. In particular, the theory of artesian influence on salt build-up in the upper cultivated soil layer was investigated. Two piezometer nests and 12 wells were installed to study the subsurface hydraulic regime. Water samples and soil extracts were taken to characterize the chemical composition down to 10 m. No significant head differences were measured at the lower site, while at the upper site 96 per cent of the head that existed at the deep (7.5 m) artesian layer was dissipated within the overlying thick clay layer. Slight head differences were noted in the shallow layers. The deep-lying, coarse-textured aquifer differs markedly from the upper confining layers and constitutes an independent water body that has little relevance to surface processes. Chemical and hydrological analyses indicate that applied low-quality irrigation waters may be the primary cause of downward-moving salinity and alkalinity which, in turn, affect soil permeability and site productivity.

AB High linear correlation between concurrent measurements of net all-wave radiation Q*, and global incoming short-wave radiation E-g(down arrow) was found for hourly, daytime and 24-h totals measured over a grassland catchment in the subhumid climate region of southeastern Australia. Five years of daily measurements were used to study the temporal variability in the fraction of incoming short-wave radiation retained at the surface as net all-wave radiation. When values of zeta = Sigma Q*/Sigma E-g(down arrow) are calculated from 24-h totals and are plotted against date, the results reveal strong day-to-day and seasonal variability in zeta. Analysis indicated that the zeta ratio was largely determined by data, latitude and cloudiness, whilst the nature of the underlying surface appeared to play a less important role. Data from four other grassland sites in Australia, New Caledonia, Denmark and Ireland yielded a general relationship for estimating zeta from day length. Values of Sigma Q* may thus be obtained from Sigma E-g(down arrow) observations using (a) a single regression between Sigma Q* and Sigma E-g(down arrow); (b) monthly zeta values derived from measurements; or (c) monthly zeta values estimated from day length. All three approaches give estimates of Sigma Q* with error terms similar to those of measurements of net an-wave radiation and those found when Sigma Q* was estimated climatologically from the individual elements of the surface radiation balance-the standard method of obtaining this rarely measured bur hydrologically important parameter. The hydrological impact of different methods of obtaining Sigma Q* was demonstrated using the semi-distributed VIC catchment model to compute potential evapotranspiration for the 26 km(2) Lockyersleigh catchment near Goulbum, New South Wales, Australia. The limited hydrological impact found is attributed to the fact that actual evapotranspiration in this subhumid catchment is limited by the strength of the soil water source rather than that of the atmospheric sink-potential evapotranspiration.

AB [1] The regional variability of shape parameters (such as k for the GEV distribution) may be described by generalized least squares (GLS) regression models that allow shape parameters to be estimated from basin characteristics recognizing the sampling uncertainty in available shape estimators. Implementation of such GLS models requires estimates of the cross-site correlation of the shape parameter estimators for every pair of sites. Monte Carlo experiments provided the information needed to identify simple power approximations of the relationships between the cross correlation of estimators of skewness gamma from [log] Pearson type 3 (P3) data and of the shape parameter k of both generalized Pareto (GP) and generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions, as functions of the intersite correlation of concurrent flows.

AB We used X-ray difference microtomography (XDMT) and multi-scale lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulations to investigate the deposition of colloidal particles in a streambed from the micron scale to the bedform scale. Flume experiments were performed to deposit zirconia colloids from suspension into a sediment bed composed of glass beads and covered with dune-shaped bedforms. Following deposition, we extracted a series of cores over a single bedform, and analyzed the microstructure of colloid deposition patterns within these cores by XDMT. Colloids deposited primarily on the upstream sides of glass beads located at the upstream face of the bedform. Colloid deposits were also found in narrow pores and grain contacts, resulting from physical straining. We used the pore structure measured by XDMT as internal solid boundaries in pore-scale LB simulations of pore water flow in order to define a constitutive porosity-permeability relationship at the scale of the representative elementary volume (REV) for the porous medium. We then incorporated this information in a continuum-scale LB model to simulate hyporheic exchange flow at the bedform scale. The bedform-scale flow model was discretized at the REV scale, with the porosity-permeability relationship obtained from the pore-scale analysis used to represent the effects of micro-scale feedbacks between particle deposition, bed structure, and pore fluid flow. Colloids deposited rapidly in the subsurface, leading to a decrease in permeability and a modification of hyporheic flow paths near the bed surface. Colloid deposition reduced the mean stream-subsurface exchange flux, but increased the spatial variability in pore water flow, leading to higher exchange flux in some locations. Similarly, the mean hyporheic residence time increased after deposition, but the development of preferential flow paths led to more rapid exchange through some regions of the bedform. These results reveal how flow-boundary interactions, colloid influx to the streambed, and colloid filtration in pore spaces interact to produce structural heterogeneity in sediment beds.

AB [1] We studied the dissolution of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) at residual saturation in two-dimensional systems using physical and numerical experiments. In all cases, preferential dissolution pathways developed in the NAPL-contaminated regions. A permeability feedback mechanism led to the formation of centimeter-scale dissolution fingers in homogeneous porous media, while fingers up to 1 order of magnitude wider formed in media with heterogeneous distributions of intrinsic permeability k, when sigma(2) (lnk) was large. The structure of the interface between the NAPL-contaminated and NAPL-free regions was examined as dissolution progressed. In all cases the interface was a self-affine fractal. The scaling relationship of Family and Vicsek [1985] fitted the interface data from the numerical simulations reasonably well.

   MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD APPROACH INCORPORATING PRIOR INFORMATION
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS
AB In this two-part series a stochastic estimation procedure applicable to the analytic streamflow model derived in the companion is introduced. The parameter estimation problem is posed in the framework of maximum likelihood theory, where prior information about the model parameters and a suitable weighting scheme for the error terms in the estimation criterion are included. Various optimization methods are combined for parameter estimation. The issues of model and parameter identifiability, uniqueness, and stability are addressed, and strategies to mitigate identifiability problems in our modeling are discussed. The seasonal streamflow model is applied to a mountainous watershed in southern Arizona, and maximum likelihood estimates of mountain front recharge and other model and statistical parameters are obtained. The analysis of estimation errors is performed in both the eigenspace and the original space of the parameters.

TI TRANSFER-FUNCTION MODELS OF SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATION
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID NEW-ZEALAND; YIELDS; CATCHMENTS; WATERSHEDS; STREAM; LAND
AB The majority of past suspended sediment concentration modeling efforts have relied on simple regression analysis.  Problems with these models, and in particular, sediment rating curves, have been gaining attention recently.  It is argued here that many of the problems result from the fact that simple regression models are inappropriate for modeling fluvial systems because they fail to adequately represent the dynamic nature of fluvial processes.  Transfer function models are system models which can account for the dynamic nature of fluvial systems.  Single input-single output and multiple input-single output transfer function models for daily suspended sediment concentration are developed for two drainage basins in Iowa.  Interpretation of the models with respect to hydrologic theory indicates that model form and parameter estimates can be related to drainage basin size, land use, and physiographic characteristics.

ID HYDROLOGIC SIMILARITY; RAINFALL; DISTRIBUTIONS; DERIVATION; MODEL
AB Peak discharge data from catchments in the central Appalachian region of eastern United States suggest that the coefficient of variation of annual flood peaks, CV[Q], is not constant, as implied by the index flood method but Varies with catchment size in a complex manner [Smith, 1992]. Gupta et al. [1994] have interpreted the data as indicating that for catchments smaller than a critical threshold size, CV[Q] increases with increasing catchment size, while for larger catchments CV[Q] decreases with catchment size. Our analysis of the same discharge data suggests further that the spatial heterogeneity of these flood frequency characteristics, for example, mean annual flood, E[Q], and coefficient of variation, CV[Q], between catchments in the region is also not constant but varies systematically with catchment size. The spatial heterogeneity of E[Q] appears to decrease with catchment size, while heterogeneity of CV[Q] appears to mirror the observed scaling behavior of CV[Q]. These observations have been made based on statistical analysis of empirical flood data without being underpinned by a physical theory to explain them. In this paper, motivated by these observations and by the need for a physical theory of regional flood frequency, we develop a simple derived flood frequency model. On the basis of insights provided by the model, we relate the increase of CV[Q] with catchment size for small catchments (smaller than a threshold size) to the scaling behavior of the ratio of storm duration to catchment response time. On the other hand, we connect the decrease of CV[Q] with catchment size for larger catchments to the spatial scaling of rainfall (excess) intensity. Our simple model also permits us to separate the relative contributions of catchment routing response and rainfall intensity to the scaling behavior of E[Q]. Our results also lead us to hypothesize that the heterogeneity of CV[Q] between catchments is primarily due to the heterogeneity of catchment response time, while the heterogeneity of E[Q] is primarily due to the heterogeneity of runoff generation processes.

AB [1] It is proposed, on the basis of an argument of thermodynamic equilibrium, that land-atmosphere interactive processes lead to thermal and hydrologic states of the land surface that maximize evaporation in a given meteorological environment. The extremum principle leads to general equations linking surface energy fluxes to surface temperature and soil moisture. The hypothesis of maximum evaporation has been tested with data from three field experiments. We found strong evidence suggesting that evaporation is maximized and furthermore that it is determined by the state variables ( temperature, soil moisture, and sensible heat flux into the atmosphere) and relatively insensitive to water vapor pressure deficit. The theory allows an independent estimate of the coefficient in the Priestley-Taylor formula for potential evaporation, which is consistent with the widely accepted value of 1.26.

ID SIERRA-NEVADA; ION ELUTION; SNOWPACKS; RELEASE
AB Four experiments were performed to examine the relationship between the meltwater flow field and ion release from melting snow. A 0.4 m(3) volume of snow was placed in a Plexiglass box and melted from above using a heating plate. The meltwater and solute fluxes issuing from the bottom of the snow were monitored. In experiments with NaCl tracer added to the snow, the solute concentrations were generally lower in the flow fingers than in the background wetting front. Dye tracer experiments revealed contemporaneous areas of concentrated dye and dilute meltwater in flow fingers. This suggests that the meltwater in flow fingers is diluted by low concentration water from the top of the snowpack. Flow fingers contribute more meltwater flux primarily because the flow is maintained for a longer period of time than in the non-finger areas; however, the relative contribution of flow fingers to solute flux was apparently not as great as that of the background wetting front because of dilution of solute in the flow finger areas.

AB An iterative geostatistical inverse approach is developed to estimate conditional effective unsaturated hydraulic conductivity parameters, soil-water pressure head, and degree of saturation in heterogeneous vadose zones. This approach is similar to the classical cokriging technique, and it uses a linear estimator that depends On covariances and cross covariances of unsaturated hydraulic parameters, soil-water-pressure head, and degree of saturation. The linear estimator is, however, improved successively by solving the governing flow equation and by updating the residual covariance and cross-covariance functions in an iterative manner. As a result, the nonlinear relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity parameters and head is incorporated in the estimation and the estimated fields are approximate conditional means. The ability of the iterative approach is demonstrated through some numerical examples.

AB A new approximate random sampling method is described for numerical solution of the contaminant transport equation where a single uncertain parameter is present. The solution consists of the probability distribution of concentration at any point in space and time as a function of the uncertain parameter. The method is based on a limited sampling of the parameter space and subsequent interpolation of the information obtained at the sample points. This interpolation produces a complete approximation of a function that relates the random parameter and the concentration. The interpolation is performed using Hermite polynomials which require function and derivative information at each sample point. The theory is developed and an example of the computation of the distribution of concentration resulting from the distribution of a single effective conductivity is presented. Numerical results suggest that this method may be one to two orders of magnitude faster than a conventional Monte Carlo approach in solving this stochastic problem while yielding comparable accuracy.

AB The freshwater ecosystems around the world are degrading, such that maintaining environmental flowEnvironmental flow (EF): "The quantity, timing, and quality of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and well-being that depend on these ecosystems. " - Arthington et al. (2018). (EF) in river networks is critical to their preservation. The relationship between streamflow alterations (subsequent EF violationsEF violations are deviations in streamflow beyond the upper and lower boundaries of environmental flow envelopes (EFEs). The EFEs establish an envelope for acceptable EF deviations based on pre-industrial (1801-1860) stream discharge (see Sect. 2.2 for more details) ) and the freshwater biodiversity response is well established at the scale of stream reaches or small basins (& SIM;< 100 km2). However, it is unclear if this relationship is robust at larger scales, even though there are large-scale initiatives to legalize the EF requirement. Moreover, EFs have been used in assessing a planetary boundaryPlanetary boundary: planetary boundary defines biogeophysical planetary-scale boundaries for Earth system processes that, if violated, can irretrievably impair the Holocene-like stability of the Earth system. for freshwater. Therefore, this study intends to conduct an exploratory evaluation of the relationship between EF violation and freshwater biodiversity at globally aggregated scales and for freshwater ecoregions. Four EF violation indices (severity, frequency, probability of shifting to a violated state, and probability of staying violated) and seven independent freshwater biodiversity indicators (calculated from observed biota data) were used for correlation analysis. No statistically significant negative relationship between EF violation and freshwater biodiversity was found at global or ecoregion scales. These findings imply the need for a holistic bio-geo-hydro-physical approach in determining the environmental flows. While our results thus suggest that streamflow and EF may not be the only determinant of freshwater biodiversity at large scales, they do not preclude the existence of relationships at smaller scales or with more holistic EF methods (e.g., including water temperature, water quality, intermittency, connectivity, etc.) or with other biodiversity data or metrics.

AB This paper describes a method to estimate the amount of snow melt using hourly data of total snow depth and precipitation. Based on viscous compression theory and an empirical relation between compressive viscosity and density of snow, an equation was derived to compute the time variation of the thickness of a snow layer due to viscous compression. Using the equation, the present height of the previous snow surface was computed, and the depth of hourly snowfall was estimated as the difference between the present height of the previous snow surface and the measured present total snow depth. Substituting precipitation to this depth as the weight of the snow layer, the depth and weight of each hourly snow layer was estimated. Depth of snow melt was estimated by subtracting the measured thickness of snow depth reduction from the estimated thickness of snow compaction.

AB In this contribution an analytical framework is put forth for the water budget of the unsaturated zone. The most important assumptions made are (1) an instantaneous redistribution of moisture and (2) a linear relationship between evapotranspiration and relative soil saturation. For storm periods, infiltration is described using the well-known solution of Philip [1957] in conjunction with the time compression approximation. For interstorm periods a new solution is derived for the moisture depletion of a soil water reservoir that experiences simultaneous evapotranspiration and percolation. The framework compares favorably with numerical solutions of Richards' equation for a wide variety of climate conditions and soil hydraulic properties. Its simplicity and computational efficiency make the framework well suited for the analysis of the impact of spatial soil and rainfall heterogeneity; on the water budget of the unsaturated zone.

AB Several successful applications of optimal control theory (OCT) based on the Pontryagin's minimum principle have been recorded in literature. These applications were focused on optimizing the operating policy of multi-reservoir systems. In this study, the performance of OCT algorithm in designing multi-reservoir system is investigated. Three deterministic optimization models based on the OCT were developed to design the best storage strategies in a multi-reservoir system to supply water. Multi-objective programming methods were implemented in the three models in order to consider the two non-commensurate objectives of minimizing cost and water deficit. The applications of these models to a multi-reservoir system were compared to an existing dynamic programming model. The result of this study showed that in all cases, the developed OCT models presented sub-optimal solution in designing multi-reservoir systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Stochastic determination of well capture zones conditioned on regular

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID NETWORK DESIGN; POROUS-MEDIA; SIMULATION; TIME
AB A stochastic approach is adopted for characterizing the uncertainty in time-related well capture zones in heterogeneous formations. Transmissivity is modeled as a random space function, conditioned on regular grids of evenly distributed transmissivity measurements. Monte Carlo analysis is used to infer the probability distribution of the resulting stochastic capture zones. Three measures of conditioning performance are defined and evaluated for several combinations of conditioning density, transmissivity variance, and transmissivity integral scale. Furthermore, a connection is made with previous work on transport theory. Simulation results show that conditioning performance increases with an increasing conditioning density, an increasing transmissivity integral scale, and a decreasing transmissivity variance. However, there is a threshold combination of conditioning density and integral scale beyond which conditioning performance stagnates. The practical implications of the results in general and the threshold in particular are discussed.

TI TRANSACTION RISK VERSUS TRANSACTION COSTS IN WATER TRANSFERS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Transaction cost has been a frequent topic in theoretical and practical discussions of water transfers. However, the risk or probability that a transfer effort will be unsuccessful should also have a significant effect on the decision by potential water purchasers to seek water transfers in lieu of seeking water by conventional means (source capacity expansion or water conservation). The importance of the uncertainty of transfer completion is examined analytically under a decision theory framework. Some implications of uncertain transaction completion for water transfer policy are discussed. In general, seeking water transfers becomes more attractive to potential water purchasers if the probability of a successful transfer is increased, if more of the transaction costs for water transfers are incurred after a transfer has been approved, and if the costs of delaying implementation of alternative water supplies are small.

AB This work presents a two-dimensional hydraulic model that includes gates as internal structures. The flow is modeled using the two-dimensional shallow water equations and the gates are formulated as internal boundary conditions to provide a simulation tool for water flood management. When open channel flow in a river passes through a gate, the shallow water equations are no longer valid and energy conservation laws are required. The change in the set of equations is avoided by modeling gates as a spatial discontinuity or internal boundary condition, providing an alternative algorithm to the one used in the rest of the flooded computational domain. In the first part of this work, the requirements of an adequate discretization for gate modeling are provided in the context of a finite volume numerical scheme able to handle all kind of flow regimes over complex bed topography. In the second part of this work, the formulation of the internal boundary conditions is verified by means of a test case with exact solution. A benchmark test case is then proposed as a synthetic river reach with lateral storage areas controlled by gates. Dimensional analysis is used to establish the regulation parameters influencing the attenuation of the outlet peak discharge. It is also shown that the peak outflow discharge can be reduced by coupling the present simulator with a proportional-integral-derivative regulation algorithm. Finally, a river reach of the Ebro River is simulated with a real flooding scenario. Citation: Morales-Hernandez M., J. Murillo, and P.

   MODEL; ROUGHNESS; FIELDS; ERRORS; CRACKS
AB Dispersion of solutes in a variable aperture fracture results from a combination of molecular diffusion and velocity variations in both the plane of the fracture (macrodispersion) and across the fracture aperture (Taylor dispersion). We use a combination of physical experiments and computational simulations to test a theoretical model in which the effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient D-L is expressed as a sum of the contributions of these three dispersive mechanisms. The combined influence of Taylor dispersion and macrodispersion results in a nonlinear dependence of D-L on the Peclet number (Pe = Y(b)/D-m, where V is the mean solute velocity, (b) is the mean aperture, and D-m is the molecular diffusion coefficient). Three distinct dispersion regimes become evident: For small Pe (Pe much less than 1), molecular diffusion dominates resulting in D-L proportional to Pe(0); for intermediate Pe, macrodispersion dominates (D-L proportional to Pe) and for large Pe, Taylor dispersion dominates (D-L proportional to Pe(2)). The Pe range corresponding to these different regimes is controlled by the statistics of the aperture field. In particular, the upper limit of Pe corresponding to the macrodispersion regime increases as the macrodispersivity increases. Physical experiments in an analog, rough-walled fracture confirm the nonlinear Pe dependence of D-L predicted by the theoretical model. However, the theoretical model underestimates the magnitude of D-L. Computational simulations, using a particle-tracking algorithm that incorporates all three dispersive mechanisms, agree very closely with the theoretical model predictions. The close agreement between the theoretical model and computational simulations is largely because, in both cases, the Reynolds equation describes the flow field in the fracture. The discrepancy between theoretical model predictions and D-L estimated from the physical experiments appears to be largely due to deviations from the local cubic law assumed by the Reynolds equation.

AB Increasingly, ground-based and airborne geophysical data sets are used to inform groundwater models. Recent research focuses on establishing coupling relationships between geophysical and groundwater parameters. To fully exploit such information, this paper presents and compares different hydrogeophysical inversion approaches to inform a field-scale groundwater model with time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data. In a sequential hydrogeophysical inversion (SHI) a groundwater model is calibrated with geophysical data by coupling groundwater model parameters with the inverted geophysical models. We subsequently compare the SHI with a joint hydrogeophysical inversion (JHI). In the JHI, a geophysical model is simultaneously inverted with a groundwater model by coupling the groundwater and geophysical parameters to explicitly account for an established petrophysical relationship and its accuracy. Simulations for a synthetic groundwater model and TDEM data showed improved estimates for groundwater model parameters that were coupled to relatively well-resolved geophysical parameters when employing a high-quality petrophysical relationship. Compared to a SHI these improvements were insignificant and geophysical parameter estimates became slightly worse. When employing a low-quality petrophysical relationship, groundwater model parameters improved less for both the SHI and JHI, where the SHI performed relatively better. When comparing a SHI and JHI for a real-world groundwater model and ERT data, differences in parameter estimates were small. For both cases investigated in this paper, the SHI seems favorable, taking into account parameter error, data fit and the complexity of implementing a JHI in combination with its larger computational burden.

TI THE REGULATION OF GROUNDWATER QUALITY WITH DELAYED-RESPONSES

DT Article
AB This research develops a dynamic model of input regulation in the presence of externalities that do not occur simultaneously with input use. The model is formulated to study the regulation of firms that apply fertilizer, where leachate from the application of fertilizer accumulates in groundwater over time. In the model we show the derivation of an optimal nitrogen user fee and the consequences of regulatory design when time lags between nitrogen application and nitrate contamination are present. This research also responds to the need of developing a general solution algorithm for an optimal control model when the control variable exhibits a delayed response. A multistage solution algorithm presented in this paper is different from other studies in that a typical relationship is not assumed for the state and adjoint variables.

AB [1] The separation of base flow from discharge records is an important issue in hydrology. The objective of this paper is to develop a base flow separation algorithm, based on groundwater theory, in which the shape of the aquifer is taken into account and for which the parameters can be estimated from river discharge measurements. For this purpose, an analytical solution to the linearized Boussinesq equation for realistic aquifer shapes and temporally variable recharge rates is derived. This solution is combined with a mass balance at the land surface in order to construct the base flow separation algorithm. The parameters of the base flow filter are calculated on the basis of the same analytical solution. Comparison of the results of the new algorithm to existing base flow separation methods shows the need for a physical basis for base flow filters.

TI Bayesian networks modelling in support to cross-cutting analysis of

ID GOVERNANCE
AB Despite the efforts made towards the Millennium Development Goals targets during the last decade, improved access to water supply or basic sanitation still remains unavailable for millions of people across the world. This paper proposes a set of models that use 25 key variables and country profiles from the WatSan4Dev data set involving water supply and sanitation (Dondeynaz et al., 2012). This paper suggests the use of Bayesian network modelling methods because they are more easily adapted to deal with non-normal distributions, and integrate a qualitative approach for data analysis. They also offer the advantage of integrating preliminary knowledge into the probabilistic models. The statistical performance of the proposed models ranges between 20 and 5% error rates, which are very satisfactory taking into account the strong heterogeneity of variables. Probabilistic scenarios run from the models allow an assessment of the relationships between human development, external support, governance aspects, economic activities and water supply and sanitation (WSS) access.
   According to models proposed in this paper, gaining a strong poverty reduction will require the WSS access to reach 75-76% through: (1) the management of ongoing urbanisation processes to avoid slums development; and (2) the improvement of health care, for instance for children.
   Improving governance, such as institutional efficiency, capacities to make and apply rules, or control of corruption is positively associated with WSS sustainable development. The first condition for an increment of the HDP (human development and poverty) remains of course an improvement of the economic conditions with higher household incomes.
   Moreover, a significant country commitment to the environment, associated with civil society freedom of expression constitutes a favourable setting for sustainable WSS services delivery. Intensive agriculture using irrigation practises also appears as a mean for sustainable WSS thanks to multi-uses and complementarities. With a WSS sector organised at national level, irrigation practices can support the structuring and efficiency of the agriculture sector. It may then induce rural development in areas where WSS access often is set back compared to urban areas(1). External financial support, called Official Development Assistance (ODA CI), plays a role in WSS improvement but comes last in the sensitivity analyses of models.
   An overall 47% of the Official Development Assistance goes first to poor countries, and is associated to governance aspects: (1) political stability and (2) country commitment to the environment and civil society degree of freedom. These governance aspects constitute a good framework for aid implementation in recipient countries.
   Modelling is run with the five groups of countries as defined in Dondeynaz et al. (2012). Models for profile 4 (essential external support) and profile 5 (primary material consumption) are specifically detailed and analysed in this paper. For countries in profile 4, fighting against water scarcity and progressing desertification should be the priority. However, for countries in profile 5, efforts should first concentrate on consolidation of political stability while supporting diversification of the economic activities. Nevertheless, for both profiles, reduction of poverty should remain the first priority as previously indicated.

AB This study explores the use of ground penetrating radar (GPR) tomographic velocity, GPR tomographic attenuation, and seismic tomographic velocity for hydraulic conductivity estimation at the South Oyster Site, using a Bayesian framework. Since site-specific relations between hydraulic conductivity and geophysical properties are often nonlinear and subject to a large degree of uncertainty such as at this site, we developed a normal linear regression model that allows exploring these relationships systematically. Although the log-conductivity displays a small variation (sigma (2) = 0.30) and the geophysical data vary over only a small range, results indicate that the geophysical data improve the estimates of the hydraulic conductivity. The improvement is the most significant where prior information is limited. Among the geophysical data, GPR and seismic velocity are more useful than GPR attenuation.

AB Although rewetting practices have been implemented in several cutover raised bogs, their effects on discharge patterns have not received much attention. In 1983, after peat extraction had stopped in the Leegmoor, a cutover raised bog in Germany, an experimental area was set up in order to monitor rewetting and subsequent restoration. Discharge was measured since 1984. The results suggest that rewetted raised bogs may not be effective as regulators of stream flow. An increase of low flows during a decade of rewetting could partly be attributed to weather variation. A comparison of the Leegmoor with a nearby control catchment produced similar results. A shift in the relationship between discharge and groundwater level over time was recorded. This is probably a result of the development of vegetation and a corresponding reduction of the area of open water, leading to an increase of resistance to water flow. The Leegmoor data demonstrate that the daily discharge pattern is most flashy immediately after the start of rewetting and will gradually smooth. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Hydrological models simulate the land phase component of the global water cycle and provide a mechanism for evaluating the effects of climatic variation and change on water resources, Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical process within such models, This study evaluates three different methods for estimating ET in the simple lumped reservoir parametric model (SLURP), over a five-year period in the Kootenay Basin of eastern British Columbia. The three ET methods were the Morton implementation of the Bouchet complementary relationship, the Granger modification of Penman's method and the Spittlehouse energy-limited versus soil moisture-limited method. We evaluated the three ET methods indirectly, based on the ability of the SLURP hydrological model to simulate daily stream flow over several annual cycles. Although the ET methods affected simulated stream flow differently, the Spittlehouse method had more physical significance and gave better agreement between simulated and recorded stream flows. The results showed that using an ET method that included a soil moisture limitation to ET produced a worthwhile improvement in hydrological performance. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A higher-order theory is presented for steady state, mean uniform saturated flow and nonreactive solute transport in a random, statistically homogeneous natural log hydraulic conductivity field Y. General integral expressions are derived for the spatial covariance of fluid velocity to second order in the variance sigma(2) of Y in two and three dimensions. Integrals involving first-order (in sigma) fluctuations in hydraulic head are evaluated analytically for a statistically isotropic two-dimensional Y field with an exponential autocovariance, Integrals involving higher-order head fluctuations are evaluated numerically for this same field. Complete second-order results are presented graphically for sigma(2) = 1 and sigma(2) = 2. They show that terms involving higher-order head fluctuations are as important as those involving lower-order ones. The velocity variance is larger when approximated to second than to first order in sigma(2). Discrepancies between second- and first-order approximations of the velocity autocovariance diminish rapidly with separation distance and are very small beyond two integral scales. Transport requires approximation at two levels: the flow level at which velocity statistics are related to those of Y, and the advection level at which macrodispersivities are related to velocity fluctuations. Our results show that a second-order flow correction affects transport to a greater extent than does a second-order correction to advection. Asymptotically, the second-order transverse macrodispersivity tends to zero as does its first-order counterpart. An approximation of advection alone based on Corrsin's conjecture, coupled with either a first- or a second-order flow approximation, leads to a transverse macrodispersivity which is significantly larger than that obtained by standard perturbation and tends to a nonzero asymptote. Published Monte Carlo results yield macrodispersivities that lie significantly below those predicted by first- and second-order theories. Considering that Monte Carlo simulations often suffer from sampling and computational errors, that standard perturbation approximations are theoretically valid only for sigma(2) < 1, and that Corrsin's conjecture represents the leading term in a renormalization group perturbation which contains contributions from an infinite number of high-order terms, we find it difficult to tell which of these approximations is closest to representing transport in strongly heterogeneous media with sigma(2) greater than or equal to 1.

AB A range of bed-load sediment transport formulae are used to run fully coupled, morphodynamic simulations of one [1] swash cycle on an erodible plane beach. A system comprising shallow water equations and Exner equation is solved, in which sediment transport rate q is either dependent only on depth averaged velocity (u), or on u and water depth (12). The results are in agreement with equivalent uncoupled results [2] in that all sediment transport formulae considered applied to the event of [1] yield net erosion in the whole of the swash. Consistent with [3], however, full coupling yields significantly less erosion for all the q = q(u) formulae compared to the equivalent uncoupled results. It is shown that differences between uncoupled and coupled approaches (for most formulae) accumulate over the course of the swash event. The main reason for the reduced net erosion is the smaller maximum inundation. It is also shown that including a dependence on h in the bed load sediment transport formula for fully coupled simulations can result in net deposition in the upper swash.
   Bed shear stress described by a Chezy law is further included in fully coupled simulations to examine net beach change. Much reduced maximum inundation and net offshore sediment transport are predicted both for q = q(u) and q = q(h,u). It is shown that although the net sediment flux at the base of the swash under one [1] swash event is still offshore, deposition in the middle or upper swash may be predicted when bed shear stress is included, particularly when the drag coefficient in the backwash is reduced compared to that in the uprush, consistent with some in-situ measurements. The implication is that bed shear stress must be included not just to obtain correct quantitative beach change, but also to obtain correct qualitative beach behaviour. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID RIVER MEANDERS; BEND THEORY; FLOW; MODEL
AB Alternate bars are important features in alluvial channels as they determine flow and transport patterns.  They appear fundamental to selection of meander wavelengths and the geometry of bends.  Bend flow has been studied extensively:  far less study has been made of flow over alternate bars.  Field results from Solfatara Creek, a 5.2-m-wide, 0.2-0.7-m-deep gravel bed channel where flow exits an upstream bend and shoals over a bar in a straight reach, are used to examine patterns of flow and the fluid forces determining the flow field.  Large cross-sectional area changes, tied primarily to variation in depth, force large stream-wise accelerations and substantial cross-stream flow off the central bar.  The topographically driven downstream and cross-stream accelerations are sufficiently large that their influence upon the balance of forces is of the same order as the pressure gradient and the boundary shear stress.  The importance of convective accelerations in the downstream flow equation in this straight reach concurs with bend flow results, but the similar importance of convective accelerations in the cross-stream equation contrasts with results from bend flow.  While part of the difference may be attributed to the lower stage conditions herein, in the absence of significant curvature change the cross-stream force balance depends upon the flow going over and around the bar.  Local boundary shear stress estimated from the law-of-the-wall and a roughness algorithm decreases out of the upstream bend, increases over the bar top to values approaching the threshold for motion, and then decreases in deeper flow.  Strong bed surface coarsening maintains the topography in a stress field that would otherwise lead to planation of the bar top and filling of the deeper regions.

AB The relative humidity at the surface of a soil is calculated as a function of time from a realistic, exactly solvable model for unsaturated fluid flow.
   When the evaporation rate is constant, as in the atmosphere-controlled phase, the surface relative humidity suddenly drops at a particular time, even though the humidity-time function is differentiable. This sudden transition still occurs, but is smoother, when more realistic radiation-type boundary conditions are introduced and when the soil-water diffusivity approaches zero continuously at zero water content. In these cases, solutions are obtained by a numerical method of lines which has been validated against the analytically solvable model. A gradual decrease in surface water content is not inconsistent with a sharp, step-like decrease in relative humidity. This is due to the universal exponential Gibbs-Boltzmann relationship between relative humidity and soil-water potential. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present results from experiments on the migration of inorganic colloids through laboratory columns containing clean quartz sand. Particle retention on the quartz collectors was found to be substantially less in experiments using negatively charged silica (SiO2) colloids than in experiments using positively charged anatase (TiO2) or boehmite (AlOOH) colloids. Analysis of these data with respect to two different advection-dispersion models indicates that deposition of colloidal silica follows a first-order, reversible kinetics process, while deposition of both anatase and boehmite is more closely depicted by second-order kinetics. Fitted values of the rate constant used to describe particle attachment vary consistently with the mean grain size of the sand and, for anatase and boehmite, are within a factor of 2 of the values predicted on the basis of colloid filtration theory.

AB This study considers a 35-year record of streamwater nitrate concentration in a small agricultural catchment in south west England (Slapton Wood). The study revisits earlier work to assess whether upward trends have been maintained and how the controls upon streamwater concentration have been altered. The study has shown that (1) the catchment has reached a new position of equilibrium and increases in nitrate concentration have lessened; (2) the occurrence of severe drought in the record means that records of less than a decade are misleading and only long-term records can illustrate changes of state; (3) the chan,e of state observed in the catchment is illustrated in the switching of long-term memory effects from a negative to a positive annual memory and (4) several significant long-term impulsivity relationships with rainfall that become insignificant over the course of the study period. The study shows the importance of long-term records in understanding changes in state in catchments and understanding the time constants of a range of driving processes.

DE DELAYED YIELD RESPONSE; MOVING WATER-TABLE; NUMERICAL STUDIES
AB As pumping proceeds in an unconfined aquifer the water-table is lowered and slowly drains out of the initially saturated material giving a delayed yield from storage. Although considerable work has been carried out on delayed yield, a definitive solution is still lacking. The unsaturated zone was treated here as a significant factor in delayed yield analysis. The one-dimensional unsaturated flow equation was solved numerically to simulate the flow in the zone located between successive water levels in the unconfined aquifer for the case with zero flux at the upper boundary. The moisture content distribution curve was integrated numerically to determine the amount of water drained with time. The study shows that the numerical results are in close agreement with the monitored field data, which implies the important role of the unsaturated zone and the reliability of the numerical simulation in describing this physical phenomenon. The results show that the relationship between the flux and time is sensibly in exponential form, which agrees with the general applicability of Boulton's assumption.

AB Many natural physical processes allow different mathematical descriptions on different scales. The microscale description is usually based on fundamental conservation laws that form a closed system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equations (PDEs) but the numerical discretization of these equations may produce a system of ODEs with an enormous number of unknowns. Furthermore, time integration of the microscale equations usually requires time steps that are smaller than the observation time by many orders of magnitude. A direct solution of these ODEs can be extremely expensive.
   Often, we are only interested in the average behavior of the microscale system rather than the exact solution of the ODEs. Here we propose a novel dimension reduction computational closure (DRNC) method that gives an approximate solution of the ODEs and provides an accurate prediction of the average behavior. The DRNC method consists of two main elements. First, effective ODEs for evolution of average variables (e.g. average velocity, concentration and mass of a mineral precipitate) are obtained by averaging the micro-scale ODEs over the entire micro-scale domain. These effective ODEs contain non-local terms in the form of volume integrals of functions of the micro-scale variables. Second, a numerical closure is used to close the system of the effective equations. The numerical closure is achieved via short bursts of the microscale model. The DRNC method is used to simulate flow and transport with mixing controlled reactions and mineral precipitation by reducing porescale (microscale) Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion-reaction equations to ODEs for averaged velocity and concentrations. Good agreement between direct solutions of the microscale equations and DRNC solutions for different boundary conditions and Damkohler numbers confirms the accuracy and computational efficiency of DRNC method. The DRNC method significantly accelerates microscale simulations, while providing accurate approximation of the microscale solution and accurate prediction of the average behavior of the system.

AB Land surface models bear substantial biases in simulating surface water and energy budgets despite the continuous development and improvement of model parameterizations. To reduce model biases, Parr et al. (2015) proposed a method incorporating satellite-based evapotranspiration (ET) products into land surface models. Here we apply this bias correction method to the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and test its performance over the conterminous US (CONUS). We first calibrate a relationship between the observational ET from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) product and the model ET from CLM4.5, and assume that this relationship holds beyond the calibration period. During the validation or application period, a simulation using the default CLM4.5 ("CLM") is conducted first, and its output is combined with the calibrated observational-vs.-model ET relationship to derive a corrected ET; an experiment ("CLMET") is then conducted in which the model-generated ET is overwritten with the corrected ET. Using the observations of ET, runoff, and soil moisture content as benchmarks, we demonstrate that CLMET greatly improves the hydrological simulations over most of the CONUS, and the improvement is stronger in the eastern CONUS than the western CONUS and is strongest over the Southeast CONUS. For any specific region, the degree of the improvement depends on whether the relationship between observational and model ET remains time-invariant a fundamental hypothesis of the Parr et al. (2015) method) and whether water is the limiting factor in places where ET is underestimated. While the bias correction method improves hydrological estimates without improving the physical parameterization of land surface models, results from this study do provide guidance for physically based model development effort.

TI Free surface and saturated-unsaturated analyses of borehole infiltration
   tests above the water table
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Constant head borehole infiltration tests are widely used for the in situ evaluation of saturated hydraulic conductivities of unsaturated soils above the water table. The formulae employed in analysing the results of such tests disregard the fact that some of the infiltrating water may flow under unsaturated conditions. Instead, these formulae are based on various approximations of the classical free surface theory which treats the flow region as if it were fully saturated and enclosed within a distinct envelope, the so-called 'free surface'. A finite element model capable of solving free surface problems is used to examine the mathematical accuracy of the borehole infiltration formulae. The results show that in the hypothetical case where unsaturated flow does not exist, the approximate formulae are reasonably accurate within a practical range of borehole conditions. To see what happens under conditions closer to those actually encountered in the field, the effect of unsaturated flow on borehole infiltration is investigated by means of two different numerical models: a mixed explicit-implicit finite element model, and a mixed explicit-implicit integrated finite difference model. Both of these models give nearly identical results; however, the integrated finite difference model is considerably faster than the finite element model. The relatively low computational efficiency of the finite element scheme is attributed to the large number of operations required in order to re-evaluate the conductivity (stiffness) matrix at each iteration in this highly non-linear saturated-unsaturated flow problem. The saturated-unsaturated analysis demonstrates that the classical free surface approach provides a distorted picture of the flow pattern in the soil. Contrary to what one would expect on the basis of this theory, only a finite region of the soil in the immediate vicinity of the borehole is saturated, whereas a significant percentage of the flow takes place under unsaturated conditions. As a consequence of disregarding unsaturated flow, the available formulae may underestimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity of fine grained soils by a factor of two, three, or more. Our saturated-unsaturated analysis leads to an improved design of borehole infiltration tests and a more accurate method for interpreting the results of such tests. The analysis also shows how one can predict the steady state rate of infiltration from data collected during the early transient period of the test.

AB Typhoons in Korea are the major causes of natural disasters in the Korean peninsula. In this study, rainfall generated by typhoons was quantitatively analysed using various statistical methods. First, the frequency analysis of rainfall induced by typhoons was carried out to calculate the design rainfall. Second, the frequency analysis of simulated rainfall derived by nonparametric Monte Carlo simulation (NMCS) was performed to evaluate the uncertainty of rainfall caused by typhoons. Third, the regression relationship between the physical characteristic factors of typhoons and rainfall was established by locally weighted polynomial regression (LWPR), and the characteristic factors of typhoons were simulated. The simulated characteristic factors were then used to estimate rainfall and to calculate the design rainfall by typhoons. Comparative analyses of design rainfalls as estimated using various statistical methods were performed. The LWPR showed good performance in terms of reproducing typhoon characteristics. Therefore, the combined NMCS and LWPR method suggested in this study can be used as a supplementary technique for assessing extreme rainfall with climate change and reflected variability.

SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES

DE snow; glacier; dust; aggregation; albedo; snowmelt; ablation
AB Ablation processes of snow under a thin dust cover are complicated compared with those under a thick cover, mainly owing to the effects of aggregation (redistribution) of dust particles on the conditions of surface melting. Aggregation of dust particles causes the snow surface to brighten after the initial dust configuration, thus affecting the relationship between initial dust concentration and surface albedo. In order to estimate snow ablation rate under a thin dust cover, we used a composite energy balance model in which the surface albedo is taken as a measured input variable. The estimated results of snow ablation agreed reasonably well with the observation, considering the measurement errors inherited in the snow depressions. Comparison of the two cases, that is, one considering the aggregation of dust particles (observation: albedo variable) and the other without aggregation (assumption: albedo constant), showed that the ablation rates were noticeably lower on the former case. This suggests that the aggregation of dust particles induces a reduction of snow ablation. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The evaporation of a separate-phase, multicomponent liquid hydrocarbon mixture in water-wetted porous media was studied to determine the role of water in the vaporization of contaminants during soil venting. Experiments were conducted in one-dimensional (1-D) water-wetted sand columns containing liquid hydrocarbons under both through-flow and bypass-flow configurations. One-dimensional through-flow and bypass-flow multicomponent drying models were applied to predict the removal rates of the hydrocarbons, as well as the effluent gas concentrations, liquid component concentration distribution in the sand, and the position of the evaporation front. Theoretical predictions agreed well with experimental data when water was present in residual amounts. Experimental findings show that the presence of water does not influence the hydrocarbon vaporization rates in both through-flow and bypass-flow drying cases, although the bypass-flow theory predicts lower effluence in a system with high water content.

AB A mass conservative finite difference scheme to describe 2D unsaturated/saturated subsurface flow is developed. The development takes into account important findings of Celia et al. (Water Resour. Res., 26(7) (1990) 1483-96) and extends their mass conservative 1D approach to two space dimensions. Moreover, using the theory of metric coefficients, the numerical model is not restricted to cartesian coordinates but is generally formulated for arbitrary orthogonal coordinate systems, thus accounting for curved boundaries of a computational domain. For flux boundary conditions convenient formulae avoid the cumbersome use of imaginary points outside the computational domain without reducing the order of magnitude of the approximation error. A flexible iteration strategy caters, on the one hand, for accuracy and stability when simulating sharp wet fronts and, on the other hand, for an economical calculation. The model was compared with the outcome of a laboratory experiment which investigated the transient development of the infiltration pattern in initially dry sand as a result of filling a circular cavity.

AB A model to describe convective overturning of a fluid layer due to density differences is derived based on equations of Kazhikhov & Smagulov. This is related to an analogous model of a reduced system based on equations of Dario Graffi. It is shown how the Graffi equations are recovered from the Kazhikhov-Smagulov equations as a non-dimensional parameter G, the Graffi number, tends to zero. The model is analysed numerically and instability thresholds are derived. It is seen that the results are realistic for small diffusion but for relatively large diffusion the approximation of Kazhikhov and Smagulov may have to be replaced by the full non-linear version. The question of spurious eigenvalues is addressed in two versions of the Chebyshev tau method employed in the numerical solution of the instability problem. It is seen that for the Kazhikhov-Smagulov theory the question of spurious eigenvalues is a non-trivial one. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An aggregate diffusion model for soil vapor extraction is applied in this paper. The model accounts for the diffusion within water-saturated aggregates and convective diffusion in air-filled macropores. Focusing only on the dominant and measurable mechanisms, we represent the kinetic term for the gas aggregate exchange by a convolution integral. The nondimensional transport equation involves only three basic parameters: (1) Peclet number, (2) ratio of advection time to aggregate diffusion time, and (3) ratio of mass within aggregate to mass in gas. Two examples of soil vapor extraction based on the model are studied. The first problem is concerned with vapor transport in a one-dimensional column, and the theory is compared with published experiments. The second example deals with vapor extraction by a well centered at a radially symmetric contaminated zone. Effects of the physical parameters on contaminant removal are discussed.

TI NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE VEDERNIKOV NUMBER
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DIFFUSION
AB There are three characteristic speeds in open channel hydraulics:  (1) the mean flow velocity u, (2) the relative celerity of kinematic waves v, and (3) the relative celerity of dynamic waves w.  These three speeds give rise to two independent dimensionless ratios:  (1) the dimensionless relative celerity of kinematic waves c(k) = v/u, and (2) the dimensionless relative celerity of dynamic waves c(d) = w/u.  The reciprocal of c(d) is the Froude number F(r) = u/w.  The Vedernikov number is the third ratio V = v/w.  Recent developments in the linear theory of surface runoff show that the Vedernikov number has a significant role in extending the concept of hydraulic diffusivity to the realm of dynamic waves.  This new perspective makes possible the modeling of catchment dynamics using diffusion waves and including inertial effects, under a wide range of boundary friction and cross-sectional shape specifications.

AB The traditional Richards equation (RE) in combination with standard monotonic properties (constitutive relations and hysteretic equations of state) has been shown to lack critical physics required to model gravity-driven fingering (GDF). We extend the RE with an experimentally observed hold-back-pile-up (HBPU) effect not captured in the standard porous-continuum RE formulation. We postulate the HBPU effect is tied to wetting front sharpness and can be mathematically formulated in a variety of ways to include hypodiffusive, hyperbolic, and mixed spatial-temporal forms involving respectively a Laplacian, a second-order derivative in time, and a Laplacian of a first-order derivative in time of the state variables. For each, we can infer an extended flux relation comprised of the Darcy-Buckingham flux plus an additional component due to the HBPU effect. Extended flux relations that are mathematically similar to each can be found in the single-phase and multiphase flow literature, however, all with very different underlying conceptualizations of the possible physics.

AB [1] This paper examines levee-protected floodplains and economic aspects of adaptation to increasing long-term flood risk due to urbanization and climate change. The lower American River floodplain in the Sacramento, California, metropolitan area is used as an illustration to explore the course of optimal floodplain protection decisions over long periods. A dynamic programming model is developed and suggests economically desirable adaptations for floodplain levee systems given simultaneous changes in flood climate and urban land values. Economic engineering optimization analyses of several climate change and urbanization scenarios are made. Sensitivity analyses consider assumptions about future values of floodplain land and damageable property along with the discount rate. Methodological insights and policy lessons are drawn from modeling results, reflecting the joint effects and relationships that climate, economic costs, and regional economic growth can have on floodplain levee planning decisions.

AB An approach to assess estuarine environmental flow based on phytoplankton preference, including the complex relationships between hydrological modifications and ecosystem biomass, was developed in this study. We initially established a relationship between biomass requirements for primary and higher nutritional level organisms based on the ecosystem nutritional energy flow principles. Subsequently, diagnostic pigments were employed to represent phytoplankton community biomass, which indicated competition between two groups of phytoplankton in the biochemistry process. Considering empirical relationships between diagnostic pigments and critical environmental factors, biomass responses to river discharge were established by simulating distributions of critical environmental factors under action of river discharges and tide currents. Consequently, environmental flows were recommended for different fish biomass requirements. We used the Yellow River estuary as a case study; and May and June were identified as critical months for maintaining environmental flow. Temporal variation in natural river flow dynamics, which was used as a proxy for environmental flow, should be carefully examined in artificial hydrological regulation strategies, particularly during high-amplitude flood pulses, which might result in negative effects on phytoplankton groups, and subsequently higher aquatic species biomass.

AB Benefit transfer methods increasingly are being applied to value nonmarketed resources for both policy evaluation and natural resource damage litigation.  This paper illustrates the need for guidelines for deciding when benefit transfer methods can be used to value changes in environmental resources.  It begins by discussing applied economic modeling perspectives and relating them to benefit transfers as tools for evaluating policy.  It reviews the history of benefit transfers and summarizes how they are typically undertaken, including the influence of the analyst's judgments on their outcome, by comparing the development of two different analyses that use benefit transfers to consider the same issue:  estimating the benefits from limiting industrial effluents discharged into specific rivers.  It proposes an agenda for future benefit transfer research:  devising strategies for extending available benefit transfer theory, learning from existing research, and formulating transferable versus "portable" modeling strategies.

AB This paper describes the use of an X ray computerized tomography scanner for noninvasive, three-dimensional, high-resolution imaging of air distribution patterns during air sparging in water-saturated sandpacks. Experiments were performed in Plexiglas cylindrical cells using well-defined Ottawa sands. The reconstructed images provide detailed porosity and air saturation distributions previously unavailable. Two classes of behavior were observed. In high-permeability (106 darcy) uniform sandpacks a relatively few, discrete, and tortuous air pathways were formed. Steady state was rapidly attained, and the intrachannel air saturations were low (0.10). In contrast, low-permeability (3 darcy) sandpacks increased the breadth of air contact, delayed attainment of steady state, and displayed high air saturations (0.50). The concept of a hydrodynamic stagnation saturation and standard one-dimensional fractional flow theory proved useful in explaining the experiments. Numerical simulation confirms the explanations, even when capillary pressure and compressibility effects are included.

AB The probability density functions (pdf's) for the longitudinal and vertical velocities, temperature, their derivatives, and momentum and sensible heat fluxes were measured in the atmospheric surface layer for a wide range of atmospheric stability conditions. The measured pdf's for both the velocity and the temperature fluctuations are near-Gaussian and consistent with corresponding laboratory measurements for near-neutral and stable stability conditions. Hence the first- and second-order moments are sufficient to predict the heat and momentum flux pdf's. The lower-order moments can be estimated from mean meteorological conditions using surface layer similarity theory. For unstable conditions the pdf for temperature is non-Gaussian and is strongly skewed due to local convective thermal plumes. For near-neutral and stable conditions the pdf's for the velocity and temperature longitudinal gradients have long exponential tails, in agreement with findings in laboratory experiments and numerical simulations.

AB [1] Increasingly available high-resolution topographic data from remote sensing motivates the search for topographic features that predict abiotic controls on the distribution and performance of biota. We investigated the extent to which periphyton distribution and stream ecosystem metabolism in a steep upland river drainage network could be predicted from physical conditions that varied with local topography. During the summers of 2003 and 2004, we measured periphyton standing crops and gross primary production and ecosystem respiration rates along a 5 km reach of the South Fork Eel River and six of its tributaries in northern California ( 39 degrees 44 ' N, 123 degrees 39 ' W). We also measured wetted stream width ( B), cross-sectionally averaged stream velocity ( U), and streambed photosynthetically active solar radiation ( PAR) at each site to investigate the degree to which periphyton abundance and metabolism were related to these indicators, which in turn are partially predictable from models relating environmental parameters to the topographic settings. Dimensional analysis, a technique widely used in the field of fluid mechanics, was used to investigate how biotic and abiotic variables may be interconnected in stream environments. Nondimensional groups of variables were formulated on the basis of our field estimates of chosen biotic and abiotic variables. Periphyton biomass was controlled by B(9/5), exposure to light PAR(1/5), nutrient concentration N(5/6), and inverse stream depth H(-5/6) and U(-1/2). The autotrophic-heterotrophic balance, quantified by the gross primary production to ecosystem respiration rate, scaled with the stream aspect ratio(B/H)(3/5) and Peclet number Pe = (UB/u(*)H)(3/10), where u(*) is the shear stress velocity. The scaling relationships were validated against reported field measurements from other geographical areas. The results show nonlinear dependencies among periphyton biomass, stream metabolism, and abiotic variables. These nonlinear relationships point to a need for detailed quantification of biotic and abiotic variables over a range of scales.

AB In recent years, statistical theory has been used to compute the ensemble mean and variance of solute concentration in aquifer formations with second-order stationary velocity fields. The merit of accurately estimating the mean and variance of concentration, however, remains unclear without knowing the shape of the probability density function (pdf). In a setup where a conservative solute is continuously injected into a domain, the concentration is bounded between zero and the concentration value in the injected solution. At small travel distances close to the fringe of the plume, an observation point may fall into the plume or outside, so that the statistical concentration distribution clusters at the two limiting values. Obviously, this results in non-Gaussian pdf's of concentration. With increasing travel distance, the lateral plume boundaries are smoothed, resulting in increased probability of intermediate concentrations. Likewise, averaging the concentration in a larger sampling volume, as typically done in field measurements, leads to higher probabilities of intermediate concentrations. We present semianalytical results of concentration pdf's for measurements with point-like or larger support volumes based on stochastic theory applied to stationary media. To this end, we employ a reversed auxiliary transport problem, in which we use analytical expressions for first and second central spatial lateral moments with an assumed Gaussian pdf for the uncertainty of the first lateral moment and Gauss-like shapes in individual cross sections. The resulting concentration pdf can be reasonably fitted by beta distributions. The results are compared to Monte Carlo simulations of flow and steady state transport in 3-D heterogeneous domains. In both methods the shape of the concentration pdf changes with distance to the contaminant source: Near the source, the distribution is multimodal, whereas it becomes a unimodal beta distribution far away from the contaminant source. The semianalytical and empirical pdf's differ slightly, which we contribute to the numerical artifacts in the Monte Carlo simulations but also to hard assumptions made in the semianalytical approach. Our results imply that geostatistical techniques for interpolation and other statistical inferences based on Gaussian distributions, such as kriging and cokriging, may be feasible only far away from the contaminant source. For calculations near the source, the beta- like distribution of concentration should be accounted for.

ID UNITED-STATES; FLUCTUATIONS
AB We present power spectra of time-series data for tree ring width chronologies, atmospheric temperatures, river discharges and precipitation averaged over hundreds of stations worldwide. The average power spectrum S for each of these phenomena is found to have a power-law dependence on frequency with exponent -1/2: S(f) proportional to f(-1/2). An advection-diffusion model of the vertical transport of heat and water vapor in the atmosphere is presented as a first-order model of climatic and hydrological variability. The model generates variability with the observed spectrum. The model is validated with a correlation analysis of temperature and water vapor concentration measurements from the TIROS operational vertical sounder (TOVS). Drought frequency analyses based on synthetic lognormal streamflows with the above power spectrum are presented. We show that the presence of long memory as implied by the power-law power spectrum has a significant effect on the likelihood of extended droughts compared with the drought hazard implied from standard autoregressive models with short memory.

   PATTERNS; INTERPOLATION
AB Soil moisture at the catchment scale exhibits a huge spatial variability. This suggests that even a large amount of observation points would not be able to capture soil moisture variability.
   We present a measure to capture the spatial dissimilarity and its change over time. Statistical dispersion among observation points is related to their distance to describe spatial patterns. We analyzed the temporal evolution and emergence of these patterns and used the mean shift clustering algorithm to identify and analyze clusters. We found that soil moisture observations from the 19.4 km(2) Colpach catchment in Luxembourg cluster in two fundamentally different states. On the one hand, we found rainfall-driven data clusters, usually characterized by strong relationships between dispersion and distance. Their spatial extent roughly matches the average hillslope length in the study area of about 500 m. On the other hand, we found clusters covering the vegetation period. In drying and then dry soil conditions there is no particular spatial dependence in soil moisture patterns, and the values are highly similar beyond hillslope scale.
   By combining uncertainty propagation with information theory, we were able to calculate the information content of spatial similarity with respect to measurement uncertainty (when are patterns different outside of uncertainty margins?). We were able to prove that the spatial information contained in soil moisture observations is highly redundant (differences in spatial patterns over time are within the error margins). Thus, they can be compressed (all cluster members can be substituted by one representative member) to only a fragment of the original data volume without significant information loss.
   Our most interesting finding is that even a few soil moisture time series bear a considerable amount of information about dynamic changes in soil moisture. We argue that distributed soil moisture sampling reflects an organized catchment state, where soil moisture variability is not random. Thus, only a small amount of observation points is necessary to capture soil moisture dynamics.

DT Article
ID MOUNTAIN SNOWPACK; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; TRENDS
AB Our best estimates of 1 April snow water equivalent (SWE) in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State indicate a substantial (roughly 15-35%) decline from mid-century to 2006, with larger declines at low elevations and smaller declines or increases at high elevations. This range of values includes estimates from observations and hydrologic modeling, reflects a range of starting points between about 1930 and 1970 and also reflects uncertainties about sampling. The most important sampling issue springs from the fact that half the 1 April SWE in the Cascades is found below about 1240 m, altitudes at which sampling was poor before 1945. Separating the influences of temperature and precipitation on 1 April SWE in several ways, it is clear that long-term trends are dominated by trends in temperature, whereas variability in precipitation adds 'noise' to the time series. Consideration of spatial and temporal patterns of change rules out natural variations like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation as the sole cause of the decline. Regional warming has clearly played a role, but it is not yet possible to quantify how much of that regional warming is related to greenhouse gas emissions.

AB [1] The U. S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Southeast Watershed Research Laboratory (SEWRL) initiated a watershed research program at the Little River Experimental Watershed in 1967. Continuous rainfall measurement across the watershed began at that time. Forty-six precipitation gauges and three climate stations are currently in operation. Soil moisture measurements were added to 29 of the rainfall sites from 2001 to 2006. The research quantifies critical information related to long- term and seasonal climatic relationships, hydrologic budgets for the region, water quality studies, and natural resource planning. Rainfall data from the network have been used to evaluate storm characteristics, climatic patterns, and long- term averages for the region. Soil moisture data have been used to examine large- scale patterns across the region and for comparison to remotely sensed data.

AB A mathematical model for two-dimensional laminar flow over a rough surface is developed. Explicit formulae are presented for the height and average and maximum velocities in terms of measurable quantities and a friction factor. The correction factor a, the ratio of the average to maximum velocity, is also discussed and shown to vary significantly from the value on a smooth surface. Predictions for the film height and velocities are presented and compared with previous experiments. Good agreement is obtained between the theory and experiments. The saline technique for measuring velocities is shown to significantly underpredict the fluid velocity. The Manning, Chezy, and Darcy-Weisbach formulae all overpredict the velocity in the laminar flow regime. It is also shown that there is a relation between the correction factor and the height or inundation ratio, but there is no relation to the Reynolds number in laminar flow.

AB Simple models of groundwater flow have limited capability of representing spatial waterlogging/salinization due to the mismatch in scale between model cell size/process conceptualization and actual process scale. This paper presents a method for utilizing increasingly available high-resolution digital elevation data to develop a sub-grid parameterization for groundwater discharge and surface waterlogging. This enables simple groundwater models to represent the actual area of waterlogging/salinization better. The approach utilizes a 'zero-piezometric surface' (i.e. a planar surface that passes through the lowest point of each element in a groundwater model). The difference in elevation between the zero-piezometric surface and a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) provides a distribution of depth to the zero-piezometric surface (at the DEM scale) for each element in the model. Traditional methods for evaluating surface discharge can then be applied at the DEM cell scale to the distribution of depth to zero-piezometric surface to derive a relationship between depth to piezometric surface and net recharge/discharge, for each element in the model. A simple one dimensional groundwater flow model, FLOWTUBE, is used to demonstrate the approach. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Hydraulic lift is the transport of water from moist into drier soil layers through plant root systems: Plant roots sometimes do not only take up water but also release water if the soil is dry. Hydraulic lift has been shown for a relatively small number of species, but it is believed to be a more general phenomenon. We model numerically water uptake and two-dimensional water transport through the soil and through the root system as coupled processes. Both water uptake and transport through the root system are considered to be hydraulic processes; osmotic effects are neglected. The model is capable of tracing hydraulic lift; the simulated amount of shifted water is consistent with experimental data. This supports the theory that hydraulic lift is a pure hydraulic process without an osmotic component. Furthermore, we discuss how far hydraulic lift could be an optimized strategy for the plant.

AB An analysis of the Cape Cod test was performed using several first- and higher-order theoretical models. We compare conditional and unconditional solutions of the transport equation and employ them for analysis of the experimental data. We consider spatial moments, mass breakthrough curves, and the distribution of the solute mass in space. The concentration measurements were also analyzed using theoretical models for the expected value and variance of concentration. The theoretical models we employed are based on the spatial correlation structure of the conductivity held, without any fitting of parameters to the tracer data, and hence we can test the predictive power of the theories tested. The effects of recharge on macrodispersion are investigated, and it is shown that recharge provides a reasonable explanation for the enhanced lateral spread of the Cape Cod plume. The compendium of the experimental results presented here is useful for testing of theoretical and numerical models.

AB In this article a method is proposed for the efficient simulation of reactive systems or reactive transport problems including (equilibrium) mineral precipitation-dissolution. The difficulty lies in the fact that for larger systems it is usually a priorily not known for which mineral the fluid is saturated and for which it is undersaturated. Currently wide-spread algorithms use some trial-and-error strategy requiring repeated computations, or an approximation of equilibrium precipitation-dissolution by a kinetic description. In this article we propose to formulate the problem as a so-called complementarity problem (CP) and to solve it with the semismooth Newton method, a solution strategy well known in the field of optimization theory. The CP formulation of the mineral reactions is then combined with a reformulation for the full multicomponent reactive transport problem which leads to a reduction of the number of unknowns. The reactive transport problem is tackled in the sense of a one step (global implicit) method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID LAYERED SOILS; INFILTRATION; MOVEMENT; WATER
AB As water infiltrates downward into an air-filled, water wettable porous medium, the wetting front which forms may become unstable and allow the formation of downward moving fingers within the vadose zone.  In this paper we first review stability criteria and estimated finger widths determined from linear stability theory in two-dimensional systems.  Two approaches reported in the literature which employ different formulations for the interfacial boundary conditions, yield different estimates of the finger width.  We extend the analyses to investigate finger diameter in three-dimensional systems by considering axisymmetric disturbances.  Results of the three-dimensional analyses are illustrated through comparison to previously reported experimental results in three-dimensional systems.  Because either approach gives similar results for low system fluxes, in practice, it probably will not matter which formulation is used.  However, one approach represents the data better and contains only traditionally measured porous media properties.

ID UNIT-HYDROGRAPH
AB The values of the parameters of the Clark instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) are often relying on the subjective decision of the researcher, which leads to large variations of their values. Therefore, an objective method minimizing the subjective judgement in the IUH modelling procedure while providing a reduced range of acceptable values is proposed. The proposed method uses a basin average IUH to mitigate the robustness problem of the Clark IUH parameters. Using linear system theory, the z-transform is applied to the average IUH and then the IUH polynomial is factored into the recession and time-area curve (TAC) components based on a convolution relation between the Clark IUH parameters. During this calculation, the root selection method was adopted to verify the storage coefficient R from the recession component and a linear programming technique was applied for determining the TAC for the basin of interest. The Wi River basin was used to test the applicability of the proposed method. The results showed that the components of a single reservoir and the TAC for Clark IUH were separated effectively, and acceptable values for the parameters were obtained.

ID WATER-FLOW; INSITU; STATE
AB In this paper, the feasibility of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study water infiltration into a heterogeneous soil is examined, together with its difficulties and limitations. MRI studies of ponded water infiltration into an undisturbed soil core show that the combination of one- and two-dimensional imaging techniques provides a visual and non-destructive means of monitoring the temporal changes of soil water content and the moisture profile, and the movement of the wetting front. Two-dimensional images show air entrapment in repetitive ponded infiltration experiments. During the early stages of filtration, one-dimensional images of soil moisture profiles clearly indicate preferential how phenomena. The observed advance of wetting fronts can be described by a linear relationship between the square root of infiltration time (root s) and the distance of the wetting front from the soil surface. Similarly, the cumulative infiltration is also directly proportional to root t. Furthermore, from the MRI infiltration moisture profiles, it is possible to estimate the parameters that feature in infiltration equations. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper concerns recycling of the major nutrients (N, P, Ca, Mg, Na and K) by litterfall, throughfall and stemflow in a dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest and a nearby Pinus radiata plantation of similar tree density and basal area. With the exception of Mg, the concentration of these nutrients in eucalypt leaf-fall were substantially higher than in pine needlefall. The eucalypt nutrient input was greater owing to larger mass of litterfall, as well as higher concentrations. There were inverse relationships between N and P concentrations and amount of leaf-fall for the eucalypts and needlefall for the pines. Mg was positively correlated with eucalypt leaf-fall. For the other components and elements the relationships were random.
   The proportion of particular nutrients recycled by litterfall, and throughfall and stemflow, varied for both forests. For Ca, only 6 and 12%, for eucalypts and pines respectively, was recycled by throughfall and stemflow, compared with 52 and 68% of potassium. The amount of nitrogen recycled differed between the forests, in a way that was consistent with the eucalypts being native to a nitrogen-poor environment. Amounts of floor-litter collected in the eucalypt forest from two fairly distinct layers, the loose and cohesive litter, were similar. The concentrations of Mg and Na were similar in both layers, but the other elements varied substantially. The N concentration of the cohesive litter was more than double that of the loose layer, whereas its P concentration was only 10% of the loose layer value,
   Selected chemical analyses on the total tree biomass of the eucalypt forest showed that the concentration of elements increased in the order; wood, twigs, fine twigs and leaf, and from large diameter wood to fine twigs. However, the concentration in fine twig and leaf components varied between the elements. For Ca, P and K, the fine twig values were greater than the leaf values, but the reverse applied to the other elements. The concentrations of almost all elements in all components were substantially higher in Eucalyptus mannifera than in E. rossii, E. macrorhyncha and E. melliodora. The nutrient content of the floor-litter was compared with the twig, fine twig and leaf components of the live biomass, i.e. the components most likely to become readily decomposable floor-litter. For all elements except N, the amount in floor-litter was similar to the amount in the biomass components. This was because the concentration of N in the floor-litter was much greater than in these components of the biomass. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We diagnose the spatial patterns and further examine temporal behavior of anomalous monthly-seasonal precipitation, temperature, and atmospheric circulation in relationship to hydrologic (soil water and potential evapotranspiration) fluctuations at two watersheds in the central United States. The bulk hydrologic balance at each of the two watersheds, Boone River, Iowa (BN), and Bird Creek, Oklahoma (BC), was determined from the rainfall-runoff-routing watershed model described in part 1. There are many similarities among the hydroclimatic linkages at the two basins. In both, relationships with precipitation and temperature indicate that the forcing occurs on regional scales, much larger than the individual watersheds. Precipitation exhibits anomaly variability over 500-km scales, and sometimes larger. Anomalous temperature, which is strongly correlated with potential evapotranspiration, often extends from the Great Plains to the Appalachian Mountains. Seasonally, the temperature and precipitation anomalies tend to have greatest spatial coherence in fall and least in summer. The temperature and precipitation tend to have out-of-phase anomalies (e.g., warm associated with dry). Thus low soil water conditions are reinforced by low precipitation and high potential evapotranspiration, and vice versa for high soil water. Soil water anomalies in each basin accumulate over a history of significant large-scale climate forcing that usually appears one or two seasons in advance. These forcing fields are produced by atmospheric circulation anomaly patterns that often take on hemispheric scales. BN and BC have strong similarities in their monthly circulation patterns producing heavy/light monthly precipitation episodes, the primary means of forcing of the watersheds. The patterns exhibit regional high or low geopotential anomalies just upstream over the western United States or near the center of the country. The regional circulation features are often part of a train, with teleconnections upstream over the North Pacific and downstream over the North Atlantic/Eurasia sector. Synoptic scale events exhibit very similar patterns to the monthly circulations, only more intense.

AB The potential of remote sensing for providing information to hydrologists and water resources practitioners has been recognized since the 1970s. The variety of satellite and airborne platforms and the greater ease of access to imagery now make it possible to evaluate and quantify an increasingly large number of watershed physical characteristics and state variables. Canadian scientists have been very active over the last 5 years creating algorithms to extract hydrological information from remotely sensed data and to develop new, or adapt existing, hydrological methods capable of making efficient use of this new information. Over the years, research and applications of remote sensing in Canadian hydrology have embraced a variety of topics and recent research has placed significant emphasis on radar remote sensing as the Canadian RADARSAT satellite was launched successfully on 4 November 1995. This paper reviews recent (1995-99) remote sensing contributions in hydrology by Canadians, specifically focusing on the usefulness and applicability of current remote sensing technology for water management purposes. A very brief description of the theory underlying each application as well as relevant sensors is presented. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID SUBSURFACE STORM FLOW; GROUNDWATER OUTFLOW; UNIT RESPONSE; HILLSLOPE;
   DRAINAGE
AB Subsurface flow from a hillslope can be described by the hydraulic groundwater theory as formulated by the Boussinesq equation. Several attempts have been made to solve this partial differential equation, and exact solutions have been found for specific situations. In the case of a sloping aquifer, Brutsaert [1994] suggested linearizing the equation to calculate the unit response of the hillslope. In this paper we first apply the work of Brutsaert by assuming a constant recharge to the groundwater table. The solution describes the groundwater table levels and the outflow in function of time. Then, an analytical expression is derived for the steady state solution by allowing time to approach infinity. This steady state water table is used as an initial condition to derive another analytical solution of the Boussinesq equation. This can then be used in a quasi steady state approach to compute outflow under changing recharge conditions.

AB substantial interpretation of electromagnetic induction (EMI) measurements requires quantifying optimal model parameters and uncertainty of a nonlinear inverse problem. For this purpose, an adaptive Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to assess multi-orientation and multi-offset EMI measurements in an agriculture field with non-saline and saline soil. In MCMC the posterior distribution is computed using Bayes' rule. The electromagnetic forward model based on the full solution of Maxwell's equations was used to simulate the apparent electrical conductivity measured with the configurations of EMI instrument, the CMD Mini-Explorer. Uncertainty in the parameters for the three-layered earth model are investigated by using synthetic data. Our results show that in the scenario of non-saline soil, the parameters of layer thickness as compared to layers electrical conductivity are not very informative and are therefore difficult to resolve. Application of the proposed MCMC-based inversion to field measurements in a drip irrigation system demonstrates that the parameters of the model can be well estimated for the saline soil as compared to the non-saline soil, and provides useful insight about parameter uncertainty for the assessment of the model outputs.

ID WELL; AQUIFER; MODEL
AB Axisymmetric flow to a well is an important topic of groundwater hydraulics, the simulation of which depends on accurate computation of head gradients. Groundwater numerical models with conventional rectilinear grid geometry such as MODFLOW (in contrast to analytical models) generally have not been used to simulate aquifer test results at a pumping well because they are not designed or expected to closely simulate the head gradient near the well. A scaling method is proposed based on mapping the governing flow equation from cylindrical to Cartesian coordinates, and vice versa. A set of relationships and scales is derived to implement the conversion. The proposed scaling method is then embedded in MODFLOW 2000. To verify the accuracy of the method steady and unsteady flows in confined and unconfined aquifers with fully or partially penetrating pumping wells are simulated and compared with the corresponding analytical solutions. In all cases a high degree of accuracy is achieved. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Concession length and investment timing flexibility
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID VALUATION; OPTIONS
AB When assigning a concession contract, the regulator faces the issue of setting the concession length. Another key issue is whether or not the concessionaire should be allowed to set the timing of new investments. In this paper we investigate the impact of concession length and investment timing flexibility on the "concession value." It is generally argued that long-term contracts are privately valuable as they enable a concessionaire to increase its overall discounted returns. Moreover, the real option theory suggests that investment flexibility has an intrinsic value, as it allows concessionaires to avoid costly errors. By combining these two conventional wisdoms one may argue that long-term contracts, which allow for investment timing flexibility, should always result in higher concession values. Our result suggests that this is not always the case; that is, investment flexibility and long-term contracts do not necessarily increase the concession value.

ID RADIONUCLIDE TRANSPORT; MASS-TRANSPORT; ROCK; MEDIA; FLOW
AB [1] Fractures often represent the primary transport pathways within low- permeability rock. Continuum models based on the advective- dispersion equation have difficulty representing the complex transport phenomenology observed in field studies. Discrete fracture network models can represent a greater range of transport behavior at the price of being computationally intensive, which restricts their application to small rock volumes. The linear Boltzmann transport equation from the kinetic theory of gases includes additional dependencies on the particle speed and direction of travel and can thus represent a greater range of transport behavior compared with the advective- dispersion equation. The capability of the Boltzmann equation for modeling more complex transport behaviors of conservative tracers was evaluated. Parameters appearing in the Boltzmann equation were calibrated using small- scale discrete fracture networks. The calibrated Boltzmann model can simulate at spatial/ temporal scales that would be prohibitively expensive with a discrete fracture network. This hybrid approach successfully reproduced the results of discrete fracture network simulations in two dimensions.

AB One of the most important parameters for spring runoff forecasting is the snow water equivalent on the watershed, often estimated by kriging using in situ measurements, and in some cases by remote sensing. It is known that kriging technique,; provide little information on uncertainty, aside from the kriging variance. In this paper, two approaches using Bayesian hierarchical modelling are compared with ordinary kriging; Bayesian hierarchical modelling is a flexible and general statistical approach that uses observations and prior knowledge to make inferences on both unobserved data (snow water equivalent on the watershed where there is no measurements) and on the parameters (influence of the covariables, spatial interactions between the values of the process at various sites). The first approach models snow water equivalent as a Gaussian spatial process, for which the mean varies in space, and the other uses the theory of Markov random fields. Although kriging and the Bayesian models give similar point estimates, the latter provide more information on the distribution of the snow water equivalent. Furthermore, kriging may considerably underestimate interpolation error. Copyright (c) 2006 Environment Canada. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Wellhead protection is of critical importance for managing groundwater resources. While a number of previous authors have addressed questions related to uncertainties in advective capture zones, methods for addressing wellhead protection in the presence of uncertainty in the chemistry of groundwater contaminants, the relationship between land-use and contaminant sources, and the impact on health of the receiving population are limited. It is herein suggested that probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) combined with fault trees (FT) provides a structure whereby chemical transport can be combined with uncertainties in source, chemistry, and health impact to assess the probability of negative health outcomes in the population. As such, PRA-FT provides a new strategy for the identification of areas of probabilistically high human health risk. Application of this approach is demonstrated through a simplified case study involving flow to a well in an unconfined aquifer with heterogeneity in aquifer properties and contaminant sources.

AB In the winter-wet, summer-dry forests of the western United States, total annual evapotranspiration (ET) varies with precipitation and temperature. Geologically mediated drainage and storage properties, however, may strongly influence these relationships between climate and ET. We use a physically based process model to evaluate how plant accessible water storage capacity (AWC) and rates of drainage influence model estimates of ET-climate relationships for three snow-dominated, mountainous catchments with differing precipitation regimes. Model estimates show that total annual precipitation is a primary control on inter-annual variation in ET across all catchments and that the timing of recharge is a second-order control. Low AWC, however, increases the sensitivity of annual ET to these climate drivers by 3 to 5 times in our two study basins with drier summers. ET-climate relationships in our Colorado basin receiving summer precipitation are more stable across subsurface drainage and storage characteristics. Climate driver-ET relationships are most sensitive to subsurface storage (AWC) and drainage parameters related to lateral redistribution in the relatively dry Sierra site that receives little summer precipitation. Our results demonstrate that uncertainty in geophysically mediated storage and drainage properties can strongly influence model estimates of watershed-scale ET responses to climate variation and climate change. This sensitivity to uncertainty in geophysical properties is particularly true for sites receiving little summer precipitation. A parallel interpretation of this parameter sensitivity is that spatial variation in storage and drainage properties are likely to lead to substantial within-watershed plot-scale differences in forest water use and drought stress.

AB An inconsistent relationship between precipitation and runoff has been observed between drought and non-drought periods, with less runoff usually observed during droughts than would be expected based solely on precipitation deficit. Predictability of these shifts in the precipitation-runoff relationship is still challenging, largely because the underlying hydrologic mechanisms are poorly constrained. Using 30 years of data for 14 basins in California, we show how the Budyko framework can be leveraged to decompose shifts in precipitation versus runoff during droughts into "regime" shifts, which result from changes in the aridity index along the same Budyko curve, and "partitioning shifts", which imply a change in the Budyko parameter omega and thus in the relationship among water balance components that governs partitioning of available water. Regime shifts are primarily due to measurable interannual changes in precipitation or temperature, making them predictable based on drought conditions. Partitioning shifts involve further nonlinear and indirect catchment feedbacks to drought conditions and are thus harder to predict a priori. We show that regime shifts dominate changes in absolute runoff during droughts but that gains or losses due to partitioning shifts are still significant. Low aridity, high baseflow, a shift from snow to rain, and resilience of high-elevation runoff correlate with higher annual runoff during droughts than would be predicted by the precipitation-runoff ratio during non-drought years. Differentiating between these shifts in the precipitation-runoff relationship using a Budyko approach will help water resource managers, particularly in arid, drought-prone regions, to better project runoff magnitudes during droughts based on available climate data and, furthermore, understand under what circumstances and to what extent their forecasts may be less reliable due to nonlinear basin-climate feedbacks.

AB The assumption of local mass equilibrium for describing the transport of a contaminant in an aquifer containing a trapped non-aqueous-phase liquid has been under investigation for the past decade. Laboratory and field studies have shown that this assumption fails under certain circumstances, and heuristic macroscopic models have been introduced to describe the dispersion process when the assumption of local mass equilibrium is removed from the analysis. In this paper, a macroscopic model is developed for homogeneous porous media using the method of local volume averaging. The resulting macroscopic equation involves a dispersion tenser that is influenced by the mass transfer process, additional convective transport terms, and a linear form for the interfacial mass flux. Two local closure problems are provided that allow one to compute the effective transport coefficients so that theory and experiment can be compared in the absence of adjustable parameters. Numerical methods are used to solve the two local closure problems, and preliminary results are presented for two-dimensional, spatially periodic models of porous media.

AB Hydrograph recession during dry periods has been used to construct water storage-discharge relationships and to quantify storage dynamics and evaporation when streamflow data is available. However, variable hydrologic connectivity among hillslope-riparian-stream zones may affect the lumped storage-discharge relationship, and as a result, affect the estimation of evaporation and storage change. Given observations of rainfall and runoff, and remote-sensing-based observations of evaporation, the ratio (alpha) between estimated daily evaporation from recession analysis and observed evaporation, and the ratio (beta) between estimated contributing storage and total watershed storage are computed for 9 watersheds located in different climate regions. Both evaporation and storage change estimation from recession analysis are underestimated due to the effect of partial contributing storage, particularly when the discharge is low. It was found that the values of beta decrease significantly during individual recession events, while the values of beta are relatively stable during a recession event. The values of beta are negatively correlated with the water table depth and vary significantly among recession events. The partial contributing storage effect is one possible cause for the multi-valued storage-discharge relationship.

AB Flood waves resulting from flash floods and natural dam overtopping have been responsible for numerous losses. In the present study, surging waters down a flat stepped waterway (theta = 3.4degrees) were investigated in a 24 m long chute. Wave front propagation data were successfully compared with Hunt's [1982, 1984] theory. Visual observations highlighted strong aeration of the leading edge. Instantaneous distributions of void fractions showed a marked change in shape for (t - t(s))* rootg/d(o) similar to1.3, which may be caused by some major differences between the wave leading edge and the flow behind, including nonhydrostatic pressure distributions, plug-slug flow regime, and different boundary friction regime. Practically, the results quantified the large amount of entrained air (i.e., "white waters") at the wave front, which in turn, reduces buoyancy and could affect sediment motion at the leading edge because the sediment relative density is inversely proportional to the entrained air content.

AB Transient, perched water tables in the shallow subsurface are observed at the South Fork Brokenback Run catchment in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. Crest piezometers installed along a hillslope transect show that the development of saturated conditions in the upper 1.5 m of the subsurface is controlled by total precipitation and antecedent conditions, not precipitation intensity, although soil heterogeneities strongly influence local response. The macroporous subsurface storm flow zone provides a hydrological pathway for rapid runoff generation apart from the underlying groundwater zone, a conceptualization supported by the two-storage system exhibited by hydrograph recession analysis. A modified version of TOPMODEL is used to simulate the observed catchment dynamics. In this model, generalized topographic index theory is applied to the subsurface storm flow zone to account for logarithmic storm flow recessions, indicative of linearly decreasing transmissivity with depth. Vertical drainage to the groundwater zone is required, and both subsurface reservoirs are considered to contribute to surface saturation.

AB Taiwan suffers from heavy storm rainfall during the typhoon season. This usually causes large river runoff, overland flow. erosion. landslides. debris flows. loss of power, etc. In order to evaluate storm impacts on the downstream basin, a real-time hydrological modelling is used to estimate potential hazard areas. This can be used as a decision-support system for the Emergency Response center, National Fire Agency Ministry, to make 'real-time' responses and minimize possible damage to human life and property. This study used 34 observed events from 14 telemetered rain-gauges in the Tamshui River basin. Taiwan, to study the spatial-temporal characteristics of typhoon rainfall. In the study, regionalized theory and cross-semi-variograms were used to identify the spatial-temporal structure of typhoon rainfall. The power form and parameters of the cross-semi-variogram were derived through analysis of the observed data. In the end, cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the interpolated rainfall on the river basin. The results show the derived rainfall interpolator represents the observed events well. which indicates the rainfall interpolator can be used as a spatial-temporal rainfall input for real-time hydroloical modelling.

TI Dynamic Programming and the Principle of Optimality: A systematic

SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The dynamic programming recursive procedure has provided an efficient method for solving a variety of sequential decision problems related to water resources systems. In many investigations Bellman's principle of optimality is used as a proof for the optimality of the dynamic programming solutions. In this paper the dynamic programming procedure is systematically studied so as to clarify the relationship between Bellman's principle of optimality and the optimality of the dynamic programming solutions.
   Our main result is that although the principle is valid, in order to use it as a proof for the optimality of the dynamic programming solution certain modeling requirements should be met.
   The mathematical model presented in this paper provides a convenient framework for the modeling and analysis of dynamic programming problems encountered by in water resources management studies.
   The results derived here resolve few of the fundamental questions raised in the literature regarding the validity of Bellman's principle of optimality and the optimality of the dynamic programming solutions.

AB The relationship between El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events versus precipitation anomalies, and the response of seasonal precipitation to El Nino and La Nina events were investigated for 30 basins that represent a range of climatic types throughout South-east Asia and the Pacific region. The teleconnection between ENSO and the hydroclimate is tested using both parametric and non-parametric approaches, and the lag correlations between precipitation anomalies versus the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) several months earlier, as well as the coherence between SOI and precipitation anomalies are estimated. The analysis shows that dry conditions tend to be associated with El Nino in the southern zone, and part of the middle zone in the study area. The link between precipitation anomalies and ENSO is statistically significant in the southern zone and part of the middle zone of the study area, but significant correlation was not observed in the northern zone. Patterns of precipitation response may differ widely among basins, and even the response of a given river basin to individual ENSO events also may be changeable.

AB Covariance analysis was used to determine the reduction in rainfall forecast and estimation variances offered by radar reflectivity data.  Covariance analysis of a particular nonadvective linear physically based model indicated that the utility of the radar reflectivity data of various elevation angles is limited in mean areal rainfall predictions, even when a very small density of rain gauges exists over the region of interest and good quality radar data are used.  This applies to both raw reflectivity and radar rainfall data converted through a Z-R relationship.  The ratio of mean areal rainfall prediction variances, defined as variance with radar data divided by variance without radar data, was found to be greater than 0.8 in most cases.  On the other hand, the radar data reduced the estimated variance of the vertically integrated liquid water content considerably, even when high-density rain gauge data were present.

AB [ 1] A longitudinal analysis of transient flow between a river and an underlying aquifer is developed to calculate flow rates between the river and the aquifer and the location of groundwater seepage into the river as it changes over time. Two flow domains are defined in the analysis: an upstream domain of fluvial recharge, where water flows vertically from the river into the unsaturated portion of the aquifer and horizontally in saturated parts of the aquifer, and a downstream domain of groundwater seepage to the river, where groundwater flows parallel to the underlying impermeable base. The river does not necessarily penetrate completely through the aquifer. A one-dimensional, unsteady flow equation is derived from mass conservation, Darcy's law, and the geometry of the river-aquifer system to calculate the water table position and the groundwater seepage rate into the river. Models based on numerical and analytical solutions of the flow equation were applied to a reach of the Methow River in north central Washington. The calibrated models simulated groundwater seepage with a root-mean-square error less than 5% of the mean groundwater seepage rates for three low-flow evaluation periods. The analytical model provides a theoretical basis for a nonlinear exponential base flow recession generated by a draining aquifer, but not an explicit functional form for the recession. Unlike cross-sectional approaches, the longitudinal approach allows the analysis of the length and location of groundwater seepage to a river, which have important ecological implications in many rivers. In the numerical simulations, the length of the groundwater seepage varied seasonally by about 4 km and the upstream boundary of groundwater seepage was within 689 m of its location at a stream gage on 9 September 2001 and within 91 m of its location on 6 October 2002. To demonstrate its utility in ecological applications, the numerical model was used to calculate differences in length of groundwater seepage to the Methow River under an early runoff scenario and the timing of those differences with respect to life stages of chinook salmon.

TI Evaluation of rapid reservoir storage-yield procedures
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Relatively rapid and reliable procedures am required to determine reservoir storage-yield relationships during preliminary studies or reconnaissance surveys associated with regional assessments of surface water resources. Several techniques are available, but all are limited in their application. The following eight procedures were evaluated: Hurst (empirical), Alexander (gamma), Gould (synthetic), Dincer, Gould (gamma), Hardison (carryover), Guglij and McMahon (empirical). Each procedure was evaluated by application to 33 Australian and 12 Malaysian streams. The storage estimates determined from the rapid procedures were compared with those from behaviour (or simulation) analysis and Gould's transition matrix method. Limitations in theoretical models result from the basic assumptions upon which they were developed. For empirical models, difficulties arise through the non-representativeness of the basic data. Some procedures are restricted in the range of conditions within which they are applicable. The results indicate that Gould's (gamma) and McMahon's (empirical) procedures provide satisfactory storage estimates for preliminary assessments.

ID WATER CONTENT; VARIABILITY; TOPOGRAPHY; CATCHMENTS
AB Many investigations show relationships between topographical factors and the spatial distribution of soil moisture in catchments. However, few quantitative analyses have been carried out to elucidate the role of different hydrological processes in the spatial distribution of topsoil moisture in catchments. A spatially distributed rainfall-runoff model was used to investigate contributions of subsurface matric flow, macropore flow and surface runoff to the spatial distribution of soil moisture in a cultivated catchment. The model results show that lateral subsurface flow in the soil matrix or in macropores has a minor effect on the spatial distribution of soil moisture. Only when a perched groundwater table is maintained long enough, which is only possible if the subsurface is completely impermeable, may a spatial distribution in moisture content occur along the slope. Surface runoff, producing accumulations of soil moisture in flat flow paths of agricultural origin (field boundaries), was demonstrated to cause significant spatial variations in soil moisture within a short period after rainfall (<2 days). When significant amounts of surface runoff are produced, wetter moisture conditions will be generated at locations with larger upstream contributing areas. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; GEOSTATISTICS
AB When using indicator geostatistics to represent the distribution of hydrofacies or lithofacies, the range and curvature of the autotransition probabilities or the autovariogram are related to the variation in facies lengths. As the coefficients oriodf variation for the length of each facies increase toward unity, the effective range increases while the indicator-correlation structure evolves from a periodic linear structure to a somewhat peic spherical structure to an aperiodic exponential structure. Multimodal distributions of facies lengths can give rise to autotransition probabilities or autovariograms that appear to have nested structures. With the understanding of these relationships it is possible to choose a model form and model parameters for the autotransition probability or autovariogram based upon the facies proportions and the modality, mean, and variance in length of the facies. This is illustrated with data from a case study.

AB Surface soil moisture and the nature of the overlying vegetation both influence microwave emission from land surfaces significantly. One widely discussed but underused method for allowing for the effect of vegetation on soil-moisture retrievals from microwave observations is to use remotely sensed vegetation indices. This paper explores the potential for using the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in soil-moisture retrievals from L-band (1.4 GHz) aircraft data gathered during the Southern Great Plains '97 (SGP97) experiment. A simplified version of MICRO-SWEAT, a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer (S VAT) scheme coupled with a microwave emission model, was used as the retrieval algorithm. Estimates of the optical depth of the vegetation, the parameter that describes the effect of the vegetation on microwave emission, were obtained by calibrating this retrieval algorithm against measurements of soil moisture at 15 field sites. A significant relationship was found between the optical depth so obtained and the observed NDVI at these sites, although this relationship changed with the resolution of the microwave brightness temperature observations used. Soil-moisture estimates made with the retrieval algorithm using the empirical relationship between optical depth and NDVI applied at two additional sites not used in the calibration show good agreement with field measurements.

TI Application of an improved linear storage routing model for the
   estimation of large floods
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE flood estimation; flood modelling; storage routing
AB A runoff routing model, which incorporates a linear routing structure and attempts to provide a physically realistic distribution of storage effects, has recently been developed. The model with its physically realistic storage effects has been shown to provide consistently good reproduction of observed large floods without the need for parameter fitting or calibration. Storage distribution is determined from a volume law that accounts for the distribution of river channel storage in natural catchments. The model is briefly described, but the emphasis is on demonstrating its ability to reproduce large observed floods and design floods in China and Australia. The model results are compared with those from two commonly used non-linear storage routing models using several measures of performance. The probable maximum floods (PMFs) estimated based on all three models are also compared. The linear model using the proposed volume law is recommended for estimation of design floods because it has been shown to represent the observed geomorphological processes more realistically than other models, and because it reproduces observed large floods at least as well as the other models considered in this study.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; HYDROGRAPH SEPARATION; COMPLEXITY
AB Base flow separation has often been portrayed as the process of removing a high-frequency event (runoff) from a streamflow time series to determine the low-frequency component (base flow). Fourier decomposition of several models of streamflow components suggests that this view is inaccurate. Base flow is a predominantly low-frequency phenomenon, but runoff has a broad bandwidth with a significant low-frequency "signal." Base flow separation with digital filters is the attempt to isolate these two signals. Perfect separation is not possible because of the overlapping frequency content. Removal of low-frequency runoff signal will also partially attenuate base flow. Some principles of filter theory are used to suggest optimal filtering procedures for one commonly used recursive filter. To maximize runoff removal while minimizing base flow attenuation and phase distortion, it is usually best to use two high-attenuation filter passes as opposed to several low-attenuation passes.

AB Velocity covariances for saturated heterogeneous formations with anisotropic structures were derived for mean flow parallel and perpendicular to the formation bedding and were employed for modeling transport in these formations by the use of a Lagrangian formulation. Relatively simple analytical expressions, each requiring only a single numerical integration, were obtained for the longitudinal and transverse components of the velocity covariance, the displacement covariance, and the macrodispersion coefficient tensors, all as functions of the anisotropy of the formation. Closed-form analytical expressions were derived for the longitudinal and transverse components of the velocity variance and for the asymptotic values of the transverse components of the displacement covariance. The applicability of this approach for modeling flow and transport in the vadose zone is tested in the companion to this paper by the use of the stochastic theory of Yeh et al. (1985a, b) for unsaturated flow.

AB [1] The goal of the investigations is to estimate the uncertainty in the location of two-dimensional, steady state catchments of pumping wells due to the uncertainty of the spatially variable transmissivity field. The uncertainty is evaluated conditional to measured transmissivity and head data. The uncertainty bandwidth of the catchment boundary is approximated in first order by formulating the conditional transversal second moment of the particle displacements along the expected mean particle trajectory. However, empirical relationships have to be provided for the estimation of the uncertainty in the location of stagnation points. Applications of the approach are presented for a synthetic test case with two arrangements of measurement stations. The results are compared with those from conditional numerical Monte Carlo simulations. The comparison allows an assessment of the accuracy and the applicability of the method. The approximation corresponds quite well with the Monte Carlo simulations.

AB Using wetlands as a sink of nutrients, phosphorus in particular, is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to conventional wastewater treatment technology. In this paper, we briefly review the mechanism of phosphorus retention in wetlands, as well as previous modeling efforts. A Bayesian method is then proposed for estimating the long-term phosphorus accretion rate in wetlands through a piecewise linear model of outflow phosphorus concentration and phosphorus mass loading rate. The Bayesian approach was used for its simplicity in computation and its ability to accurately represent uncertainty. Applied to an Everglades wetland, the Bayesian method not only produced the probability distribution of the long-term phosphorus accretion rate but also generated a relationship of acceptable level of ''risk'' and optimal phosphorus mass loading rate for the proposed constructed wetlands in south Florida. The latter is a useful representation of uncertainty which is of interest to decision makers.

AB Water resource droughts in the UK have occurred with regularity over the last 20 years. In Yorkshire, the most severe of these was from 1995 to 1996, with a return period estimate of over 200 years. `Severe' drought events since 1881 in the Yorkshire region are classified using two drought severity indices based on 3- and 6-monthly cumulative precipitation anomalies. Atmospheric circulation contrasts associated with the droughts are analysed and a methodology developed to identify water resource droughts in Yorkshire using historical weather-type information rather than precipitation data.
   Using a weather-type index to extend drought series and revise estimates of drought return periods is a potentially useful technique. The methodology is applied from 1881 to 1998 and highlights a large number of severe drought events between 1884 and 1896 which can be substantiated using anecdotal evidence. However, the drought events of the 1880s and 1890s have not generally been used when calculating return periods for recent drought events due to scarcity of long-term daily precipitation data. The validity of return period estimates of recent drought events must therefore be questioned. This research confirms the need for the reassessment of return period estimates for contemporary drought events particularly given current climatic trends, the rapid onset of recent droughts and rising water demands.

AB In recent years many methods for statistical down-scaling of the precipitation climate model outputs have been developed. Statistical downscaling is performed under general and method-specific (structural) assumptions but those are rarely evaluated simultaneously. This paper illustrates the verification and evaluation of the downscaling assumptions for a weather typing method. Using the observations and outputs of a global climate model ensemble, the skill of the method is evaluated for precipitation downscaling in central Belgium during the winter season (December to February). Shortcomings of the studied method have been uncovered and are identified as biases and a time-variant predictor-predictand relationship. The predictor-predictand relationship is found to be informative for historical observations but becomes inaccurate for the projected climate model output. The latter inaccuracy is explained by the increased importance of the thermodynamic processes in the precipitation changes. The results therefore question the applicability of the weather typing method for the case study location. Besides the shortcomings, the results also demonstrate the added value of the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship for precipitation amount scaling. The verification and evaluation of the downscaling assumptions are a tool to design a statistical downscaling ensemble tailored to end-user needs.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; REPRESENTATION; EXTREMES; TRENDS
AB In this study, information extracted from the first global urban fluvial flood risk data set (Aqueduct) is investigated and visualized to explore current and projected city-level flood impacts driven by urbanization and climate change. We use a novel adaption of the self-organizing map (SOM) method, an artificial neural network proficient at clustering, pattern extraction, and visualization of large, multi-dimensional data sets. Prevalent patterns of current relationships and anticipated changes over time in the nonlinearly-related environmental and social variables are presented, relating urban river flood impacts to socioeconomic development and changing hydrologic conditions. Comparisons are provided between 98 individual cities. Output visualizations compare baseline and changing trends of city- specific exposures of population and property to river flooding, revealing relationships between the cities based on their relative map placements. Cities experiencing high (or low) baseline flood impacts on population and/or property that are expected to improve (or worsen), as a result of anticipated climate change and development, are identified and compared. This paper condenses and conveys large amounts of information through visual communication to accelerate the understanding of relationships between local urban conditions and global processes.

AB Averting climate change may have substantial water-resource-related benefits to agricultural, industrial, recreational, and residential household users. Economic benefits are usually estimated assuming that individuals face no uncertainty in decision making, but the benefits from averting climate change will accrue primarily to individuals in the future. Predicting future; benefits is usually done using ex ante economic methods, and propogating uncertainty or specifiying the appropriate distributions in estimating the magnitude of the benefits is a problem. After describing the key issues relating climate change and water resources, the paper explains why economic theory fails to demonstrate which method appears more reasonable than the other. Alternatively, we might attempt to estimate the benefits from averting climate change using a benefits analysis of similar events that have already occurred. Many suggestions for conducting a benefits transfer, including one in the area of water-based recreation, are offered as ways to glean something about possible water-resource-related benefits from averting climate change.

AB Percolation theory is used in this paper to study the general accessibility characteristics of bond site correlated networks in the presence or absence of spatial correlations among the sites. Spectral methods are employed to generate networks in which the sites are spatially correlated according to exponential or Gaussian autocovariance functions. Monte Carlo simulations are performed for bond-correlated site percolation with and without trapping, as related to drainage-type displacements of water by oil (or air) and air by mercury, respectively. For the correlation modes studied, it is found that spatial correlations result in significant reduction of the site percolation threshold with a concomitant modification of the site accessibility. However, the bond accessibility characteristics and the bond percolation threshold are not significantly affected. The simulated drainage capillary pressure curves become more gradual and the residual wetting phase saturation associated with oil (or air)-water displacements is significantly decreased when spatial correlations among the pore bodies exist.

AB Flume experiments were conducted in order to monitor changes in flow turbulence intensity and suspended sediment concentration at seven stages across the ripple-dune transition and at three different positions above the bed surface. Three-dimensional velocity measurements were obtained using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV). Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was monitored indirectly using ADV signal amplitude. Although limited to time-averaged parameters, the analysis reveals that SSC varies significantly with stage across the transition and with sampling height. The statistical analysis also reveals an apparent uniformity of suspended sediment concentration with height above the bed in the lower half of the flow depth at the critical stage in the transition from ripples to dunes. This is also the stage at which turbulence intensity is maximized. Statistically significant correlations were also observed between suspended sediment concentrations and root-mean-square values of vertical velocity fluctuations. These correlations reflect the various levels of shear-layer activity and the distinct turbulent flow regions across the transition. Conversely, time-averaged values of Reynolds shear stress exhibit a very weak relationship with suspended sediment concentrations. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Many studies have identified global warming and climate change as some of the biggest challenges facing Canada. In this paper, the regional temporal trend in river flows is investigated using a space-time model. Though the primary focus is the time component, the spatial relationship among monitoring stations in a region is used to develop a space-time model that is composed of a random time trend as a function of space, and a random error term as a function of both time and space. The estimate of regional time trend is a linear combination of the differenced observations that minimizes the variance of estimated errors.
   Data from 248 river stations in the Reference Hydrometric Basin Network (RHBN) established by Environment Canada is analysed. These hydrological monitoring stations are grouped into ten non-overlapping homogeneous regions covering all of Canada. An estimate of trend, along with its variance, is calculated for each region. Some significant trends are found for the annual mean, maximum and minimum flows, as well as for the mean monthly flows for July and December, and are consistent with those detected in other Canadian studies.

DT Article
ID INTEGRATED MODEL; FOOD SECURITY; RESOURCES; LIBERALIZATION
AB A debate has long existed on the relationships between human population, natural resources, and development. Recent research has expanded this debate to include the impacts of trade; specifically, virtual water trade, or the water footprint of traded commodities. We conduct an empirical analysis of the relationships between virtual water trade, population, and development in Africa. We find that increases in virtual water imports do not lead to increases in population growth nor do they diminish human welfare. We establish a new index of virtual water trade openness and show that levels of undernourishment tend to fall with increased values of virtual water trade openness. Countries with small dam storage capacity obtain a higher fraction of their agricultural water requirements from external sources, which may indicate implicit "infrastructure sharing" across nations. Globally, increased crop exports tend to correlate with increased crop water use efficiency, though this relationship does not hold for Africa. However, internal African trade is much more efficient in terms of embodied water resources than any other region in the world. Thus, internal African trade patterns may be compensating for poor internal production systems.

AB The last decade has witnessed the development of methodologies for the post-flood documentation of both hydrogeomorphological and social response to extreme precipitation. These investigations are particularly interesting for the case of flash floods, whose space-time scales make their observations by conventional hydrometeorological monitoring networks particularly challenging. Effective flash flood documentation requires post-flood survey strategies encompassing accurate radar estimation of rainfall, field and remote-sensing observations of the geomorphic processes, indirect reconstruction of peak discharges-as well eyewitness interviews. These latter can give valuable information on both flood dynamics and the related individual and collective responses. This study describes methods for post-flood surveys based on interdisciplinary collaborations between natural and social scientists. These surveys may help to better understand the links between hydrometeorological dynamics and geomorphic processes as well as the relationship between flood dynamics and behavioral response in the context of fast space-time changes of flooding conditions.

AB [1] Numerous single-hole and cross-hole pneumatic injection tests have been conducted in unsaturated fractured tuff at the Apache Leap Research Site (ALRS) near Superior, Arizona. Single-hole tests have yielded values of air permeability at various locations throughout the tested rock volume on a nominal scale of similar to1 m. Cross-hole tests have yielded equivalent air permeabilities (and air-filled porosities) for a rock volume characterized by a length scale of several tens of meters. Cross-hole tests have also provided high-resolution tomographic estimates of how air permeability (and air-filled porosity), defined over grid blocks having a length scale of 1 m, vary throughout a similar rock volume. The results have revealed a highly pronounced scale effect in permeability (and porosity) at the ALRS. We examine the extent to which the permeability scale effect is amenable to interpretation by a recent stochastic scaling theory, which treats the rock as a truncated random fractal.

   EQUATION; SCALE-DEPENDENT DISPERSION COEFFICIENT
AB The classical convection-dispersion equation (CDE) and the stochastical convection-dispersion equation (SCDE) were utilized to study solute transport in homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media.  Extensive experimental data collected in 1 250-cm soil columns were used for testing validity of the CDE and SCDE.  Analyses of the experimental data showed that the observed dispersion coefficient increased with the travel distance for both homogeneous and heterogeneous soils.  The range of the dispersion coefficients was from 0.05 to 20 cm2 min-1 for the homogeneous soil, and from 3 to 200 cm2 min-1 for the heterogeneous soil.  A linear relationship between the dispersion coefficient and travel distance, assumed in the SCDE, described the scale-dependent dispersion coefficient reasonably well.  Therefore, the SCDE predicted solute transport in the porous media more accurately than the CDE for these examples.  In addition, the SCDE provided more consistent estimation of breakthrough curves than the CDE, using information obtained at a location either close to or far from the predicting place.

ID MODEL
AB Perceptions of drinking water quality were measured for residents at four locations in Western Australia. The total dissolved solid levels for the locations varied. Four scales of drinking water satisfaction were measured: acceptability of water quality; water quality risk judgment; perception of neighborhood water quality; and attitudes toward fluoride as an additive. Responses to each of these scales did not appear to be highly related to total dissolved solids. The relationship between attitudes toward water quality and a variety of psychological, attitudinal, experiential, and demographic variables was investigated. It was found that responses to the acceptability of water quality and water quality risk judgment scales related to perceived credibility of societal institutions and feelings of control over water quality and environmental problems. For the remaining two scales few significant correlations were found. The results support those who advocate localized information and involvement campaigns on drinking water quality issues.

   DISTRIBUTION; CAPILLARY NETWORKS; STRATIFIED AQUIFER
AB Using spectral stochastic theory, macrodispersivity tensors are developed for one-, two-, and three-dimensional isotropic and anisotropic fractal porous media. Since natural geologic aquifers are always bounded, we introduce the concept of a maximum length scale (L(max)). In the one-dimensional case, the asymptotic (long-time) longitudinal macrodispersivity (A(infinity)) is proportional to L(max)(2), and in the multidimensional cases, A(infinity) proportional to L(max). In the multidimensional cases, as the fractal dimension increases, A(infinity) decreases, because a larger fractal dimension means the tortuosity of solute particles is larger, leading to more mixing in the transverse direction, which in turn reduces longitudinal spreading. The transverse macrodispersivities are shown to be analogous to traditional spectral stochastic results. In the multidimensional cases, L(max) is shown to be controlled by the aquifer thickness. As a result, ergodic conditions may be reached in relatively thin aquifers, allowing the use of the asymptotic macrodispersivity expressions obtained here for single realizations.

AB Spatial patterns of N dynamics in soil were evaluated within two small forested watersheds in Japan. These two watersheds were characterized by steep slopes (>30 degrees) and high stream NO3- drainage rates (8.4 to 25.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) that were greater than bulk precipitation N input rates (7.5 to 13.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Higher rates of nitrification potential at near-stream zones were reflected in greater NO3- contents for soil at the near-stream zones compared with ridge zones. Both stream discharge rates and NO3- concentrations in deep unsaturated soil at the near-stream zones were positively correlated to NO3- concentrations in stream water. These relationships, together with high soil NO3- contents at the near-stream zones, suggest that the near-stream zone was an important source of NO3- to stream water. Nitrate flux from these near-stream zones was also related to the drainage of cations (K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+). The steep slope of the watersheds resulted in small saturated areas that contributed to the high NO3- production thigh nitrification rates) in the near-stream zone. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although more complicated than two-dimensional cases which were previously presented, the three-dimensional ''Rankine bodies'' are more appropriate for simulating flow around real objects. Generally, the appropriate potentials and velocity fields are easy to write down and evaluate, in fact, much easier than the alternative solutions based on scattering theory. Also, arrays of bodies can be arranged to simulate a repeated pattern rather than deal with only single barriers, cavities, etc. However, the shapes of the bodies are not known ahead of time and can only be roughly controlled. For the same Darcian flow, a simulated stony layer was shown to be wetter than that without stones and the effective saturated conductivity reduced somewhat less than 1 - f(s) where f(s) is the fraction of stones. Overall there is a qualitative agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results for both saturated and unsaturated flow. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB An extensive sediment monitoring network was established within the LOIS programme, involving 10 of the main tributaries of the River Humber (UK). Its primary purpose was to measure the flux of suspended sediment to the estuary. A turbidity monitoring system was developed to provide a continuous record of suspended sediment concentration in the rivers, from which the fluxes were calculated. Linear relationships were established between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity (with slopes varying from 0.89 to 1.69) to enable the conversion of nephelometric turbidity [NTU] to suspended sediment concentration [mg l(-1)]. Potential uncertainties were identified and quantified. The suspended sediment flux to the Humber (November 1994-October 1997) was calculated to be 699 861 t, equivalent to a yield of 15 t km(-2) yr(-1). Large temporal and spatial variations in the flux were measured during the monitoring period, in response to factors such as climate, land use, catchment scale, deposition and reservoir trapment. The particle size composition of the suspended sediment was measured and found to vary little, except at very high discharges, when it coarsened. The organic content of the sediment was found to be directly related to the discharge of sewage effluent to the rivers. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The distribution of water content in time and space at the soil surface has been investigated on a small farmland catchment (1 . 3 km(2)) from four held surveys corresponding to different moisture statuses. For each survey, about 400 samples were collected at the soil surface at a depth of 5 cm along ten axes parallel to the greatest slope. The relationship between the measurements and the topography has been analysed. The structure of the data is well explained by a topographic index referring to the downslope conditions and defined as the elevation difference between the sample point and the stream point corresponding to the outlet of the water pathway derived from the digital elevation model (DEM). This index can be considered as an hydraulic head, at least for saturated conditions. A threshold for this index allows two domains within the catchment to be distinguished; an upper domain where the water content is nearly constant and varies slowly, and a lower domain where moisture status increases and is highly variable. The spatial distribution of these two domains is well correlated to the spatial distribution of the soils. Thus, both topography and the spatial distribution of soil appear to control the spatial distribution of surface water content at the 1-km(2) scale.

AB The aim of this research was to refine the actual conceptual model related to the activation of high-altitude temporary springs within the carbonate Apennines in southern Italy. The research was carried out through geophysical, hydrogeological, hydrochemical and isotopic investigations at the Acqua dei Faggi experimental site during five hydrologic years.
   The research demonstrated that, in carbonate aquifers where low-permeability faults cause the aquifer system to be compartmentalized, high-altitude temporary springs may be recharged by groundwater. In such settings. neither surface water infiltration in karst systems nor perched temporary aquifers play a role of utmost importance. The rare (once or a few time a year) activation of such springs is due to the fact that groundwater unusually reach the threshold head that allows the spring to flow. The activation of the studied high-altitude temporary spring also depended on relationships between a low-permeability fault core and a karst system that locally interrupts the low-permeability barrier. In fact, when the hydraulic head did not reach the karst system, the concentrated head loss within the fault core did not allow the spring to flow, because the groundwater entirely flowed through the fault towards the downgradient compartment.

AB It has been shown that the calibration of soil vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) models is inherently uncertain, even when data are available over a relatively limited homogeneous area. The representation of subgrid-scale variability of fluxes is not easily achieved because of the lack of information available about appropriate parameter distributions and their covariance. However, remote sensing of thermal surface responses offers the possibility of obtaining distributed estimates of surface fluxes. In this paper, multiple Landsat-Thematic Mapper (TM) images of the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site are used to derive uncertain estimates of the land surface-atmosphere sensible and latent fluxes over a period of time. Employing a framework based on fuzzy set theory, the parameter space representing all feasible parameterizations of a SVAT model are examined with respect to these image estimates. Areal weightings for a number of functional types of flux behavior are then derived through which the temporal evolution of surface fluxes can be estimated.

AB Qualitative understanding of the processes controlling phosphorus (P) export from agricultural land has been significantly improved in recent years. Problems remain in predicting P losses despite the requirement of toots providing accurate predictions by legislation such as the EU Water Framework Directive. Decision making, not only in the field of diffuse pollution, often relies on Limited data. This study is aiming to predict annual P export from agricultural catchments using a very simple approach that concentrates on the functional behaviour of a catchment.
   Two simple fuzzy decision trees have been established to predict both total P filtered at 0.45 mu m (TP < 0.45) and particulate P (TP > 0.45) export. The predictions are within range of the P export estimated from measured data using discharge-concentration rating curves. The fuzzy method is capable of identifying the catchments having high P export and reproduces the pattern of P export for wet and dry years, especially for TP < 0.45. The predicted fuzzy ranges for TP > 0.45 export are wide. The available data indicate that single events have a high importance for TP > 0.45 export. We assume that an event-based decision tree might be the appropriate approach to constrain the uncertainties.
   The proposed methodology is simple. For both trees, a classification is made based on only four input variables using fuzzy rules. The rules do not depend on the estimation of numerous parameters but can easily be adapted once new information becomes available. Therefore, the fuzzy system has a high potential to be used as a decision support tool for policy makers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The long-term water level variations of the Dead Sea (DS) were assessed using a previously developed simulation model. The model establishes the condition of the DS by evaluating a series of ordinary differential equations describing mass balances on the water and major chemical species. The DS was modelled as a two-layer system. The model was modified using up-to-date inflow data and recent hypsometric graphs to derive the volume-area-level relationships. Three scenarios were studied: continuation of current conditions; a cessation in industrial activity when the DS water level drops to a certain level; and a simplified weather change scenario. The model predicted that the DS will not dry up, but its level will continue to drop with a decelerating rate with no equilibrium level in 500 years. Changing climate would accelerate the level drop. In the 500 year period, after an initial increase, the DS salinity drops. The opposite behaviour is noted in the evaporation rate, which increases after an initial decrease. Ceasing industrial pumping would eventually restore the DS to its normal level, but with changed conditions. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The position and rate of change of the advance front due to surface water spreading on a flat surface is computed using a two-step approach. The size of the spreading pool is first calculated using a volume balance equation. The geometric shape of the pool area is then approximated using potential theory. This is simplified by using distributed point sources to represent the source. A combination of both techniques allows isochrones of the advance front from any source to be predicted. Site specific advance front velocity values are calculated from the constructed isochrones. An equation is also presented for the general rate of change of the pool area. Isochrones families, for a number of different shaped sources, are presented as is a discussion on the construction of streamlines. The isochrones lines are also used to define lines of constant infiltration opportunity time and constant cumulative infiltration. The combined technique offers a foundation on which to later add many of the processes associated with water spreading on the surface.

DE rainfall erosion; predicting soil loss; non-uniform hill slopes
AB Despite revisions and refinements, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), which is the revised version of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), over predicts small annual soil losses and under predicts large annual soil losses. To some large extent, this results from the equation over estimating small event soil losses and under estimating large event soil losses. Replacing the USLE/RUSLE event erosivity index (EI30) by the product of EI30 and the runoff ratio (Q(R)) significantly reduces the errors in estimating event erosion when runoff is measured, but the USLE-M, the USLE variant that uses the Q(R)EI(30) index, requires crop and support practice factors that differ from those used in the RUSLE. The theory which enables the Q(R)EI(30) index to be used in association with the RUSLE crop and support practice factors is presented. In addition, the USLE/RUSLE approach was developed for conditions where runoff is produced uniformly over a hill slope. A runoff dependent slope length factor that takes account of runoff variations over a hill slope is presented and demonstrated for the situation where runoff from a low runoff producing area passes onto an area where runoff is produced more readily.

DT Article
AB [1] This study reports sediment yields from seven small (0.18 - 5.42 ha) watersheds in Southern Arizona measured from 1995 to 2005. Sediment concentrations and total event sediment yields were related to storm-runoff characteristics, and statistical relationships were developed to estimate sediment yields for events with missing data. Precipitation ranged from 263 to 298 mm yr(-1), runoff ranged from 8.2 to 26.4 mm yr(-1), and sediment yields ranged from 0.07 to 5.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1), with an areal average of 2.2 t ha(-1) yr(-1). For six of the seven watersheds, between 6 and 10 events produced 50% of the total sediment yields over the 11-year period. On the seventh watershed, two storms produced 66% of the sediment because of differences in the geomorphology and vegetation characteristics of that area. Differences between sediment yields from all watersheds were attributable to instrumentation, watershed morphology, degree of channel incision, and vegetation.

AB The relationship between water content and water potential for a soil is termed its water retention curve. This basic hydraulic property is closely related to the soil pore size distribution, for which it serves asa conventional method of measurement. In this paper a general model of the water retention curve, is derived for soils whose pore size distribution is fractal in the sense of the Mandelbrot number-size distribution. This model, which contains two adjustable parameters (the fractal dimension and the upper limiting value of the fractal porosity) is shown to include other fractal approaches to the water retention curve as special cases. Application of the general model to a number of published data sets covering a broad range of soil texture indicated that unique, independent values of the two adjustable parameters may be difficult to obtain by statistical analysis of water retention data for a given soil. Discrimination among different fractal approaches thus will require water retention data of high density and precision.

AB [1] Most existing methods of calculating contributing area are unable to accurately model the pattern of contributing area on hillslopes and along valley bottoms. This paper describes a new flow algorithm, the adjustable dispersion routing algorithm (ADRA). Rather than calculating contributing area using predetermined flow characteristics that are insensitive to location in the landscape, ADRA predicts channel location and adjusts flow characteristics accordingly. ADRA increases the degree of flow divergence downslope from divides until a channel head is detected. Channel head locations are estimated on the basis of a user-defined threshold of an area-slope function. Therefore the algorithm overcomes the problems of aggregated flow on hillslopes and divergent flow along valley bottoms. The pattern of catchment area produced by ADRA was compared with similar patterns calculated using a similar flow algorithm for a variety of natural landscapes. ADRA produced patterns of contributing area that were more consistent with the theory of channel initiation.

AB The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), initiated by the World Climate Research Program, has as a main objective the production of monthly global rainfall estimates on a 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees longitude/latitude grid by combining different sources of information such as satellite remote sensing and rain gauges. It:is important to understand the accuracy of the rain gauge estimates of mean area rainfall because these are considered the most reliable estimates for regions with high numbers of gauges. Methods to model the error resulting from using rain gauge data to estimate the spatially averaged rainfall accumulation have been developed previously. Three of these methods are investigated in this study: an empirical equation derived from rain gauge data, an analytical equation derived from statistical concepts, and an empirical equation derived from theory with parameters determined from calibration. Simulations are performed to determine the utility of these three approaches in estimating the error of the rain gauge mean in the context of the GPCP.

AB We present a new analysis for Corrsin's hypothesis. We show this hypothesis is the leading term contribution in a renormalization group perturbation expansion. We present the exact results of a nonlinear dynamic equation obtained from Corrsin's hypothesis. The macroscopic dispersion induced by a random velocity field on all timescales is studied. Due to the nonlinearity of the governing equation, the transient growth rate of the mixing layer is nonfractal even for a fractal velocity field. For a velocity field with, an exponentially decaying correlation function, the comparisons of the exact results under Corrsin's approximation with the results from the linear and quasi-linear theories are presented. The results from Corrsin's hypothesis show that for an exponentially decaying correlation function with variance sigma, the longitudinal asymptotic dispersion coefficient is proportional to sigma(2) for Small values of sigma and proportional to sigma for large values of sigma. This result is further confirmed by a mean field approximation.

AB [1] A multiple regression model was applied to annual time series data (1936-1998) in an attempt to quantify the influence of irrigation wells on annual streamflows of Frenchman Creek in Southwestern Nebraska where intensive well development has taken place since 1950. A strong statistical relationship was found between the logarithm of streamflow and number of wells, current and lagged annual precipitation, and two variables that are the geometric mean of precipitation and number of wells in the current year and the year before last. Estimated mean streamflow from the statistical model in 1998 is approximately one third of that in 1950. A simpler model without the interaction terms between number of wells and precipitation was estimated for the Republican River near its final entry into Kansas from Nebraska, and an even greater decline in mean annual streamflow was found. The present mean is approximately one quarter of the 1950 level.

AB Three-dimensional numerical simulations using a detailed synthetic hydraulic conductivity field developed from geological considerations provide insight into the scaling of subsurface flow and transport processes. Flow and advective transport in the highly resolved heterogeneous field were modeled using massively parallel computers, providing a realistic baseline for evaluation of the impacts of parameter scaling. Upscaling of hydraulic conductivity was performed at a variety of scales using a flexible power law averaging technique. A series of tests were performed to determine the effects of varying the scaling exponent on a number of metrics of flow and transport behavior. Flow and transport simulation on high-performance computers and three-dimensional scientific visualization combine to form a powerful tool for gaining insight into the behavior of complex heterogeneous systems.
   Many quantitative groundwater models utilize upscaled hydraulic conductivity parameters, either implicitly or explicitly. These parameters are designed to reproduce the bulk flow characteristics at the grid or field scale while not requiring detailed quantification of local-scale conductivity variations. An example from applied groundwater modeling is the common practice of calibrating grid-scale model hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity parameters so as to approximate observed hydraulic head and boundary flux values. Such parameterizations, perhaps with a bulk dispersivity imposed, are then sometimes used to predict transport of reactive or nonreactive solutes. However, this work demonstrates that those parameters that lead to the best upscaling for hydraulic conductivity and head do not necessarily correspond to the best upscaling for prediction of a variety of transport behaviors. This result reflects the fact that transport is strongly impacted by the existence and connectedness of extreme-valued hydraulic conductivities, in contrast to bulk flow which depends more strongly on mean values. It provides motivation for continued research into upscaling methods for transport that directly address advection in heterogeneous porous media.

AB [1] Genetic programming ( GP) is used to develop models of rainfall recharge from observations of rainfall recharge and rainfall, calculated potential evapotranspiration ( PET) and soil profile available water ( PAW) at four sites over a 4 year period in Canterbury, New Zealand. This work demonstrates that the automatic model induction method is a useful development in modeling rainfall recharge. The five best performing models evolved by genetic programming show a highly nonlinear relationship between rainfall recharge and the independent variables. These models are dominated by a positive correlation with rainfall, a negative correlation with the square of PET, and a negative correlation with PAW. The best performing GP models are more reliable than a soil water balance model at predicting rainfall recharge when rainfall recharge is observed in the late spring, summer, and early autumn periods. The "best'' GP model provides estimates of cumulative sums of rainfall recharge that are closer than a soil water balance model to observations at all four sites.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; MODEL
AB A boundary integral formulation is developed for flow of two immiscible, incompressible phases in a porous medium.  With the boundary integral formulation, large computational domains may be considered with little impact on accuracy or computational effort, as the boundary integral mesh is placed only along contours of phase saturation and the domain boundaries.  Time stepping is performed by updating the position of the contours based on phase fluxes obtained with a total flux formulation.  Capillary pressure gradients are treated by interpolating saturation between contours using a separate boundary integral step; accordingly, the formulation is not restricted to the special form of the constitutive relationships implied in the quasi-linear approximation to unsaturated flow.  Examples of one-dimensional and radial two-phase flow are simulated, with excellent agreement to the corresponding analytical solutions.  Vertical imbibition of trichoroethylene into an initially pristine aquifer is simulated with both a finite element simulator and the boundary integral simulator, with good agreement between the two methods.

Under the assumption that there is exactly one outer ridge link positioned between any two neighboring outer channel links, the paper analyzes such interlocking networks by investigating their dual graphs.  Several formal relationships are established which translate into a set of both existing and new theorems describing the close interdependency of channel and ridge parameters:  Interlocking networks are of equal magnitude, the link numbers of the ridge and channel paths enclosing channel and ridge subnetworks have the same mean value, the link number of the boundary path enclosing a subnetwork is equal to the number of boundary paths passing through the root of the subnetwork, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the inner nodes of the two networks as well as between their paths, and every such pair of corresponding ridge and channel paths delineates an area that is closed with regard to slope runoff.

AB Classical optimization methodologies based oil mathematical theories have been developed for the solution of: various constrained environmental design problems. Numerical models have been widely used to represent an environmental system accurately. The use of methodologies Such LIS artificial neural networks (ANNs), which approximate the complicated behaviour and response of physical systems, allows the optimization of a large number of case scenarios with different set of constraints within a short period of time. whereas the corresponding simulation time using a numerical model Would be prohibitive. In this paper, a combination of an ANN with a differential evolution algorithm is proposed to replace the classical finite-element numerical model in water resources management problems. The objective of the optimization problem is to determine the optimal operational strategy tor the productive pumping wells located in the northern part of Rhodes Island in Greece, to cover the water demand and maintain the water table at certain levels. The conclusions of: this Study show that the use of ANN as an approximation model Could (a) significantly reduce the computational burden associated with the accurate Simulation of complex physical systems and (b) provide solutions very close to the optimal ones for various constrained environmental design problems.

AB The travel distances of particles ranging in size from 2.88 mm to 10.63 mm were investigated in laboratory simulations of interrill. overland flow. Using travel distances scaled for differences among the experiments in flow and rainfall energy, a relationship between distance traveled and particle size is obtained that shows a steep reduction in travel distance with increase in particle size. Travel distance is the outcome of two probabilities: that of moving and that of coming to rest. In interrill flow, the former is controlled by rainfall energy, but the latter is controlled by flow energy. Analysis of subsets of the data in which only rainfall or flow energy varied shows that the steep reduction in travel distance with particle size is primarily due to sensitivity to flow energy. Although particle movement (entrainment) by rainfall energy does vary with particle size, the sensitivity is less.

AB Observations of plant-flow interactions on salt marshes have revealed a highly complex process dominated by the tightly coupled effects of plant characteristics and hydrodynamic conditions. This paper highlights the importance of vegetation structures such as plant density and height, as well as their spatial variability and mechanical properties including flexibility, upon energy dissipation and flow modification. Many field, laboratory and modeling studies which attempt to predict flow dissipation or improve our understanding of plant-flow interactions use simplified structural measures of salt marsh vegetation or artificial representations. These simplifications neglect important plant and canopy elements and are unlikely to be truly representative of their natural counterparts. Such approaches limit our understanding of plant-flow interactions and potentially compromise the predictive accuracy and application of numerical flow models. It is important therefore that improved techniques to measure vegetation structure are adopted in order to better define the key relationships between measurable plant characteristics and drag-relevant plant properties.

   CAPILLARY HYSTERESIS; WATER-MOVEMENT; LAYERED SOILS; POROUS-MEDIA;
   INFILTRATION; PERSISTENCE
AB The stability and persistence of preferential flow paths in sands can determine the flow paths of subsequent infiltration events. We have measured the evolution of preferential flow paths in a slab of sandy soil using an array of tensiometers and light transmission. The pressure and water content measurements show that the nonuniform moisture content exists even when the potentials are equalized horizontally and that then are the result of hysteresis in the soil's pressure-saturation relationship. The equalization of potential takes place over several days, if at all, and is consistent, initially, with estimates of vapor transport out of the finger cores. Once the soil is wet enough, the remainder of water movement takes place in liquid films. Hysteresis produces another interesting situation when the pack is drained. We find that the wetter portions of the soil can be at a lower potential than the drier portions, resulting in a horizontal driving force for a flow of water from the drier to the wetter soil.

   AGGRADATION
AB We report sensitivity tests on a numerical model of the development of downstream fining by size-selective transport and deposition above a base level in a gravel-bed river with no lateral inputs of water or sediment. Strong fining requires deposition mainly to the surface; otherwise, its amount and streamwise distribution are not highly sensitive to any single factor but vary somewhat with hiding factor, excess shear stress, and bed sorting. Low initial concavity inhibits fining, but different higher concavities generate fairly similar fining profiles. Lower sediment supply leads to a coarser bed with less fining, but there is no simple relationship between fining and aggradation rate. The rate of development of fining is sensitive to all these factors but is always rapid initially, followed by a far slower approach towards final equilibrium. Surface grain size adjustment is potentially an important degree of freedom in river response to any environmental change or human impact which causes overloading.

TI ASYMPTOTIC CALCULATION OF LAPLACE INVERSE IN ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS OF
   GROUNDWATER PROBLEMS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The Laplace transform with respect to time, t, is normally used in finding analytical solutions for transient groundwater problems. The behavior of a function at large or small t is known to correspond to that of its Laplace transform counterpart at small or large p, respectively; p is the Laplace transform parameter of t. This condition is generally translated as t being inversely related to p and vice versa. By this relationship many asymptotic solutions for large or small t have been determined from the Laplace domain solutions valid only for small or large p. However, an example is given here which shows this kind of asymptotic calculation may fail to yield correct asymptotic solutions. Hence, the asymptotic calculation must be exercised with care. To deal with this possible failure, the Tauberian theorem is offered to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of functions from their Laplace transform counterparts.

TI A simple scaling model for extreme rainfall
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The simple scaling hypothesis is applied to the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) description of rainfall. It is shown that the cumulative distribution function for the annual maximum series of mean rainfall intensity has a simple scaling property over the range 30 min to 24 hours and in some instances to 48 hours. This behavior is demonstrated through an examination of the scaling properties of the moments and the scaling of the parameters of an extreme value distribution fitted to the data. A simple analytical formula for the IDF relationship is proposed, which embodies the scaling behavior. Once the scaling parameter has been obtained for a gauge or set of gauges in a region, this formula enables the calculation of rainfall amounts, of a chosen return period and duration shorter than a day, directly from the information obtained from the analysis of daily data.

ID LOCAL ADVECTION; SENSIBLE HEAT; TUNDRA SITE; COVERS
AB Much of the snowmelt season is characterized by a patchy surface; differential heating of the snow and snow-free surfaces results in a significant horizontal transport of energy that affects and contributes to the snowmelt. The calculation of the rate of energy advection requires some knowledge of the behaviour of the thermal boundary layer over the patches of snow and snow-free Surfaces. We present the results from a series of field observations of the rate of growth of the thermal boundary layer over snow and snow-free patches. The results confirm that the boundary-layer growth can be described by a power function of the distance from the leading edge of the patch. For the case of the thermal boundary layer over a snow patch within a bare field, the boundary-layer growth is affected by the upwind surface roughness; the thermal boundary layer over a snow patch within a 'rough' field grows much more quickly than that in a 'smooth' field. Relationships are derived and presented for the parameterization of the boundary-layer growth as a function of distance and upwind surface roughness. Copyright (c) 2006 Crown in the right of Canada.

DE WATER TEMPERATURE BEHAVIOR; SEASONAL AND DIEL CYCLES; LONGER-TERM
   TRENDS; AIR-WATER TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIPS
AB Water temperature behaviour in a small upland Exmoor catchment (the Black Ball Stream) has been studied over a 14-year period since January 1976. Results from continuous records revealed annual mean stream temperatures to have a coefficient of variation of less than 5 per cent, and values of 5, 10 and 15-degrees-C to be equalled or exceeded 90, 41.8 and 4 per cent of the time respectively. The annual regime of water temperature was relatively predictable but diel cycles of varying magnitude were superimposed on the seasonal march. A clear seasonal hysteresis was evident whereby diel range in spring exceeded that in autumn by typically more than 2-degrees-C. Trend analysis of monthly temperature time series highlighted the stability of the thermal regime in recent years, although investigation of air water temperature relationships indicated that an increase in mean surface air temperature projected for southwest England by the Year 2050 would result in a rise of mean winter and summer stream temperatures by 1-6 and 1.3-degrees-C respectively. Analysis of streamflow effects on water temperature suggested that future indirect impacts of climatic change on thermal regime via changes in stream discharge are likely to be minor

AB Critical shear stress and unit discharge flow competence models were tested against coarse bed load data from Dupuyer Creek, Montana, United States. Maximum particle sizes sampled (Dmax) and D-50 to D-90 percentiles in the bed load grain size distribution were well correlated with both shear stress and unit discharge. Bed load grain sizes became coarser with increasing flow strength. For the D-max curve, Shields dimensionless parameter for the surface D-50 was estimated at 0.044, and the exponent for relative particle size (D-i/ D-50) was - 0.59. In the unit discharge criterion the critical flow to entrain the surface D50 was poorly predicted. Flow competence relationships based on D-max are prone to the influence of outliers and sample mass variability. The mean of the three largest particles, D-max ( 3), is more sensitive to changes in flow strength than the D-50 to D-90 bed load grain sizes, and may represent a good compromise.

AB Spring systems on the west slope of the Oregon High Cascades exhibit complex relationships among modern topography, lava flow geometries, and groundwater flow patterns. Seven cold springs were continuously monitored for discharge and temperature in the 2004 water year, and they were periodically sampled for delta O-18, delta D, tritium, and dissolved noble gases. Anomalously high unit discharges suggest that topographically defined watersheds may not correspond to aquifer boundaries, and oxygen isotope data reveal that mean recharge elevations for the springs are coincident with extensive Holocene lava fields. The He-3/He-4 ratios in most of the springs are close to atmospheric, implying shallow flow paths, and aquifer thicknesses are estimated to be 30-140 m. Estimates using H-3/He-3 data with exponential and gamma distributions yield mean transit times of similar to 3-14 years. Recharge areas and flow paths are likely controlled by the geographic extent of lava flows, and some groundwater may cross the Cascade crest.

ID LAYERED SOIL COLUMNS; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; WATER-CONTENT; TRANSPORT
AB On the basis of an analysis of the weighting of the bulk electrical conductivity along time domain reflectivity (TDR) probes we show theoretical limitations to the measurement of solute concentrations with TDR. Simple example calculations demonstrate that there will only be a unique relationship between the TDR-measured electrical conductivity and the average solute concentration in the pore water under one of two conditions. First, if the water content is spatially uniform throughout the sample volume of the probe, TDR may be used to determine solute concentrations. Second, if the water content is spatially variable but the spatial distribution is temporally constant and the solute concentration is spatially uniform throughout the probe's sample volume, solute concentrations can be inferred from the electrical conductivity response. Further complications arise in soils with spatially variable porosities or surface electrical conductivities, making TDR unsuited to determining solute concentrations even if one of these conditions is met.

   QUALITY
AB The interesting suggestion by Knight and Tweed (1991) that a link exists between glacier velocity changes and the filling and draining of a marginal ice-dammed lake at Solheimajokull, southern Iceland, is examined. The main problem lies not with plausibility, but with a lack of field data to substantiate the argument. Some pertinent hydrological, glacio-logical and meteorological data from the area are presented here, many of which do not entirely support certain inferences and observations made in their paper. It is shown that this very small lake is likely to have limited quantitative significance in the operation of the glacio-hydrological or solute and sediment transfer systems in this basin. Further, specific, difficulties include the absence of crucial observations on glacier velocity variations and the precise timing and pattern of lake drainage in relation to such velocity changes, the lack of evidence for a significant relationship between precipitation receipt and ice velocity here [a component of the Knight and Tweed (1991) proposition], and the occurrence of the lake drainage event in a rain-free period (contrary to the authors' suggestion). The opportunity is also taken to correct some incidental errors.

AB Urbanisation has been associated with a reduction in the long-term correlation within a streamflow series, quantified by the Hurst exponent (H). This presents an opportunity to use the H exponent as an index for the classification of catchments on a scale from natural to urbanised conditions. However, before using the H exponent as a general index, the relationship between this exponent and level of urbanisation needs to be further examined and verified on catchments with different levels of imperviousness and from different climatic regions. In this study, the H exponent is estimated for 38 (deseasonalised) mean daily runoff time series, 22 from the USA and 16 from Australia, using the traditional rescaled-range statistic (R/S) and the more advanced multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). Relationships between H and catchment imperviousness, catchment size, annual rainfall and specific mean discharge were investigated. No clear relationship with catchment area was found, and a weak negative relationship with annual rainfall and specific mean streamflow was found only when the R/S method was used. Conversely, both methods showed decreasing values of H as catchment imperviousness increased. The H exponent decreased from around 1.0 for catchments in natural conditions to around 0.6 for highly urbanised catchments. Three significantly different ranges of H exponents were identified, allowing catchments to be parsed into groups with imperviousness lower than 5% (natural), catchments with imperviousness between 5 and 15% (peri-urban) and catchments with imperviousness larger than 15% (urban). The H exponent thus represents a useful metric to quantitatively assess the impact of catchment imperviousness on streamflow regime.

ID POROUS-MEDIA
AB The coupled saturated-unsaturated flow that results from a horizontal pressurized water-filled cylindrical cavity is studied, under the assumption of quasilinearization for the unsaturated flow, using a combined boundary element-finite element method.  Earlier work on this problem considered infiltration under hydrostatic pressure alone.  That work is extended here by the inclusion of an additional pressure head in the cavity.  Detailed results are calculated for a range of pressure heads and dimensionless cavity radii, and the size of the saturated region as a function of these two parameters is illustrated.  These show that even for small cavities and comparatively high pressure heads, gravity effects cannot be ignored.  The calculations also reveal a linear relationship between the flux from the cavity and the applied pressure head, with the slope of this line varying approximately as the two-thirds power of the dimensionless cavity radius.

AB A new method is developed for the construction of reliable marginal confidence intervals and joint confidence regions for the parameters of nonlinear, hydrologic regression models. A parameter power transformation is combined with measures of the asymptotic bias and asymptotic skewness of maximum likelihood estimators to determine the transformation constants which cause the bias or skewness to vanish. These optimized constants are used to construct confidence intervals and regions for the transformed model parameters using linear regression theory. The resulting confidence intervals and regions can be easily mapped into the original parameter space to give close approximations to likelihood method confidence intervals and regions for the model parameters. Unlike many other approaches to parameter transformation, the procedure does not use a grid search to find the optimal transformation constants. An example involving the fitting of the Michaelis-Menten model to velocity-discharge data from an Australian gauging station is used to illustrate the usefulness of the methodology.

AB Hydraulic geometry and related analyses are often used to investigate tidal channel geometry and evolution and inform marsh restoration. An alternative approach is presented that avoids calculating tidal prism and allows analysis of additional channel metrics. It relies on scaling relationships between marsh island surface area and various metrics of the set of tidal channels draining each island. In the Skagit Delta marshes (Washington, United States), total channel surface area and length and surface area of the largest channel draining an island scaled disproportionately with island area, suggesting restoration of a 100-ha site would be preferable to restoration of 10 separate 10-ha sites to maximize channel length and area. A model of channel formation through random island conglomeration replicated observed scaling patterns, linking channel scaling to blind channel evolution from river distributaries. Channel size and complexity varied spatially, with significant deficits in an eroding marsh isolated from river distributaries and riverine sediments.

ID HORIZONTAL REDISTRIBUTION; CAPILLARY HYSTERESIS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY;

AB We demonstrate with the help of a numerical simulation model for hysteretic water movement that for horizontal redistribution three types of flow can occur. Raats and Iran Duijn [1995] previously identified these types as a reaction to a specific analysis by Philip [1991]. Depending on the initial conditions in two parts of an infinitely long soil column, there can be no flow, conventional flow from the wet part to the dry part, or unconventional flow from the dry part to the wet part. When flow occurs, the cumulative wetting and cumulative drying both show the expected linear relationship with the square root of time. Hysteresis is described according to the modified dependent domain model of Mualem [1984]. We also indicate that Kool and Parker [1987], who used this model as well, presented a erroneous expression for the differential moisture capacity of the scanning drying curve.

TI Environmental temperature sensing using Raman spectra DTS fiber-optic

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Raman spectra distributed temperature sensing (DTS) by fiber-optic cables has recently shown considerable promise for the measuring and monitoring of surface and near-surface hydrologic processes such as groundwater-surface water interaction, borehole circulation, snow hydrology, soil moisture studies, and land surface energy exchanges. DTS systems uniquely provide the opportunity to monitor water, air, and media temperatures in a variety of systems at much higher spatial and temporal frequencies than any previous measurement method. As these instruments were originally designed for fire and pipeline monitoring, their extension to the typical conditions encountered by hydrologists requires a working knowledge of the theory of operation, limitations, and system accuracies, as well as the practical aspects of designing either short- or long-term experiments in remote or challenging terrain. This work focuses on providing the hydrologic user with sufficient knowledge and specifications to allow sound decisions on the application and deployment of DTS systems.

AB The perfectly stratified aquifer has often been investigated as a simple, tractable model for exploring new theoretical issues in subsurface hydrology. Adopting this approach, we show that steady groundwater flows in the perfectly stratified aquifer are always confined to a set of nonintersecting permanent surfaces, on which both streamlines and vorticity lines lie. This foliation of the flow domain exists as well for steady groundwater flows in any isotropic, spatially heterogeneous aquifer. In the present model example it is a direct consequence of the existence of a stream function, we then demonstrate that tracer plume advection by steady groundwater flow in a perfectly stratified aquifer is never ergodic, regardless of the initial size of the tracer plume. This nonergodicity, which holds also for tracer advection in any isotropic, spatially heterogenous aquifer, implies that stochastic theories of purely advective tracer plume movement err in assuming ergodic behavior to simplify probabilistic calculations of plume spatial concentration moments.

ID MASS-TRANSPORT; POROUS-MEDIA; MODEL; CHEMISTRY
AB A new approach is applied to the problem of modeling solute transport accompanied by many chemical reactions.  The approach, based on concepts of the concentration space and its stoichiometric subspaces, uses elements of the subspaces as primary dependent variables.  It is shown that the resulting model equations are compact in form, isolate the chemical reaction expressions from flow expressions, and can be used for either equilibrium or kinetically controlled reactions.  The implications of the results on numerical algorithms for solving the equations are discussed.  The application of the theory is illustrated throughout with examples involving a simple but broadly representative set of reactions previously considered in the literature.  Numerical results are presented for four interconnected reactions:  a homogeneous complexation reaction, two sorption reactions, and a dissolution/precipitation reaction.  Three cases are considered:  (1) four kinetically controlled reactions, (2) four equilibrium-controlled reactions, and (3) a system with two kinetically controlled reactions and two equilibrium-controlled reactions.

AB The water retention characteristic is one of the fundamental properties that control water movement in unsaturated soils. Because of the complexity and heterogeneity of soil properties, variability and uncertainty of this property has long been a key issue in understanding the relationship between water content and matric pressure. Although considerable progress has been achieved in understanding spatial and local variability, discussions have primarily been based on deterministic analyses. Misleading conclusions can result since the derived variability cannot often be discriminated from uncertainties in model parameters, structure, and observed data. Using a combined deterministic and stochastic analysis, this paper addresses the variability of the retention characteristic in association with the uncertainty of water retention models. Calibrated against two sets of lysimeter data observed over 2 years, the analysis yields insights into the physical changes in the system, and model performance is significantly improved when these effects are explicitly included.

AB The Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) using the Physical Habitat Simulation (PHABSIM) system, has seen increasing application to the assessment of changes in aquatic habitats in the UK over the last 10 years. In particular, the model has been applied operationally to chalk streams (e.g. the Rivers Allen and Piddle) in southern England for the alleviation of low flow (ALF) problems. More recently, the model has also been used to examine the effect of changes in channel morphology upon aquatic habitats, such as those that occur during flood defence, or river channel restoration, schemes. The paper outlines some of the issues related to the application of the model to groundwater dominated rivers, such as chalk streams, and provides examples of the application of the model to a water resource issue and to assess a habitat restoration scheme.
   The paper also reports on three areas of recent research to improve the methodology: (1) choice of representative study sites and habitat variation at the reach and sector scale; (2) modelling of time series and interpretation of alternative water management regimes; and (3) the development of rapid assessment techniques based upon the transfer of standardised relationships bf tween available habitat and discharge.

AB In cold Arctic snowpacks, meltwater retention is a significant factor controlling the timing and magnitude of runoff. Meltwater percolates vertically through the snowpack until it reaches an impermeable horizon, whereupon a saturated zone is established. If the underlying media is below the freezing point, accretive ice formation takes place. This process has previously been crudely parameterized or modelled numerically. Such ice is called either superimposed ice on glaciers or basal ice on bare land.
   Using theory derived from sea-ice formation, an analytical solution to basal ice growth is proposed. Results are compared against growth rates derived from numerical modelling. In addition, model results are compared to field observations of ice temperatures. The analytical solution is further extended to account for the temperature gradient inside the underlying media and the variable thermal properties of the underlying media.
   In the analysis, observations and references have predominantly relied on knowledge from glaciers. However, the process of accretive ice growth is equally important in seasonal snow packs with a cold snow-ground interface and on Arctic sea ice where the ice-snow interface is well below freezing point. The simplification of this accretive ice growth problem makes the solution attractive for incorporation in large-scale cryospheric models. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We studied the problem of local- and field-scale infiltration over a particular class of heterogeneous soils. At the local scale, the soils are described as being vertically non-uniform, with the saturated hydraulic conductivity continuously decreasing with depth according to a power law function. Analogous to the GreenAmpt model, analytical expressions are first developed for local-scale infiltration using a sharp front approximation, and model results are compared with numerical solutions of the Richards equation. These results show that saturation does not occur from below in soils with such vertical non-uniformity, thereby allowing for the use of a sharp front approximation. Because of vertical non-uniformity, ponding conditions are achieved locally even for rainfall rates less than the surface saturated hydraulic conductivity. Furthermore, infiltration rates asymptotically approach zero at long times. To determine field-scale infiltration properties, the spatial variability in the surface saturated hydraulic conductivity is represented by a log-normal random field. Using cumulative infiltration as the independent variable, expressions are developed for the ensemble mean of field-scale infiltration and the expected time for a given depth of water to infiltrate over the field. Surface horizontal heterogeneity is found to control field-scale infiltration at small times, whereas local vertical non-uniformity exerts a strong control at long times.

AB An accurate description of water- or oil-bearing reservoirs strongly depends on a robust determination of their petrophysical parameters, e. g., porosity, permeability and fluid distribution. Downhole logging measurements are the primary means to formation evaluation; however, they do not directly provide the petrophysical properties of interest. To interpret well logging data, a range of empirical models are usually employed. These empirical relationships, however, lack scientific basis and usually represent generalizations of the observed trends. Since macroscopic rock properties vary depending on their microstructure, we suggest using a pore-scale approach to establish links between various petrophysical properties of sedimentary rocks. We outline a method for computing formation permeability using the proposed rock models. The method utilizes NMR ( Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) logging data for the information about porosity and grain size. We also present an approach for prediction of acoustic velocities of model rocks. The proposed methodology is applied to the field data, and the corresponding interpretation results are included in this paper.

AB The present study is aimed at an investigation of the pressure gradient/phase saturation correlation in the flow of an oil-water mixture through a parallel-plate ( single fracture) model. It was found that the correlation depends on the interaction between the two flowing fluids, or flow pattern, which is in turn governed by the injection method, water flow rate, viscosity ratio, fracture aperture, and fracture surface roughness. Three distinct flow patterns were identified, namely, channel, dispersed, and mixed flows. Measurements of pressure gradient and phase saturation suggest that the widely used Romm's relative permeability relationship is applicable to channel flow in which oil and water phases are continuous in the fracture. For dispersed or mixed flow in which either the oil or water phase is discontinuous, a Lockhart-Martinelli type correlation developed for gas-liquid flow in pipes should be valid at low viscosity ratio but not at high viscosity ratio and water flow rate.

AB Discharge hydrographs of rivers carry the cumulated information on the various hydrological processes in catchments and the influences imposed on them. From the analysis of observed baseflow recessions, direct and groundwater flow can be separated and time series of the main components of the underlying groundwater balance, namely discharge, evapotranspiration losses, abstractions, storage and recharge, can be derived. This inverse, or downward, approach was applied to daily streamflow data of rivers in different climate zones (Germany, Western Australia, Turkey) under different influences. The mostly shallow, unconfined aquifers were found to react as nonlinear reservoirs and an appropriate recession function was used instead of the traditional exponential function of the linear reservoir. However, though the actual storage-discharge relationships of aquifers will hardly change, flow recession properties are subject to seasonal variation and changes due to evapotranspiration and other fluxes and abstractions from the groundwater. As demonstrated in the case studies, recession analysis and baseflow separation permits the detection and quantification of these changes. In a separate application, the method is used to identify groundwater flow intruded into leaky sewer lines. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Annual flow duration curves (AFDCs) are used increasingly because unlike traditional period of record flow duration curves (FDCs), they provide confidence intervals for the median AFDC, they enable one to assign return periods to individual AFDCs, and they offer opportunities for developing a generalized stochastic model of daily streamflow. Previous stochastic models of FDCs and AFDCs were unable to reproduce the variance of AFDCs. We introduce an index flow approach to modeling the relationship between an FDC and AFDCs of daily streamflow series, which is able to reproduce the FDC, as well as the mean, median, and variance of the AFDCs without resorting to assumptions regarding the seasonal or persistence structure of daily streamflow series. Our approach offers additional opportunities for the regionalization of flow duration curves and for the generation of time series of daily streamflows at ungauged sites. Our approach is tested on three river basins in eastern central Italy.

AB [1] An analytic framework is developed to model the three-dimensional steady flow generated by wells placed at general nonvertical orientations within a horizontal aquifer. This framework uses closed-form solutions for a distribution of point sinks and point doublets along the centerline of the well and semi-infinite panel elements, each with piecewise linearly varying strengths. This extends previously published implementations and enables a boundary condition of uniform head along the cylindrical face of the well to be accurately matched. The resulting model is used to examine the drawdown and capture zone topology for wells spanning orientations ranging from vertical to horizontal. Scaling relationships are developed for wells perpendicular to flow that are invariant with respect to drawdown and to the strength of elements. The capture zone geometry for such wells is variant with respect to a dimensionless pumping rate, going through transition from two-dimensional flow in a plane perpendicular to the well to two-dimensional flow in a horizontal plane.

AB A semianalytical solution is developed for an equivalent continuum model of one-dimensional steady infiltration in unsaturated fractured rock. The differential form of the mass conservation equation is integrated to yield an analytical expression relating elevation to a function of capillary pressure and relative permeability of the fracture and rock matrix. Constitutive relationships for unsaturated flow in this analysis are taken from van Genuchten [1980] and Mualem [1976], but alternative relations can also be implemented in the integral solution. Expressions are presented for the liquid saturations and pore velocities in the fracture, matrix, and effective continuum materials as a function of capillary pressure and elevation. Results of the analytical solution are applied to examples of infiltration in fractured rock consisting of both homogeneous and composite (layered) domains. The analytical results are also compared to numerical simulations to demonstrate the use of the analytical solution as a benchmarking tool to address computational issues such as grid refinement.

AB A normalized clay-water isotherm model based on BET theory and describing the sorption and desorption of the bound water in clays, sand-clay mixtures, and shales is presented. Clay-water sorption isotherms (sorption and desorption) of clayey materials are normalized by their cation exchange capacity (CEC) accounting for a correction factor depending on the type of counterion sorbed on the mineral surface in the so-called Stern layer. With such normalizations, all the data collapse into two master curves, one for sorption and one for desorption, independent of the clay mineralogy, crystallographic considerations, and bound cation type; therefore, neglecting the true heterogeneity of water sorption/desorption in smectite. The two master curves show the general hysteretic behavior of the capillary pressure curve at low relative humidity (below 70%). The model is validated against several data sets obtained from the literature comprising a broad range of clay types and clay mineralogies. The CEC values, derived by inverting the sorption/adsorption curves using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, are consistent with the CEC associated with the clay mineralogy.

AB The sorption of tetrachloroethylene and trichlorobenzene by a subsurface soil that exhibits moderately nonlinear sorption isotherms for each solute was found to be strongly competitive, while that by a soil for which both solutes exhibit more linear sorption isotherms was essentially additive. The isotherm nonlinearity and competitive sorption observed in the former case suggest that a greater fraction of the sorption by that soil occurred on or within tightly ordered or condensed organic matrices rather than within more amorphous soil organic matter. Ideal adsorbed solution theory was used in conjunction with a Freundlich isotherm in a dual-domain model to characterize mathematically the sorption behavior of these two soils in column-type reactor systems. Model parameters obtained independently from breakthrough curves for single-solute systems were used to predict breakthrough curves for bisolute systems. The results demonstrate that (1) even moderate isotherm nonlinearity can affect breakthrough curve behavior in single-solute systems, and (2) the effects of isotherm nonlinearity on solute breakthrough are significantly increased by the additional manifestation of competitive effects in bisolute systems.

AB Streamflow dynamics for non-perennial networks remain poorly understood. The highly nonlinear unsaturated dynamics associated with the transitions between wetting and drying in non-perennial systems make modelling cumbersome. This has stifled previous modelling attempts and alludes to why there is still a knowledge gap. In this study, we first construct a conceptual model of the physical processes of streamflow generation in an intermittent river system in South Australia, based on the hypothesis that the vertical and longitudinal soil heterogeneity and topography in a basin control short term (fast flows), seasonal (slow flow), and a mixture of these two. We then construct and parameterise a fully integrated surface-subsurface hydrologic model to examine patterns and mechanisms of streamflow generation within the catchment. A set of scenarios are explored to understand the influences of topography and soil heterogeneity across the catchment. The results showed that distinct flow generation mechanisms develop in the three conceptualised areas with marked soil and topographic characteristics and suggested that capturing the order of magnitude for the average hydraulic conductivity of each soil type across the catchment was more important than pinpointing exact soil hydraulic properties. This study augments our understanding of catchment-scale streamflow generation processes, while also providing insight on the challenges of implementing physically based integrated surface-subsurface hydrological models in non-perennial stream catchments.

AB An iterative stochastic approach is developed to estimate transmissivity and head distributions in heterogeneous aquifers. This approach is similar to the classical cokriging technique; it uses a linear estimator that depends on the covariances of transmissivity and hydraulic head and their cross covariance. The linear estimator is, however, improved successively by solving the governing flow equation and by updating the covariances and cross-covariance function of transmissivity and hydraulic head fields in an iterative manner. As a result the nonlinear relationship between transmissivity and head is incorporated in the estimation, and the estimated fields are approximate conditional means. The ability of the iterative approach is tested with some deterministic and stochastic inverse problems. The results show that the estimated transmissivity and hydraulic head fields have smaller mean square errors than those obtained by classical cokriging even in the aquifer with variance of transmissivity up to 3.

AB A portion of the precipitation samples collected and stored by the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) an shown to be useful for analysis of isotopes in precipitation. The potential problems with evaporation are small based on deuterium excess analyses and comparisons with the Global Meteroic Water Line. Presented here are the delta(18)O values of precipitation collected from nine NADP sites during 1989, 1990 and 1991. The trends in the isotopic (delta(18)O) characteristics of recent precipitation are in agreement with findings from previous International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) sites in the USA. The findings are also in agreement with several major isotope-environment relationships, further supporting the use of these samples for a modern global data base on the isotopes in precipitation being developed by IAEA, called GNIP (Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation) and for use by research groups in the hydrological modelling, palaeoclimate and ecological communities.
   As expected, the average delta(18)O values of precipitation that is derived from the Gulf of Mexico (- 3 parts per thousand) and from the Pacific North-west are isotopically distinct (- 7 parts per thousand). In addition, using the NADP network, isotopic depletion in the delta(18)O values of precipitation in the range of 8 parts per thousand was observed from coastal to inland locations either in the Pacific North-west or along the east side of the Rocky Mountains, from Texas to Eastern Montana. In central USA, especially at high elevation, there is a strong seasonal variation in the delta(18)O values of precipitation, differing by almost 25 parts per thousand between January and August, whereas at coastal locations the seasonal variation in the delta(18)O values of precipitation was minimal. Comparisons between the average delta(18)O values of precipitation from several NADP sites and those of the IAEA collected in the 1960s and 1970s are exceptionally comparable, differing in some cases by only 0.1 parts per thousand, further substantiating the quality and utility of precipitation from this network. The delta(18)O-temperature relationships for two of our sites had slopes of 0.55 (Colorado) and 0.46 (Nebraska) that are within the range of those reported earlier (0.29-0.7), although they are slightly lower, possibly owing to the large temperature variation between winter and summer in central USA. Further, the seasonal variation in the delta(18)O values of precipitation are used in a pair of ecological studies to articulate water sources of different plant life forms in riparian and prairie ecosystems, with grasses typically using summer rain to a much greater extent than woody species, such as willow or saltbush.

AB An integrated flow determination algorithm is proposed to calculate the spatial distribution of the topographic index to the channel network. The advantages of a single flow direction algorithm and other multiple flow direction schemes are selectively considered in order to address the drawbacks of existing algorithms. A spatially varying flow apportioning factor is introduced to distribute the contributing area from upslope cells to downslope cells. The channel initiation threshold concept is expanded and integrated into a spatially distributed flow apportioning algorithm to delineate a realistic channel network. The functional relationships between the flow apportioning factors and the expanded channel initiation threshold (ECIT) are developed to address the spatially varied flow distribution patterns considering the permanent channel locations. A genetic algorithm (GA) is integrated into the spatially distributed flow apportioning algorithm (SDFAA) with the objective function of river cell evaluation. An application of a field example suggests that the spatially distributed flow apportioning scheme provides several advantages over the existing approaches; the advantages include the relaxation of overdissipation problems near channel cells, the connectivity feature of river cells and the robustness of the parameter determination procedure over existing algorithms.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID FINE SEDIMENT; REDDS; TRANSPORT; RIVER; BED; STREAMS
AB This paper presents a framework for predicting embryo survival in salmonid spawning gravels as a function of sediment deposition. This framework integrates three quantitative relationships modeling the variations of substrate permeability with sediment deposition, apparent velocity with substrate permeability, and embryo survival rate with apparent velocity. The model allows evaluation of the impacts of sediment deposition on embryo survival. The relative sensitivity of embryo survival to three selected environmental factors is investigated. The model results indicate that embryo survival is most sensitive to the composition of fine sediments (or sediment-gravel size ratio). The maximum influences of the hydraulic pressure head and the length of intragravel flow path are similar to 60 and 35% of the value influenced by size ratio. The proposed model is applied to determine the timing of flushing flows. The results that suggest that the interval between flushing flows should be reduced when higher levels of embryo survival are prescribed or higher near-bed sediment concentrations are imposed.

AB Watershed-scale hydrological and biogeochemical models are usually discretized at resolutions coarser than where significant heterogeneities in topography, abiotic factors (e.g., soil properties), and biotic (e.g., vegetation) factors exist. Here we report on a method to use fine-scale (220m grid cells) hydrological model predictions to build reduced-order models of the statistical properties of near-surface soil moisture at coarse resolution (2(5) times coarser, similar to 7 km). We applied a watershed-scale hydrological model (PAWS-CLM4) that has been previously tested in several watersheds. Using these simulations, we developed simple, relatively accurate (R-2 similar to 0.7-0.8), reduced-order models for the relationship between mean and higher-order moments of near-surface soil moisture during the nonfrozen periods over five years. When applied to transient predictions, soil moisture variance and skewness were relatively accurately predicted (R-2 similar to 0.7-0.8), while the kurtosis was less accurately predicted (R-2 similar to 0.5). We also tested 16 system attributes hypothesized to explain the negative relationship between soil moisture mean and variance toward the wetter end of the distribution and found that, in the model, 59% of the variance of this relationship can be explained by the elevation gradient convolved with mean evapotranspiration. We did not find significant relationships between the time rate of change of soil moisture variance and covariances between mean moisture and evapotranspiration, drainage, or soil properties, as has been reported in other modeling studies. As seen in previous observational studies, the predicted soil moisture skewness was predominantly positive and negative in drier and wetter regions, respectively. In individual coarse-resolution grid cells, the transition between positive and negative skewness occurred at a mean soil moisture of similar to 0.25-0.3. The type of numerical modeling experiments presented here can improve understanding of the causes of soil moisture heterogeneity across scales, and inform the types of observations required to more accurately represent what is often unresolved spatial heterogeneity in regional and global hydrological models.

AB Centrifuge modeling of one-step outflow tests were carried out using a 2-m radius geotechnical centrifuge, and the cumulative outflow and transient pore water pressure were measured during, the tests at multiple gravity levels. Based on the scaling laws of centrifuge modeling, the measurements generally showed reasonable agreement with prototype data calculated from forward simulations with input parameters determined from standard laboratory tests. The parameter optimizations were examined for three different combinations of input data sets using the test measurements. Within the gravity level examined in this study up to 40g, the optimized unsaturated parameters compared well when accurate pore water pressure measurements were included along with cumulative outflow as input data. With its capability to implement variety of instrumentations under well controlled initial and boundary conditions and to shorten testing time, the centrifuge modeling technique is attractive as an alternative experimental method that provides more freedom to set inverse problem conditions for the parameter estimation.

AB Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a widely used technique for measuring soil water content. To examine its applicability to rock, the authors applied TDR to a variety of rocks in the laboratory. The obtained relationships between the apparent dielectric constant and the volumetric water content showed a behavior that can be partly explained by the effect of gaps between the TDR probe and rock. For rocks with an effective porosity smaller than that of soil, the well-known model presented by Topp et al. [1980] for soil tended to overestimate the water content. For such rocks it was determined that an individual calibration was needed for accurate determination of water content. If no experimental calibration is possible, frequently used mixing models may be used to establish the calibration function. Our investigations suggest that TDR showed the potential for measuring the apparent dielectric constant of rock and, further, for determining water content in rock.

TI Annual hysteresis in bed load rating curves
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID BEDLOAD TRANSPORT; STREAM
AB The relationship between flow and bed load transport measured for 10 years in six: gravel-bed streams in Idaho exhibits annual hysteresis. At a given flow rate, more bed load is carried by discharges preceding the first annual occurrence of a "threshold" rate, which is characteristic of each stream. Incorporating the effect of hysteresis leads to a small improvement in the fit of the bed load-flow regression. As the turning point for hysteresis, a constant threshold discharge is found to work better than the annual peak discharge. This bimodal hysteresis model is also found to out perform one with a more gradual transition, based on cumulative discharge. These results are interpreted to reflect a buildup of readily moved sediment supplies during the low-how periods from late summer to early spring, supplies which are then exhausted by rising springtime discharges up to the threshold. The threshold is greater than mean annual discharge and about one-half bank-full discharge.

AB Hydrologic controls on sulfate mobility were investigated in a forested catchment in the Georgia Piedmont using a watershed mass balance approach. Variations in annual sulfate export were governed primarily by differences in runoff rather than by differences in sulfate deposition or in total annual precipitation. However, 2 years with similar total runoff had substantially different sulfate export. A residual analysis indicated that a shift in the concentration-discharge relationship accounted for 72% of the difference in sulfate export and that a change in the pattern of discharge accounted for the remainder of the difference. Stream water sulfate concentrations reflected past hydrologic conditions. Concentrations at the same discharge were higher following an extended dry period than following average periods. The elevation in stream water sulfate concentrations following dry periods persisted for several months. The influence of rainfall patterns on sulfate export underscores the need for long-term records to adequately characterize the acidification status of the watershed and to understand trends in water quality.

AB As an important source of non-rainfall input of land-surface liquid water, dew has considerable ecological and hydrological significance in desert ecosystems. Dew moisture regime is commonly used for characterizing available dew. It discloses not only the contributions of dew to plants, small animals, and biological crusts but also the mechanism by which desert organisms adapt to extreme climates. By reviewing the existing researches on dew moisture regimes in desert ecosystems, this study reveals the variations in the amount and duration of dew, as well as its influencing factors at site-, catchment-, and regional scales, based on the radiation cooling theory and the physical mechanisms of dew formation. Furthermore, it compares the differences in dew moisture between various sites and catchments, illustrates the trends in daily and annual dew moisture in various deserts, and identifies the existing problems of researches on dew moisture regimes amid climate change. The findings of this study enhance preliminary knowledge on the reasonable utilization of dew water, worldwide.

AB Modeling of sediment transport in relation to changing land-surface conditions against a background of considerable natural variability is a challenging area in hydrology. Bayesian dynamic linear models (DLMs) however, offer opportunities to account for non-stationarity in relationships between hydrologic input and basin response variables. Hydrologic data are from a 40 years long record (1951-1990) from the 5905 km(2) Yadkin River basin in North Carolina, USA. DLM regressions were estimated between log-transformed volume-weighted sediment concentration as a response and log-transformed rainfall erosivity and river flow, respectively, as input variables. A similar regression between log-transformed river flow and log-transformed basin averaged rainfall was also analyzed. The dynamic regression coefficient which reflects the erodibility of the basin decreased significantly between 1951 and 1970, followed by a slowly rising trend. These trends are consistent with observed land-use shifts in the basin. Bayesian DLMs represent a substantial improvement over traditional monotonic trend analysis. Extensions to incorporate multiple regression and seasonality are recommended for future applications in hydrology. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the impacts of climate variability upon the regional hydrological regimes of the Yellow River in China. Results indicate that the average annual precipitation is 494.8 rnm in La Nina years and only 408.8 turn in El Nino years. The difference is 86.0 mm, or 18.8% over the long-term average. The stream-flows in the La Nina years are higher than that in El Nino years: 9.2% at the Lan-Zhou station, 9-5% for Tou-Dao-Guai station, 11.8% for Long-Men, 17-6% for San-Men-Xia, 19.2% at the Hua-Yuan-Hou station, and 22.0% at the Li-Jin station. Both precipitation and stream-flow responses show temporal and spatial patterns. The relationship among the stream-flow, precipitation, and temperature, which was obtained by ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst based on observed data, indicates stream-flow is sensitive to both precipitation and temperature. For small precipitation increases (less than 13%), the stream-flow percentage change is less than the precipitation change for the Yellow River. The results of this paper can be used as a reference for watershed water resources planning and management to maintain the healthy life and proper function of the river.

TI Streambed scour and fill in low-order dryland channels
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID BED; GRAVEL; PROBABILITY; DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Distributions of scour and fill depths recorded in three low-order sand bed dryland rivers were compared with the Weibull, gamma, exponential, and lognormal probability density functions to determine which model best describes the reach-scale variability in scour and fill. Goodness of fit tests confirm that the majority of scour distributions conform to the one-parameter exponential model at the 95% significance level. The positive relationship between exponential model parameters and flow strength provides a means to estimate streambed scour depths, at least to a first approximation, in comparable streams. In contrast, the majority of the fill distributions do not conform to the exponential model even though depths of scour and fill are broadly similar. The disparities between the distributions of scour and fill raise questions about notions of channel equilibrium and about the role of scour and fill in effecting channel change.

TI Does non-stationarity induced by multiyear drought invalidate the

AB Multiyear drought has been demonstrated to cause non-stationary rainfall-runoff relationship. But whether this change can occur in catchments that have also experienced vegetation change and whether it invalidates the most widely used methods for estimating impacts of vegetation change - i.e., the paired-catchment method (PCM), the time-trend method (TTM), and the sensitivity-based method (SBM) - on runoff is still unknown and rarely discussed. Estimated inconsistent afforestation impacts were 32.8 %, 93.5 %, and 76.1 % of total runoff changes in the Red Hill paired experimental catchments in Australia during the period of 1990-2015 by the PCM, TTM, and SBM, respectively. In addition to afforestation, the Red Hill paired experimental catchments have experienced a 10-year drought (2000-2009) and have been demonstrated to lead to non-stationary rainfall-runoff relationships of paired catchments. Estimated impacts of vegetation change by the PCM (32.8 %) is still reliable and is not invalided by multiyear drought-induced non-stationarity, because the PCM can eliminate all impacts by different factors on paired catchments (multiyear drought and climate variability), except the purposed treatment (afforestation). For the TTM and SBM, traditional application did not further differentiate different drivers of non-stationary rainfall-runoff relationship (i.e., multiyear drought and vegetation change), which led to significant overestimation of afforestation effects. A new framework was further proposed to separate the effects of three factors on runoff changes, including vegetation change, climate variability, and hydroclimatic non-stationarity (i.e., multiyear drought). Based on the new framework, impacts of multiyear drought and climate variability on runoff of the control catchment (Kileys Run) were 87.2 % and 12.8 %, respectively. Impacts of afforestation, multiyear drought, and climate variability on runoff of the treated catchment (Red Hill) were 32.8 %, 54.7 %, and 23.9 %, respectively. Impacts of afforestation on runoff were 38.8 % by the TTM and 21.4 % by the SBM, agreeing well with that by the PCM (32.8 %). This study not only demonstrated that multiyear drought can induce non-stationary rainfall-runoff relationship using field observations, but also proposed a new framework to better separate the impact of vegetation change on runoff under climate-induced non-stationary condition. More importantly, it is shown that non-stationarity induced by multiyear drought does not invalidate the PCM, and PCM is still the most reliable method even though the control catchment experienced climate-induced shift in the rainfall-runoff relationship.

AB The separation of baseflow is an important issue in hydrology. The objective of this paper is to develop a new baseflow separation method based on the Horton infiltration capacity curve. For this purpose, the mathematical expressions of three parameters for the Horton infiltration capacity curve were derived in terms of rainfall and runoff data, and the lag time of the effective rainfall in the unsaturated zone and the groundwater flow routing equation are also presented. With these equations, the baseflow hydrographs at the outlet of the basin can be separated. The flow chart of the proposed method for baseflow hydrograph separation is given. Three recent baseflow separation methods, i.e. digital filter, non-linear reservoir and the Boussinesq equation, were chosen as parallel schemes to compare with the proposed method. Rainfall-runoff data from four watersheds located in different climatic regions in China were selected and used as case studies. Test and application results indicate that the proposed baseflow hydrograph separation method is in accordance with the hydrological physical process. The proposed method is comparable with current available methods and reduces some of the subjective aspects for the rising limb of the baseflow hydrograph, and it is useful for unit hydrograph analysis and for the study of the rainfall-runoff relationship.

AB Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) recommends, among other things, that the management of water resources systems be carried out at the lowest appropriate level in order to increase the transparency, acceptability and efficiency of the decision-making process. Empowering water users and stakeholders transforms the decision-making process by enlarging the number of point of views that must be considered as well as the set of rules through which decisions are taken. This paper investigates the impact of different group decision-making approaches on the operating policies of a water resource. To achieve this, the water resource allocation problem is formulated as an optimization problem which seeks to maximize the aggregated satisfaction of various water users corresponding to different approaches to collective choice, namely the utilitarian and the egalitarian ones. The optimal operating policies are then used in simulation and compared. The concepts are illustrated with a multipurpose reservoir in Chile. The analysis of simulation results reveals that if this reservoir were to be managed by its water users, both approaches to collective choice would yield significantly different operating policies. The paper concludes that the transfer of management to water users must be carefully implemented if a reasonable trade-off between equity and efficiency is to be achieved.

AB As residential development, on-site wastewater disposal, and groundwater contamination increase in the coastal zone, assessment of nutrient removal by soil and sedimentary processes becomes increasingly important. Nitrogen removal efficiency depends largely on the specific flow paths taken by groundwater as it discharges into nitrogen-limited estuarine waters. Shoreline salinity surveys, hydraulic studies, and thermal infrared imagery indicated that groundwater discharge into the Nauset Marsh estuary (Eastham, Massachusetts) occurred in high-velocity seeps immediately seaward of the upland-fringing salt marsh. Discharge was highly variable spatially and occurred through permeable, sandy sediments during low tide. Seepage chamber monitoring showed that dissolved inorganic nitrogen (principally nitrate) traversed nearly conservatively from the aquifer through shallow estuarine Sediments to coastal waters at flux rates of 1-3 mmol m(-2) h(-1). A Significant relationship between pore water NO3-N concentrations and NO3-N flux rates may provide a rapid method of estimating nitrogen loading from groundwater to the water column.

AB A water-saturated fracture, partially clogged with porous material coating the fracture surfaces, is considered.  Fluid flow and contaminant transport in this fracture are significantly altered relative to an unclogged fracture.  Analytical expressions are developed for the water velocities in the clogged and the unclogged regions in the fracture and the asymptotic longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the system.  For highly adsorbing dissolved contaminants or large colloids, the slow diffusion within the porous region causes enhanced dispersion.  In a standard tracer test, colloidal contaminants will arrive earlier than dissolved tracers for either one of two reasons:  (1) colloids confined to the unclogged portion of the fracture will have a larger average velocity or (2) colloids that can diffuse into the porous region have very low Brownian diffusivities, resulting in a large longitudinal dispersion due to the inverse relationship between Taylor dispersion and Brownian diffusion.  The average velocity or asymptotic longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be orders of magnitude greater than that for a molecular tracer.

ID PORE; CONDUCTIVITY
AB Structure, meaning a nonrandom arrangement of pores or pore domains, is present in many geologic porous media. We examined the effects of different nonrandom arrangements of the pore domains containing the largest pores on the percolation and flow properties of a simulated porous medium. Increasing the length of clusters (structural elements), or the fraction of the pore space occupied by them, decreases the percolation threshold (air entry value) and increases the permeability. Decreasing the internal homogeneity of clusters decreases the extent of their effects on percolation and permeability. Percolation threshold is not affected by the ratio between cluster length and network size as long as the cluster length is less than two thirds the network size. All cluster shapes display a similar relationship between percolation threshold and permeability, seen also in geologic porous media. The air entry value is a parameter that could potentially quantify both the degree of structure of a medium and its saturated permeability.

ID POROUS-MEDIA; PRESSURE; PERMEABILITY; DIFFUSION; SOLIDS
AB This paper presents an array of deformation-dependent flow models of various porosities and permeabilities relevant to the characterization of naturally fractured reservoirs. A unified multiporosity multipermeability formulation is proposed as a generalization of the porosity- or permeability-oriented models of specific degree. Some new relationships are identified in the parametric investigation for both single-porosity and dual-porosity models. A formula is derived to express Skempton's constant B by Biot's coefficient H and relative compressibility phi*. It is found that the recovery of the original expression for Skempton's constant B is largely dependent on the choice of phi*, representing relative compressibility. The dual-porosity/dual-permeability model is evaluated through an alternative finite element approximation. The deformation-dependent fracture flow mechanism is introduced where the rock matrix possesses low permeability and fracture flow is dominant. A preliminary study of the reservoir simulation identifies the strong coupling between the fluid flow and solid deformation.

AB Previously, soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves have been scaled independently with separate scale factors calculated for each curve. Here we provide a method to scale both hydraulic functions simultaneously to yield a single set of scaling factors. An algorithm was developed to scale the hydraulic data, either as a function of degree of saturation S, or normalized water content-THETA. Optimization using Powell's method in combination with a Newton-Raphson procedure resulted in one set of parameters representing the scaled mean hydraulic functions and one set of scale factors describing the variability of both the retention and conductivity relationships. We present and compare results obtained from (1) scaling water retention data only; (2) scaling hydraulic conductivity data only; (3) simultaneous scaling of soil water pressure head h and the natural logarithm of hydraulic conductivity K; and (4) simultaneous scaling of the logarithms of both h and K. Sets of scale factors for two data sets were analyzed for distribution type and autocorrelation.

AB Two adjacent subcatchments on soils with very strong texture contrast between the A soil horizons (sandy loam texture) and B soil horizons (clay texture) in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia were instrumented to collect overland and subsurface flow from dairy pasture. Subcatchments were defined by exclusion drains in the upper reaches and stainless steel barriers at the lower boundary. Water samples were analysed for 20 different chemical fractions. Chemical loads were examined in order to determine relationships among simple empirical event and site characteristics, and between chemical fractions. All but five of the chemical fractions could be separated into one of two clear groups using a statistical technique based on the magnitude of simple correlation coefficients. The two groups consisted of either dissolved or particulate fractions. The clear separation into these groups is consistent with the majority of chemical fractions moving from pasture by one of only two processes. Simple empirical variables in a multiple regression explained a high proportion of variation in chemical loads in runoff water. These findings may have major implications in the modelling and prediction of chemical loads in runoff from agricultural catchments and the setting of environmental limits, in simplifying chemical loss predictions by adding a nutrient loss module to runoff volume predictions.

AB Inspired by a quotation from Howard Cook in 1946, this paper traces the evolution of the infiltration theory of runoff from the work of Robert Horton and LeRoy Sherman in the 1930s to the early digital computer models of the 1970s and 1980s. The reasons for the popularity of the infiltration theory are considered and its impact on the way in which hydrological responses were perceived by several generations of hydrologists. Reconsideration of the perceptual model for many catchments, partly as a result of the greater appreciation of the contribution of subsurface flows to the hydrograph indicated by tracer studies, suggests a more precise utilisation of hydrological terms and, in particular, that the use of runoff and surface runoff should be avoided.

AB In the framework of simplified water balance models devoted to irrigation scheduling or crop modelling, the relative transpiration rate (the ratio of actual to maximal transpiration) is assumed to decrease linearly when the soil dries out below a critical available water value. This value is usually expressed as a fraction, F, of the maximal available soil water content. The present work aims to use the basic laws governing water transfer through the plants at a daily time step to compute F dynamically as the crop grows. It can be regarded as an expansion of Slabbers' (1980) approach to crop growing conditions. Starting from the mathematical representation given by single-root models (Gardner, 1960), an analytical expression for F is derived, using simplified hypotheses. This expression accounts for plant attributes such as the mean root radius, the critical leaf water potential for stomatal closure and the root length density profile growing with the crop. Environmental factors such as soil type and atmospheric demand also influence F. The structural influence of soil comes from the required introduction of the bulk soil hydraulic conductivity in the single-root model. The shape of the root length density profile is assumed to be sigmoidal and a new profile is calculated at each value of the rooting depth. A sensitivity analysis of F to all those factors is presented. The first general result is that F decreases as the root system grows in depth. Differences in the shape of the root profile can be responsible for differential water stress sensitivity in the early stages of growth. Yet, low critical leaf water potential can compensate partially for a poor root profile. Conversely, F is relatively insensitive to the average root radius. F sensitivity to soil type seems somewhat artificial: given the bulk soil hydraulic conductivity formula, the soil sensitivity results from F being expressed as a fraction of the maximal available soil water content. The atmospheric demand together with the rooting depth appear as the most important factors. However, when assuming predictable climatic and crop evolution, compensation occurs between those two effects leading to a relative stability of F when the crop is fully developed. Though relying on well-known physical laws, the present approach remains in the framework of single layer models with the same limitations.

AB Monte Carlo studies of flow and transport in two-dimensional synthetic conductivity fields are employed to evaluate first-order flow and Eulerian transport theories. Hydraulic conductivity is assumed to obey fractional Brownian motion (fBm) statistics with infinite integral scale or to have an exponential covariance structure with finite integral scale. The flow problem is solved via a block-centered finite difference scheme, and a random walk approach is employed to solve the transport equation for a. conservative tracer. The model is tested for mass conservation and convergence of computed statistics and found to yield accurate results. It is then used to address several issues in the context of flow and transport. The validity of the ist-order relation between the fluctuating velocity covariance and the fluctuating log conductivity is examined. The simulations show that for exponential covariance, this approximation is justified in the mean flow direction for log conductivity variance, sigma(f)(2), of the order of unity. However, as sigma(f)(2) increases, the relation for the transverse velocity component deviates from the fully nonlinear Monte Carlo results: Eulerian transport models neglect triplet correlation functions that appear in the nonlocal macroscopic flux. The relative importance of the triplet correlation term for conservative chemicals is examined. This term appears to be small relative to the convolution flux term in mildly heterogeneous media. As sigma(f)(2) increases or the integral scale grows, the triplet correlation becomes significant. In purely convective transport the triplet correlation term is significant if the heterogeneity is evolving. The exact nonlocal macroscale flux for the purely convective case significantly differs from that of the convective-dispersive transport. This is in agreement with recent theoretical analysis and numerical studies, and it suggests that neglecting local-scale dispersion may lead to large errors. Localization errors in the flux term are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. The nonlocal in time model significantly differs from the fully nonlocal model. For small variance and integral scale there is a slight difference between the fully localized flux and the fully nonlocal convolution flux. This is also in agreement with recent theories that suggest that moments through the second for the two models are nearly identical for conservative tracers. The fully localized model does not perform well in the purely convective cases.

ID RECHARGE; WATER; FLOW
AB M. S. Hantush established relationships between the dynamics of groundwater mounding beneath recharge zones and two integral functions, M and S. Exact algebraic expressions for these functions are developed in terms of a formal power series expansion. This expansion may be reordered to provide two independent analytical partial summations involving elementary functions. The convergence characteristics of these two formulae are discussed and compared with numerical quadratures of M and, hence, S. The algebraic expressions are used to generate identities for related integrals. Compact algebraic approximations to M and S can be deduced from the series expansions with essentially arbitrary accuracy, while retaining valuable functional information. For example, a simple two-term truncated sum yields a reasonable approximation to M over a useful range of arguments. The results are amenable for use in further theoretical studies of groundwater percolation and mounding where numerical quadratures may be undesirable.

AB [1] Drinking water used by the population of French Guiana comes mostly from rivers and can induce major health impacts. Consequently, groundwaters are being studied in terms of an alternative drinking water supply. In this context, boron isotopes were applied to the coastal aquifers to better constrain the water-rock interactions. We found that the delta(11)B signatures vary between -2.98 and 49.35parts per thousand in the groundwaters and between 36.35 and 42.41parts per thousand in the river waters and that the local seawater gave a value of 40.76parts per thousand. We also noted an inverse correlation between groundwater pH and delta(11)B: this relationship, previously demonstrated experimentally, is particularly well defined in the French Guiana coastal aquifer because of the wide pH range (4.18 to 7.64) naturally present in the groundwaters. It would appear that the variations in delta(11)B values are linked to water-rock interaction processes (e.g., dissolution/precipitation of silicates).

DE braided rivers; scaling; self-similar; self-affine
AB [1] The dimensions of islands in seven braided river reaches are analyzed as an indicator of the scaling behaviour of braided channels at small scales. We examined the relationship, W L H, where L and W are island length and width which are measured along the major and minor axes respectively and H is Hurst's exponent, which is a measure of scaling anisotropy. Islands are shown to exhibit near isotropic scaling (H = 0.88-1.02), or self-similarity, at length scales up to 1.5 times the braid plain width, with reasonable consistency occurring between all reaches studied despite large differences in scaling and hydrologic/geomorphologic characteristics. We suggest that previous conclusions that braided channels show more strongly self-affine scaling behavior have been influenced by the inappropriate application of simple linear regression and by basing morphological feature dimensions on their projection parallel and orthogonal to the braid plain axis rather than in terms of their absolute (major axis) dimensions.

AB The main purpose of this study was to examine the hydrogeochemical factors leading to nitrate contamination of shallow groundwater in an agricultural area. Another purpose was to identify relationships between variations in organic matter levels (as estimated by the BOD and COD parameters) of groundwater that transports effluent from small-scale livestock holdings. Major cations, anions, BOD and COD of organic matter and total coliforms were analysed. It was found that groundwaters beneath cultivated areas and areas carrying livestock had higher concentrations of calcium, nitrate and chloride than did freshwater. Above all, the nitrification process increased concentrations of nitrate. Nitrate levels were depressed in some places where the groundwater was low in dissolved oxygen. Groundwaters affected by livestock activities showed high concentrations of organic matter (BOD, COD) and high microbial concentrations (as indicated by total coliforms). The COD/BOD ratio increased in the downward direction. It was inferred that this was due to the faster loss of easily biodegradable organic matter compared with non-biodegradable organic matter proceeding away from a discharge. Accordingly, it is possible to trace effluent in a small area back to a point source by monitoring the COD/BOD ratio of groundwater. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB A series of experiments designed to study the separation of how components from two large undisturbed cores under steady-state rainfall (downward) and return (upward) hows under near-saturated conditions is summarized. The experiments were conducted on soil columns collected from Lancaster University and the Slapton Wood catchment, Devon. The use of the relatively conservative tracers, potassium bromide, o-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid and 2,6-difluorobenzoic acid and a combination of application rates made it possible to quantify the different sources of water contributing to the discharge hydrographs. There is significant retention of tracer within the cores, despite the application of several pore volumes of water.
   The use of steady flow conditions allowed the determination of dispersion coefficients, dispersivity and proportion of 'mobile' water content parameters of the advection-dispersion equation. It was found that there were significant differences between the dispersivities at different flow-rates under upward and downward flux conditions and that in the undisturbed cores studied here the apparent proportions of mobile pore water ranged between 0.33 and 1.0, with an apparently complex relationship to flux rate. Prediction of transport in undisturbed soil remains problematic and tracer experiments will continue to be needed to provide a fundamental understanding of the complex flow processes involved.

ID FLOOD FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTION; DERIVATION; SIMILARITY
AB The peak discharge rate of a runoff event is estimated from the runoff event volume, the duration of the causal rainfall event, and the catchment time of concentration. The runoff event Volume is determined from the rainfall-runoff relationship developed by GLIO and Adams [this issue]. The average catchment time of concentration is used for all runoff events and is treated as a physical characteristic of the urban catchment, independent of input rainfall characteristics. Incorporating the exponential probability density functions of rainfall event characteristics, closed-form analytical expressions are then derived for the return period of peak discharge rate or flood frequency distribution of urban catchments. The derived flood frequency distributions compared favorably with sample distributions constructed from continuous simulation results for a range of urban catchments. Thus the derived analytical expressions or probabilistic models for peak discharge rates are proposed as an alternative to simulation modeling or regional analyses for the determination of flood frequencies for urban catchments.

TI A LINEAR CONCEPTUAL SUBSURFACE STORM FLOW MODEL
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A zero-dimensional (lumped), linear conceptual model of the subsurface storm flow from hillslopes has been developed by integrating, over the length of the hillslope, the linearized one-dimensional (Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation) discharge relationship for saturated flow over an inclined plane.  The derived two-term storage function accounts for gravity- and gradient-driven flow.  Coupled with the storage balance equation for the plane, the model allows direct, analytical computation of the outflow hydrograph at the foot of the hill in response to an infiltration step input.  The model is the conceptual counterpart of the linear advection-diffusion (LAD) flow equation derived from the extended Boussinesq equation through linearization.  In contrast to the kinematic wave approximation, the outflows normalized by their equilibrium values are properly given as functions of the infiltration rate.  The outflow hydrographs computed by the conceptual LAD model approximate nonlinear behavior closely over a wide range of conditions encountered in field applications.

AB We used a mobile bed flume with scaled grain size distribution, channel geometry, and flow to examine morphology and hydraulics of stepped channels. We hypothesized that (1) step geometry and flow resistance differs significantly as a function of the range of grain sizes present, (2) a transition from nappe to skimming flow occurs in stepped channels with mobile beds for conditions similar to stepped spillways, and (3) the partitioning of flow resistance changes significantly when flow passes from nappe to skimming conditions. Results support each of these hypotheses and help to illuminate the complexity of V-Q relationships in stepped channels, in which a dramatic decrease in flow resistance and increase in velocity accompany the transition from nappe to skimming flow near step-forming events. Therefore, a single flow resistance equation applicable to both ordinary and large floods may not be ideal in stepped channels. Nonetheless, models based on dimensionless velocity and unit discharge appear more robust compared to those based on the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

AB A knowledge of the area-averaged latent heat flux [lambda E] is necessary to validate large-scale model predictions of heat fluxes over heterogeneous land surfaces. This paper describes different procedures to obtain [lambda E] as a weighted average of ground-based observations. The weighting coefficients are obtained from remote sensing measurements. The remote sensing data used in this study consist of a Landsat thematic mapper image of the European Field Experiment in a Desertification-Threatened Area (EFEDA) grid box in central Spain, acquired on June 12, 1991. A newly developed remote sensing algorithm, the surface energy balance for land algorithm (SEBAL), solves the energy budget on a pixel-by-pixel basis, From the resulting frequency distribution of the latent heat flux, the area-averaged latent heat flux was calculated as [lambda E] = 164 W m(-2). This method was validated with field measurements of latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, and soil moisture. In general, the SEBAL-derived output compared well with field measurements. Two other methods for retrieval of weighting coefficients were tested against SEBAL. The second method combines satellite images of surface temperature, surface albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) into an index on a pixel-by-pixel basis. After inclusion of ground-based measurements of the latent heat flux, a linear relationship between the index and the latent heat flux was established. This relationship was used to map the latent heat flux on a pixel-by-pixel basis, resulting in [lambda E] = 194 W m(-2). The third method makes use of a supervised classification of the thematic mapper image into eight land use classes. An average latent heat flux was assigned to each class by using field measurements of the latent heat flux. According to the percentage of occurrence of each class in the image, [lambda E] was calculated as 110 W m(-2). A weighting scheme was produced to make an estimation of [lambda E] possible from in situ observations, The weighting scheme contained a multiplication factor for each measurement site in order to compensate for the relative contribution of that site to [lambda E], It was shown that [lambda E] derived as the arithmetic mean of 13 individual in situ observations leads to a difference of 34% ([lambda E] = 104 W m(-2)), which emphasizes the need for improved weighting procedures.

AB The hydrologic community has experienced a surge in interest in machine learning in recent years. This interest is primarily driven by rapidly growing hydrologic data repositories, as well as success of machine learning in various academic and commercial applications, now possible due to increasing accessibility to enabling hardware and software. This overview is intended for readers new to the field of machine learning. It provides a non-technical introduction, placed within a historical context, to commonly used machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures. Applications in hydrologic sciences are summarized next, with a focus on recent studies. They include the detection of patterns and events such as land use change, approximation of hydrologic variables and processes such as rainfall-runoff modeling, and mining relationships among variables for identifying controlling factors. The use of machine learning is also discussed in the context of integrated with process-based modeling for parameterization, surrogate modeling, and bias correction. Finally, the article highlights challenges of extrapolating robustness, physical interpretability, and small sample size in hydrologic applications.

AB The impact of droughts on vegetation is essentially manifested asthe transition of water shortage from the meteorological to ecologicalstages. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of drought propagation frommeteorological to ecological drought is crucial for ecological conservation. This study proposes a method for calculating the probability of meteorological drought to trigger ecological drought at different magnitudes in northwestern China. In this approach, meteorological and ecological drought events during 1982-2020 are identified using the three-dimensional identification method; the propagated drought events are extracted according to a certain spatiotemporal overlap rule, and propagation probability is calculated by coupling the machine learning model and C-vine copula. The results indicate that (1) 46 drought events are successfully paired with 130 meteorological and 184 ecological drought events during 1982-2020, and ecological drought exhibits a longer duration but smaller affected area and severity than meteorological drought; (2) a quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier performs the best among the 11 commonly used machine learning models which are combined with four-dimensional C-vine copula to construct the drought propagation probability model; and (3) the hybrid method considers more drought characteristics and a more detailed propagation process which addresses the limited applicability of the traditional method to regions with large spatial extent.

AB The univariate flood frequency analysis is widely used in hydrological studies. Often only flood peak or flood volume is statistically analyzed. For a more complete analysis the three main characteristics of a flood event i.e. peak, volume and duration are required. To fully understand these variables and their relationships, a multivariate statistical approach is necessary. The main aim of this paper is to define the trivariate probability density and cumulative distribution functions. When the joint distribution is known, it is possible to define the bivariate distribution of volume and duration conditioned on the peak discharge. Consequently volume-duration pairs, statistically linked to peak values, become available. The authors build trivariate joint distribution of flood event variables using the fully nested or asymmetric Archimedean copula functions. They describe properties of this copula class and perform extensive simulations to highlight differences with the well-known symmetric Archimedean copulas. They apply asymmetric distributions to observed flood data and compare the results those obtained using distributions built with symmetric copula and the standard Gumbel Logistic model.

AB The flow records ol'arid zone rivers are characterised by a high degree of seasonal variability, being dominated by long periods of very low or zero flow. Discrete flow events in these rivers are influenced by aseasonal Factors such as global climate forcings. The atmospheric circulations of the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have been shown to influence climate regimes across many parts of the world. Strong teleconnections between changing ENSO regimes and discharges are likely to be observed in highly variable arid zones. In this paper, the influence of ENSO mechanisms on the flow records of two arid zone rivers in each of Australia and Southern Africa are identified. ENSO signals, together with multi-decadal variability in their impact as identified through seasonal values of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (1PO) index, are shown to influence both the rate of occurrence and the size of discrete flow episodes in these rivers.

TI Bivariate extreme value distributions: An application of the Gibbs
   sampler to the analysis of floods
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIVARIATE
AB The quantitative definition of the magnitude of a flood episode exclusively in terms of its peak rate of discharge is often insufficient. In common with most episodic hydrological phenomena, floods are intrinsically multivariate random events, characterized not only by their peak flow, but also by their volume and the duration of discharge above critical thresholds. A complete definition in terms of these three component random variables has not found its way into standard analytical practice. This may be partly because the theory of multivariate extremes is not straightforward, and partly because no intuitively attractive way of presenting the component variables in a probabilistic framework has been put forward. We propose that the Gibbs sampler, a member of the new generation of computer intensive methods in computational statistics, bypasses the theoretical difficulties. We demonstrate the Gibbs sampler, and provide graphical presentations of the results, for the annual flood hydrograph on the Mekong River at Vientiane, Laos. We extend the results to evaluate the potential distribution of flood damage to the city.

AB Analysis is performed of a 20-month natural gradient tracer study in the saturated zone of a highly heterogeneous aquifer. Graphical presentation of concentration distributions versus time and spatial moments analysis reveal dramatically non-Gaussian behavior and a systematic mass loss. Implications of the mass loss on plume moments is analyzed through sensitivity studies. The moments data are interpreted by applying two simple models: (1) pure advection from a continuous source, and (2) advection plus dispersion in a converging nonuniform flow field. A longitudinal dispersivity of 5-10 m is estimated from the latter model and is somewhat larger than the value of about 1.5 m calculated by Rehfeldt et al. (this issue) using the stochastic theory of Gelhar and Axness (1983) based on independent measurements of the spatial variation of hydraulic conductivity. The dispersivity of 5-10 m is an order of magnitude larger than values measured at recently studied field sites (Borden and Cape Cod) with less heterogeneity, but an order of magnitude lower than would be computed from the moments data if the flow is presumed to be uniform.

AB Ground subsidence of detrital deposits in the Almeria basin (SE Spain) was studied using the remote sensing technique of Differential Interferometry SAR (DInSAR). This basin is one of the most arid in Europe, receiving an average rainfall of 250 mm per year. Over the last 60 years the region has experienced an enormous agricultural and urban expansion, whose water demand has been largely supplied from groundwater, leading to the current situation of overexploitation of water resources. This paper outlines the likely relationship between groundwater abstraction and subsidence. To this end, 34 ERS and Envisat images, taken between 2003 and 2009, were analysed to estimate ground surface deformations, and hence, compared with water table variations measured in a number of piezometers in the basin. The analysis shows a clear parallelism between the variations in piezometric level and deformation of the ground surface. In addition, the zones of greatest subsidence coincide with those areas where groundwater abstractions are concentrated. Subsidence over the examined period varies from 10 to 30 mm, with extreme values as high as 50 mm, which translates to a rate of between 1.7 and 5 mm/year, reaching maximum rates of 8 mm/year at some points. Given such subsidence rates, damage to urban infrastructures are, for the moment, incipient. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID GLACIER
AB For a better management of water resources, the information on water stored in a basin in the form of snow is of immense use. Changes in the snow water storage with time influence the recession characteristics of the hydrographs. Recession is found to be slower in a basin when it contains higher snow water storage and becomes faster as the volume of stored water reduces. In other words, the recession coefficient is not constant throughout the melt season, it changes with time. In the present study, the possibility of assessing snow water storage at any time during the melt season using recession coefficients is examined. The hydrograph analyses have been made for the Glatzbach watershed in the Hohe Tauern region of the Austrian Alps. For this purpose, a relationship between snow water storage and the recession coefficients is developed. This study suggests a simple and useful approach to assess the snow water storage in a basin at any time during the snowmelt season. The information on the snow water storage of a basin can be obtained using a readily derived single parameter, the recession coefficient. The results are based on limited data, but they are sufficient to illustrate how the changes in snow water storage control the recession characteristics of the hydrographs. These investigations set the pace for further research in this area. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this study, we demonstrated that the residence time of seawater in Tokyo bay, Japan, has changed over time because of fresh water imported from neighbouring catchments and reclamation of portions of the bay. The residence time of seawater was estimated from data collected in 2002, and compared with re-estimates of the residence time based on data from 1947 to 1974. We also used a numerical model to examine the effects of changes in the freshwater input and in the surface area of the bay on the seawater residence time. Our analysis showed that the seawater residence time decreased by 35% from the period prior to 2002. The effects of the increase in freshwater input and the decrease in the sea surface area over this period on the decrease in residence time were almost the same. Eighty percent of the increase in freshwater input resulted from water imported from neighbouring catchment areas. In terms of the relationship between seawater residence time and water quality, the effects of the imported fresh water were almost the same as those of bay reclamation.

AB The surface area to mass ratio or specific surface area (SSA) is an often neglected characteristic of the snowpack that varies substantially with time, and with the shape of the individual snow crystal for fresh snow. The SSA for the dendritic shape of snow crystals was computed using a series of images photographed by W. A. Bentley. The specific images were dendritic crystals (P1d, P1e, P1f) and crystals that take a partial dendritic form and have ends or extensions (P2a, P2b, P2d, P2e, P2f, P2g) according to the Magono and Lee snow crystal classification. Image analysis, using known geometric relationships between length and width, and particle size distributions, examined the spatial properties of 50 sample snow crystals. Probability distribution functions were derived for SSA and these compared well with measured and other computed estimates of fresh snow SSA. For the non-rimed condition, the average SSA was 0.182 m(2)/g with a range from 0.09 to 0.33 m(2)/g. The presence of rime is discussed, and depending on the shape of the rime particles and the degree of surface coverage, the SSA can be doubled (20% coverage for needle or plate shaped rime). Fractal analysis was performed to determine various geometric relationships that characterize the dendritic form of snow crystal. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB It is increasingly acknowledged that, in order to sustainably manage global freshwater resources, it is critical that we better understand the nature of human-hydrology interactions at the broader catchment system scale. Yet to date, a generic conceptual framework for building models of catchment systems that include adequate representation of socioeconomic systems - and the dynamic feedbacks between human and natural systems - has remained elusive. In an attempt to work towards such a model, this paper outlines a generic framework for models of socio-hydrology applicable to agricultural catchments, made up of six key components that combine to form the coupled system dynamics: namely, catchment hydrology, population, economics, environment, socioeconomic sensitivity and collective response. The conceptual framework posits two novel constructs: (i) a composite socioeconomic driving variable, termed the Community Sensitivity state variable, which seeks to capture the perceived level of threat to a community's quality of life, and acts as a key link tying together one of the fundamental feedback loops of the coupled system, and (ii) a Behavioural Response variable as the observable feedback mechanism, which reflects land and water management decisions relevant to the hydrological context. The framework makes a further contribution through the introduction of three macroscale parameters that enable it to normalise for differences in climate, socioeconomic and political gradients across study sites. In this way, the framework provides for both macroscale contextual parameters, which allow for comparative studies to be undertaken, and catchment-specific conditions, by way of tailored "closure relationships", in order to ensure that site-specific and application-specific contexts of sociohydrologic problems can be accommodated. To demonstrate how such a framework would be applied, two socio-hydrological case studies, taken from the Australian experience, are presented and the parameterisation approach that would be taken in each case is discussed. Preliminary findings in the case studies lend support to the conceptual theories outlined in the framework. It is envisioned that the application of this framework across study sites and gradients will aid in developing our understanding of the fundamental interactions and feedbacks in such complex human-hydrology systems, and allow hydrologists to improve social-ecological systems modelling through better representation of human feedbacks on hydrological processes.

AB A distributed 1D rainfall-runoff model is presented. It consists of the Saint Venant continuity and momentum equations for overland flow and a modified Green-Ampt model for the infiltration on railway embankment steep slopes. The model is applied to adjacent 10-m-wide erosion control experimental plots with different percentages of grass cover. A relationship between the 2-day antecedent rainfall and initial moisture content was established and used to predict the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks). Average values of Ks for 0, 50 and 100% grass cover were found to be 0.1, 1.19 and 2.56 mm/h, respectively. For the majority of cases, the model simulated runoff with acceptable accuracy, 68% having Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values above 0.50. The average NSE value varied between 0.60 and 0.80, with 0% grass-covered plots yielding the highest values. As expected, the runoff volume decreased with increasing percentage of grass cover.

Dans la majorite des cas, le modele a simule le ruissellement avec une precision acceptable, 68% des cas obtenant des valeurs d'efficacite de Nash-Sutcliffe (ENS) superieures a 0,50. La valeur moyenne de l'ENS varie entre 0,60 et 0,80, les parcelles sans enherbement donnant les valeurs les plus elevees. Comme on pouvait s'y attendre, le volume de ruissellement diminue avec l'augmentation du pourcentage d'enherbement. Citation Sajjan, A.K., Gyasi-Agyei, Y., and Sharma, R.H., 2013.

AB Hydrological monitoring was conducted in high-relief watersheds in the Japan Alps to investigate the relationship between hillslope hydrological processes and landform evolution in steep granite and shale mountains. In the Koshibu watershed, underlain by Mesozoic shale, the drainage density and frequency was significantly lower than in the Yotagiri watershed underlain by granite. Drainage micro-morphology analysis showed that hillslopes in the watersheds K1 and K6 (Koshibu basin) are mostly combinations of talus and bedrock exposures. In contrast, watershed Y1 (Yotagiri basin) is composed of several zero-order streams with hollows. Infinite slope stability analysis indicates that the regolith shear strength in the K6 watershed (Koshibu basin) is lower than that of the Y1 hillslope, but groundwater levels were higher in the Y1 hillslope than in the K6 hillslope during storm events. These data suggest that, although the shear strength of the soil is stronger in the Yotagiri watershed, the slopes are unstable because of the groundwater conditions, whereas deep-seated landslides may occur episodically in the Koshibu watershed associated with extreme storms and very high antecedent soil moisture. These differences would strongly contribute to the different observed hillslope processes and drainage characteristics. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

TI Hysteresis-based flood-wave analysis using the concept of strain
SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
DE flood-wave analysis; hysteresis; flow strain
AB Hysteresis represents a loop in a rating curve and is a phenomenon which closely resembles that occurring in stress-strain curves used for studying the elastic properties of solid substances in engineering mechanics. Earlier hysteresis-based studies used for defining floodwave propagation in open channels have qualitatively shown that hysteresis is an index of energy loss during floodwave propagation. Using the concept of elasticity, this paper introduces a new term called flow strain (defined as the ratio of change in discharge to the initial discharge) for investigating hysteresis. The usefulness of this new term is evaluated with use of four dam-break studies. The study reveals that:
   1. flow strain is a function of three wave speeds, Seddon speed, Lagrange speed, and elastic speed;
   2. a single linear reservoir concept frequently used in flood routing is a specific variant of the Seddon speed formula;
   3. the non-linear storage-discharge relationship, widely used in overland flow modelling, is a variant of the kinematic wave representation;
   4. the discharge ordinates on the recession part of a hydrograph follow a simple first-order autoregressive form:
   5. the hysteresis, phase difference and logarithmic decrement all define attenuation and are indices of energy loss during floodwave propagation. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper gives a systematic framework for evaluating the time domain reflectometry (TDR) response of soil. TDR measures the soil composite dielectric constant (K-a); thus any factor that has an influence on K-a measurement can affect soil moisture determination. On the basis of known dielectric constants of air, soil, water, and ice, as well as the volumetric fraction of each phase in a bulk soil, functional relationships between volumetric water content (theta(v), cm(3)/cm(-3)) and K-a are derived in the form of theta(v) = nK(a)(0.5) + b. In general, the TDR functions derived from this study are in good agreement with the "universal equation" developed through experiments by Topp et al. [1980] and other available TDR calibration data. This paper demonstrates that (1) soil solid and porosity have little effect on dielectric constant measurement; (2) temperature has a minor influence except for very wet soils; and (3) surface area is an important factor affecting the water content measurement.

ID BASIN
AB [1] A random utility maximization (RUM) model is presented for the purpose of providing benefits estimates to aid in the implementation of the total maximum daily load (TMDL) process. The specific application is to North Carolina, for which the 1994 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Demand for Water-Based Recreation Survey is used to characterize the demand for water recreation in the state as a function of ambient water quality. The RUM choice set is defined to include all 8-digit hydrological units or watersheds in the state, allowing benefits estimates to match the spatial aggregate of interest for the TMDL process. Water quality measures are linked to the choice set via the use of EPA's Index of Watershed Index database. A significant relationship between watershed-level water quality and recreation trip taking behavior is found. Per trip and aggregate benefits estimates are presented for watershed, river basin, and statewide improvements in water quality.

AB Advective transport in a heterogeneous two-dimensional aquifer is simulated and quantified by the statistical moments of tracer travel time and transverse displacement. These moments depend on the statistics of the Lagrangian velocity given as a function of space rather than time. A comparison is made with first-order results that appear to be robust for log transmissivity variance at least up to 1. Lagrangian statistics for travel time clearly expose a few essential features of nonlinear transport: nonstationary distribution and the increasing integral scale of the Lagrangian velocity. These reflect the tendency of streamlines to concentrate into relatively few flow paths (''preferential flow'') for increasing log transmissivity variance. Two simple empirical relationships are identified that in combination with first-order results for the-flow capture the main features of nonlinear transport. The proposed methodology can readily be generalized for analyzing advective transport under more complex flow conditions and for establishing relatively simple analytical models for estimating solute mass flux in heterogeneous aquifers.

ID SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; PROBABILITY; PARTICLE; FORMULA
AB Bedload transport generally depends on the bed shear stress and Reynolds number. Many studies conducted for the condition of turbulent flows have revealed the dependence of the transport rate on the bed shear stress, while knowledge of the Reynolds number effect on the transport rate is very limited. As an extreme case to reflect the viscous effect on sediment transport, sediment transport in laminar flows is considered in this paper. A stochastic approach is adopted to explore how the transport rate can be associated with characteristics of laminar flows. First, the probability of erosion in the absence of turbulence is assumed to depend only on the randomness of bed particles. The probability is then applied to formulate the sediment transport rate, of which the derivation is made largely based on Einstein's bedload theory. The theoretical result indicates that the dimensionless transport rate for laminar flows is dependent on the dimensionless shear stress and dimensionless particle diameter or the shear Reynolds number. Comparisons are finally made between the derived formula and an empirical correlation available in the literature. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A theoretical framework is presented that allows direct identification of a single point-source pollution location and time in heterogeneous multidimensional systems under known flow field conditions. Based on the concept of the transfer function theory, it is shown that an observed pollution plume contains all the necessary information to predict the concentration at the unknown pollution source when a reversed flow field transport simulation is performed. This target concentration C-0 is obtained from a quadratic integral of the observed pollution plume itself. Backwards simulation of the pollution plume leads to shrinkage of the C-0-contour due to dispersion. When the C-0-contour reduces to a singular point, i.e. becomes a concentration maximum, the position of the pollution source is identified and the backward simulation time indicates the time elapsed since the contaminant release. The theoretical basis of the method is first developed for the ideal case that the pollution plume is entirely known and is illustrated using a synthetic heterogeneous 2D example where all the hydro-dispersive parameters are known. The same example is then used to illustrate the procedure for a more realistic case, i.e. where only few observation points exist.

AB Data truncation is a practical necessity of laboratory column experiments because of both time and detection-limit constraints. In this paper, we study the extent to which data truncation can affect estimates of transport modeling parameters, as derived from temporal moment calculations and in the context of solute transport experiments that are influenced by sorption and nonequilibrium partitioning among mobile and immobile phases. Our results show that, for a given amount of solute used, step changes in input conditions can give more accurate moment-derived parameters than Dirac or square-wave pulses, whereas Dirac and square-wave pulses are essentially identical in terms of accuracy of parameter estimates. By simulating data truncation for a wide range of column input and transport conditions, we provide guidance toward the experimental designs that are needed to keep parameter estimation error within specified bounds, assuming nonequilibrium conditions of transport that result from either first-order or diffusion-based rate processes. More specifically, we investigate the relationships between mass of solute added to the system, minimum solute quantification limits, experiment duration times, and accuracy of parameter estimation, all as a function of experimental conditions.

AB Environmental flows remain biased toward the traditional biological group of fish species. Consequently, these flows ignore the inter-annual flow variability that rules species with longer lifecycles and therefore disregard the long-term perspective of the riverine ecosystem. We analyzed the importance of considering riparian requirements for the long-term efficiency of environmental flows. For that analysis, we modeled the riparian vegetation development for a decade facing different environmental flows in two case studies. Next, we assessed the corresponding fish habitat availability of three common fish species in each of the resulting riparian landscape scenarios. Modeling results demonstrated that the environmental flows disregarding riparian vegetation requirements promoted riparian degradation, particularly vegetation encroachment. Such circumstance altered the hydraulic characteristics of the river channel where flow depths and velocities underwent local changes of up to 10 cm and 40 cm s(-1), respectively. Accordingly, after a decade of this flow regime, the available habitat area for the considered fish species experienced modifications of up to 110 % when compared to the natural habitat. In turn, environmental flows regarding riparian vegetation requirements were able to maintain riparian vegetation near natural standards, thereby preserving the hydraulic characteristics of the river channel and sustaining the fish habitat close to the natural condition. As a result, fish habitat availability never changed more than 17 % from the natural habitat.

AB Two-phase characteristic curves are necessary for the simulation of water and vapor flow in porous media. Existing functions such as van Genuchten [1980], Brooks and Corey, [1966], and Luckner et al. [1989] have significant limitations in the dry region as the liquid saturation goes to zero. This region, which is important in a number of applications; including liquid and vapor flow and vapor-solid sorption, has been the subject of a number of previous investigations. Most previous studies extended standard capillary pressure curves into the adsorption region to zero water content and required a refitting of the revised curves to the data. In contrast, the present method provides for a simple extension of existing capillary pressure curves without the need to refit the experimental data. Therefore previous curve fits can be used, and the transition between the existing fit and the relationship in the adsorption region is easily calculated. The data-model comparison shows good agreement. This extension is a simple and convenient way to extend existing curves to the dry region.

AB Assessment of landslide-triggering rainfall thresholds is useful for early warning in prone areas.
   In this paper, it is shown how stochastic rainfall models and hydrological and slope stability physically based models can be advantageously combined in a Monte Carlo simulation framework to generate virtually unlimited-length synthetic rainfall and related slope stability factor of safety data, exploiting the information contained in observed rainfall records and field-measurements of soil hydraulic and geotechnical parameters. The synthetic data set, di-chotomized in triggering and non-triggering rainfall events, is analyzed by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to derive stochastic-input physically based thresholds that optimize the trade-off between correct and wrong predictions. Moreover, the specific modeling framework implemented in this work, based on hourly analysis, enables one to analyze the uncertainty related to variability of rainfall intensity within events and to past rainfall (antecedent rainfall). A specific focus is dedicated to the widely used power-law rainfall intensity-duration (I-D) thresholds.
   Results indicate that variability of intensity during rainfall events influences significantly rainfall intensity and duration associated with landslide triggering. Remarkably, when a time-variable rainfall-rate event is considered, the simulated triggering points may be separated with a very good approximation from the non-triggering ones by a I-D powerlaw equation, while a representation of rainfall as constant-intensity hyetographs globally leads to non-conservative results. This indicates that the I-D power-law equation is adequate to represent the triggering part due to transient infiltration produced by rainfall events of variable intensity and thus gives a physically based justification for this widely used threshold form, which provides results that are valid when landslide occurrence is mostly due to that part. These conditions are more likely to occur in hillslopes of low specific upslope contributing area, relatively high hydraulic conductivity and high critical wetness ratio. Otherwise, rainfall time history occurring before single rainfall events influences landslide triggering, determining whether a threshold based only on rainfall intensity and duration may be sufficient or it needs to be improved by the introduction of antecedent rainfall variables. Further analyses show that predictability of landslides decreases with soil depth, critical wetness ratio and the increase of vertical basal drainage (leakage) that occurs in the presence of a fractured bedrock.

   COMPARISON OF METHODS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID DISPERSION
AB The primary objectives of the Twin Lake experiments have been to study geologic heterogencities and field-scale dispersion and to provide data for developing and evaluating groundwater flow and transport models. The experiment reported here was undertaken in 1987-1988 to expand the studies of heterogeneity and dispersion from a 40-m scale investigated in 1983 to a full 270-m scale from the point of tracer injection to the groundwater discharge zone. The hydrogeologic setting, the experimental and analytical methods, and the interpretation of experimental data are the topics of discussion in this paper. The 1983 and 1987-1988 tracer tests were used to evaluate the predictive abilities of various numerical groundwater flow and transport models. The modeling is done along the mean flow direction in the vertical plane. The two-dimensional finite-element modeling was successful in simulating the hydraulic head distribution but not the groundwater motion or the tracer transport. In addition, owing to the advection-dominated nature of the groundwater flow, the transport simulation suffered from numerical dispersion. Significant improvements in simulations were obtained using method-of-characteristics- and random-walk-based computer models. The influence of dimensionality on the transport simulation was evaluated by comparing the two- and three-dimensional random-walk simulations. It was found that over the first 40 m along the mean flow path, the three-dimensional simulation does not reproduce the plume migration any better than the two-dimensional simulation does. Random-walk simulations of the transport observed in the 1983 and 1987-1988 tests are also done on the basis of the advection-dispersion equation and tracer test-derived velocities without invoking the concept of hydraulic conductivity and Darcy's law. These simulations were found to be superior to simulations based on the coupled flow and transport models. It was also found that the simulated hydraulic head distribution is insensitive to spatial variations in hydraulic conductivity and the simulated groundwater velocity distribution is inappropriate for transport modeling. It was concluded that the advection-dispersion models of the local-scale transport perform better in predicting the tracer migration at the Twin Lake aquifer using measured velocities rather than velocities simulated by a flow model.

AB High-magnitude floods across Europe within the last decade have resulted in the widespread reassessment of flood risk; this coupled with the introduction of the Water Framework Directive (2000) has increased the need for a detailed understanding of seasonal variability in flood magnitude and frequency.
   Mean day of flood (MDF) and flood seasonality were calculated for Wales using 30 years of gauged river-flow records (1973-2002). Noticeable regional variations in timing and length of flood season are evident, with flooding occurring earlier in small catchments draining higher elevations in north and mid-west Wales. Low-altitude regions in West Wales exposed to westerly winds experience flooding during October-January, while large eastern draining catchments experience later flooding (January-February). In the northeast and mid-east regions December-January months experience the greatest number of floods, while the southeast has a slightly longer flood season (December-February), with a noticeable increase in January floods. Patterns obtained from MDF data demonstrate their effectiveness and use in analysing regional patterns in flood seasonality, but catchment-specific determinants, e. g. catchment wetness, size and precipitation regime are important factors in flood seasonality. Relatively strong correlations between precipitation and flood activity are evident in Wales, with a poorer relationship between flooding and weather types and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

ID STOCHASTIC-MODEL; RAINFALL; TIME
AB Under the conditions of system linearity and stationarity of the precipitation process we derive the hyetograph associated with any given flood discharge Q, using best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) theory. The BLUE hyetograph depends explicitly on the correlation characteristics of the rainfall process and the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) of the basin. When the correlation time of the rainfall process is short relative to the dispersion of the IUH, the shape of the BLUE hyetograph is the mirror image of the IUH itself. In the opposite case the design hyetograph is the mirror image of the rainfall correlation function. The procedure is extended from lumped to semidistributed and distributed basins. In the latter case we obtain simultaneous design hyetographs for each subbasin or each site in the basin. The analytical findings and the possibility of regionalization are verified using synthetic and recorded rainfall time series, with excellent agreement in both cases. Because of its simplicity, robustness, and theoretical basis the proposed procedure should be appealing for practical use, particularly when not only the peak but the entire flood hydrograph is required.

TI Calculation of average landslide frequency using climatic records
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Aerial photographs are used to develop a relationship between the number of debris slides generated during a hydrologic event and the size of the event, and the longterm average debris-slide frequency is calculated from climate records using the relation. For a site in California with an average of 8.3 slides km(-2) yr(-1), a sequence of four photo sets (representing 10-15 years, 35-50 observed slides, and 4-6 large storms) is needed to estimate the long-term debris-slide frequency to within 30% of the actual value (p = 0.90). If climatic records are used, a record length of 5-10 years (17-35 observed slides and 2-4 significant storms) is sufficient to provide the same accuracy. The climate-based model suggests that debris-slide frequency changed from approximately 1.6 to 8.3 slides km(-2) yr(-1) during the late 1930s owing to an increased frequency of high-intensity storms. The model accurately predicts the change in slide-scar density observed on sequential aerial photographs following the climatic shift.

AB Boron, Cl-, and Br- concentrations and boron isotopic compositions (delta B-11) were used to provide insight into the sources and water-sediment interactions of fossil water in a thick nonfractured aquitard system in Saskatchewan, Canada. The aquitard system consists of SO m of late Pleistocene clay-rich till disconformably overlying 77 m of late Cretaceous marine clay. The clay is underlain by a regional sand aquifer. Variations in Cl- and Br- confirmed the presence of well-defined conservative mixing relationships between four types of fluids present in the aquitard system: (1) low-Cl- water from the base of the fractured and oxidized till zone at 4 m depth; (2) water characterized by an elevated Cl- peak (190 mg/L) at about 12 m; (3) glacial meltwater present between 20 and 60 m depth; and (4) more saline water (Cl- up to 1000 mg/L) from the underlying Cretaceous clay and sand aquifer, Glacial meltwater has low Cl-, delta B-11 (similar to 20%), and Cl-/Br- ratios (50). The low Cl-/Br- ratio of the glacial meltwater is similar to that of modern inland precipitation, which suggests that the Br- budget in the atmosphere 20-30 ka B.P. was similar to that of today and that Br- enrichment in the atmosphere may be a natural process. The relatively low Cl-/Br- ratio (similar to 150) and delta B-11 values of the saline water in the sand aquifer (35 and 39 parts per thousand, respectively) and pore water in the Cretaceous clay (25.6 and 32.6 parts per thousand, respectively) are not consistent with simple dilution of seawater but suggest dilution and modification of fifteenfold evaporated seawater with a low Cl-/Br- and a high delta B-11 value (> 39 parts per thousand). This evaporitic seawater may have been entrapped in the Cretaceous clay upon or after its deposition and subsequently flushed from the clay by fresher water. We suggest that the refreshening process modified the original brine into Na-HCO3 water type and extracted boron with delta B-11 < 39 parts per thousand from the adsorbed sites. In contrast, increase of Cl- in the upper section of the till (the 12 m peak) resulted in apparent depletion of dissolved boron and relative B-11 enrichment, which can be explained by adsorption processes. The B-delta B-11 relationships can thus be used to trace water-clay interactions in aquitard systems.

AB The computation of the erosion index (El), which is basic to the determination of the rainfall-runoff erosivity factor R of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). is tedious and time-consuming and requires a continuous record of rainfall intensity. In this study. a power equation (r(2) = 0.867) involving annual erosion index in the Mediterranean part of Italy is obtained. Data from 12 raingauge stations are used to derive and then test a regional relationship for estimating the erosion index from only three rainfall parameters. Erosivity rainfall data derived from 5 additional stations are used for validation and critical examination. The empirical procedures give results which compare satisfactorily with relationships calibrated elsewhere.

AB [1] We use a synoptic sampling of stream water to quantify the effect of soil type, rock type, deforestation extent determined by Landsat TM imagery, and urban population density on stream solute concentrations for 60 different watersheds in the dry season and 49 in the wet season in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon basin. Catchment areas range between 18 and 12,500 km(2). Soil exchangeable cation content explains most of the variance in stream concentrations of cations, dissolved silicon ( Si), and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) in both forested and deforested basins based on regression analysis (R-2 range 0.61-0.81), though the mechanism underlying the relationship is unknown. We use the relationship between soil exchangeable cation content and stream solute concentrations in forested catchments to estimate the predisturbance and postdisturbance signal concentrations of stream solutes for deforested watersheds. Signal concentrations of potassium ( K), sodium (Na), and chloride (Cl) increase with deforestation extent for streams on gneiss, granite, and sedimentary rock in both the dry and wet seasons after the effect of soil type has been statistically removed. Sulfate (SO4) signal concentrations increase with deforestation extent in the dry season only. For catchments > 40% deforested but with no urban populations, the ratios of disturbed to predisturbance stream concentrations range from 1.2 to 3.1 (K), 0.8 to 2.2 (Na), 0.7 to 2.7 (SO4), and 2.4 to 14.6 (Cl) in the dry season and 1.2 to 2.2 (K) and 0.6 to 3.4 (Cl) in the wet season. Urban population density strongly affects Cl and SO4 concentrations in both seasons and Na concentrations in the dry season; the urban signal comprises 40-58% of the dry season Cl signal and 83-89% of the wet season Cl signal for watersheds with > 250 persons per km(2). Streams on mica-schist, mafic rock and carbonate shale have higher concentrations of Ca, Mg, Si, andANC than watersheds on gneiss, granite, tertiary sediments or sandstone for a given soil exchangeable cation content in both seasons. Simple mass balance calculations suggest that supplemental cattle salts could comprise a significant fraction of the Na and Cl signals in the wet season but would not significantly impact wet season concentrations of Ca, Mg, or K.

TI Flood frequency analysis at ungauged sites using artificial neural

ID BRITISH-COLUMBIA; ENSEMBLES; REGION; REGRESSION; CANADA
AB [1] Models based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are developed to obtain improved flood quantile estimates at ungauged sites. CCA is used to form a canonical physiographic space using the site characteristics from gauged sites. Then ANN models are applied to identify the functional relationships between flood quantiles and the physiographic variables in the CCA space. Two ANN models, the single ANN model and the ensemble ANN model, are developed. The proposed approaches are applied to 151 catchments in the province of Quebec, Canada. Two evaluation procedures, the jackknife validation procedure and the split sample validation procedure, are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. Results of the proposed models are compared with the original CCA model, the canonical kriging model, and the original ANN models. The results indicate that the CCA-based ANN models provide superior estimation than the original ANN models. The ANN ensemble approaches provide better generalization ability than the single ANN models. The CCA-based ensemble ANN model has the best performance among all models in terms of prediction accuracy.

SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

ID FLOW
AB For steady two-dimensional free surface flow over a horizontal impervious base, the Dupuit-Forchheimer theory assumes that the vertical component of velocity is zero, even for non-zero accretion rate at the free surface.-This is improved by assuming that the vertical velocity component is zero at the base, and is proportional to height above the base. This requires the piezometric head to depend linearly on the square of the height, and the two parameters in this relation can be fitted to the two boundary conditions at the free surface, to give an expression for the free surface slope in terms of accretion, free surface height, and the pressure integral. For problems in which the pressure integral is known explicitly, this first order of ordinary differential equation for the free surface height can be solved numerically. The solutions are more accurate than the Dupuit-Forchheimer expressions for the free surface, and much easier to calculate than numerical solutions to the full two-dimensional problem. Four examples are given, leading to some simple analytical approximations for quantities of interest. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a three-dimensional (3-D) model of fractures that within the same framework, allows a systematic study of the interplay and relative importance of the two key factors determining the character of flow in the system. The two factors of complexity are (1) the geometry of fracture plane structure and interconnections and (2) the aperture variability within these planes. Previous models have concentrated on each separately. We introduce anisotropic percolation to model a wide range of fracture structures and networks. The conclusion is that either of these elements, fracture geometry and aperture variability, can give rise to channeled flow and that the interplay between them is especially important for this type of flow. Significant outcomes of our study are (1) a functional relationship that quantifies the dependence of the effective hydraulic conductivity on aperture variability and on the network structure and fracture element density, (2) a relation between aperture variability and the Peclet number, and (3) a basis for a new explanation for the field-length dependence of permeability observed in fractured and heterogeneous porous formations.

AB We present paired measurements of the water content and electrical conductivity collected in a laboratory column packed with a homogeneous, clean sand over a wide range of water content and pore water electrical conductivity (EC) conditions. The EC was determined using the method of Nadler et al. [1991] from waveforms collected with two-rod time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes with and without baluns and with three-rod probes without baluns. Following Heimovaara et al. [1995], we calibrated the probes in saline solutions to account for the series resistance of the cable and connectors. The calibrated EC shows a nonlinear dependence on the water content that is well described by a simple power relationship [Archie, 1942]. Recognizing that calibration in saline solutions is impractical for some TDR probes, we demonstrate that the EC response can be calibrated directly using the results of drainage events, incorporating only a separate calibration of the cable resistance. None of the probe designs shows any clear advantage for EC measurement.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to study solute transport along preferential flow paths in unsaturated, inclined fractures. Qualitative aspects of solute transport were identified in a miscible dye tracer experiment conducted in a transparent replica of a natural granite fracture. Additional experiments were conducted to measure the breakthrough curves of a conservative tracer introduced into an established preferential flow path in two different fracture replicas and a rock-replica combination. The influence of gravity was investigated by varying fracture inclination. The relationship between the travel times of the solute and the relative influence of gravity was substantially affected by two modes of intermittent flow that occurred: the snapping rivulet and the pulsating blob modes. The measured travel times of the solute were evaluated with three transfer function models: the axial dispersion, the reactors-in-series, and the lognormal models. The three models described the solute travel times nearly equally well. A mechanistic model was also formulated to describe transport when the pulsating blob mode occurred which assumed blobs of water containing solute mixed with residual pools of water along the flow path.

AB Evapotranspiration is a major component of the global water cycle and provides a critical nexus between terrestrial water, carbon and surface energy exchanges. Evapotranspiration is inherently difficult to measure and predict especially at large spatial scales. Remote sensing provides a cost-effective method to estimate evapotranspiration at regional to global scales. In the past three decades a large number of studies on remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimation have emerged. This review summarizes the basic theories underpinning current remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimation methods. It also lays out the development history of these methods and compares their advantages and limitations. Several key directions for further study are identified and discussed, including identification of uncertainty sources in remote sensing evapotranspiration models, merging of different remote sensing methods, application of data assimilation and fusion techniques in producing robust evapotranspiration estimates, and utilization of multi-source remote sensing data and latest sensor technologies. Further advances in the remote sensing of evapotranspiration will enhance capabilities for monitoring of the global water and energy cycles, including water availability and ecosystem responses and feedbacks to climate change and human impacts.

AB Inversion of Dagan's two- and three-dimensional stochastic models using Freyberg's (1986), Rajaram and Gelhar's (1988, 1991), and Barry and Sposito's (1990) moment data from the Borden experiment is carried out to examine (1) the validity of the two-dimensional (Dagan, 1982) and three-dimensional (Dagan, 1988) models and (2) the reduction in uncertainty of the spatial moments over nonconditioned estimates. A direct application of Bayesian statistical inference, in conjunction with Monte Carlo integration, is used to produce posterior probability density functions for the parameters. The parameter ranges from all methods show horizontal integral scales lambda between 1.85 and 4.04 m, vertical integral scales lambda(z) between 0. 144 and 0.459 m, and log hydraulic conductivities In (K) between 0.120 and 0.197. These results compare well to the earlier estimates of Woodbury and Sudicky (1991) and Robin et al. (1991). We show that moment prediction uncertainty is substantially reduced when both tracer moment data and prior estimates of the In (K) geostatistical parameters are incorporated into theoretical formulae based on stochastic dispersion theory.
