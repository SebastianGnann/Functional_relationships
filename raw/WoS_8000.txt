AB Given increasing demand for high frequency streamflow series (HFSS) at daily and subdaily time scales there is increasing need for reliable metrics of relative variability for such series. HFSS can exhibit enormous relative variability especially in comparison with low frequency streamflow series formed by aggregation of HFSS. The product moment estimator of the coefficient of variation C, defined as the ratio of sample standard deviation to sample mean, as well as ten other common estimators of C, are shown to provide severely downward biased and highly variable estimates of C for very long records of highly skewed and periodic HFSS particularly for rivers which exhibit zeros. Resorting to the theory of compound distributions, we introduce an estimator of C corresponding to a mixture of monthly zero-inflated lognormal distributions denoted as a delta lognormal monthly mixture Delta LN3MM model. Through monthly stratification, our Delta LN3MM model accounts for the seasonality, skewness, multimodality, and the possible intermittency of HFSS. In comparisons among estimators, our Delta LN3MM based C estimator is shown to yield much more reliable and approximately unbiased estimates of C not only for small samples but also for very large samples (tens of thousands of observations). We document values of C in the range of [0.18, 42,000] with a median of 1.9 and an interquartile range of [1.34, 3.75] for 6807 daily streamflow series across the U.S. from GAGES-II dataset, with the highest values of C occurring in arid and semiarid regions. A multivariate analysis and national contour map reveal that extremely large values of C, never previously documented, tend to occur in arid watersheds with low runoff ratios, which tend to also exhibit a considerable number of zero streamflows.

AB Droughts have been occurring with increased frequency and bringing with them considerable losses. Due to its nature, the best approach to monitoring and assessing droughts is in terms of stochastic theories. As a consequence, this study applied SPI in the hydrological drought detection, and examine/interpret drought-related phenomena. The 3-month SPI is used to decide the drought development and terminate phases based on the coincidence of hydrological drought and anomalies in precipitation.
   Four primary characteristics were determined to clarify the descriptions of drought magnitude and occurrence: duration, deficit, occurrence time and recurrence year. A stochastic process of drought is established to take account these characteristics using the copula function and a Poisson process as well as non-stationarity. Case study on the Shihmen and Zengwen reservoir watersheds in Taiwan revealed that hydrological drought events often coincide with meteorological drought, but some inconsistencies due to unusual hydrological hysteresis in rainfall and runoff. Our analysis raised several issues, including the choice of drought identification parameters and SPI time scale/threshold, which should take into account anthropogenic activity and hydrological characteristics. A positive correlation between drought duration and drought deficit and a negative correlation between them and occurrence time were identified. It was also observed that subsequent drought event may be more severe due to the partial recovery of hydrological condition. In terms of non-stationarity, our results do not show strong evidence of long-term trend for drought characteristics. Some limitations could be due to the percentile-to-percentile basis of copula. This issue may need to be examined using non-stationary copula analysis or time-variant correlation-covariance models. In the end, we demonstrated that this framework can apply in forecasting drought conditions and generating synthetic droughts for use in the formulation of water resources management strategies and the development of drought preparedness plans.

TI A simple inertial formulation of the shallow water equations for
   efficient two-dimensional flood inundation modelling
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID PREDICTIONS; UNCERTAINTY
AB This paper describes the development of a new set of equations derived from 1D shallow water theory for use in 2D storage cell inundation models where flows in the x and y Cartesian directions are decoupled. The new equation set is designed to be solved explicitly at very low computational cost, and is here tested against a suite of four test cases of increasing complexity. In each case the predicted water depths compare favourably to analytical solutions or to simulation results from the diffusive storage cell code of Hunter et al. (2005). For the most complex test involving the fine spatial resolution simulation of flow in a topographically complex urban area the Root Mean Squared Difference between the new formulation and the model of Hunter et al. is similar to 1 cm. However, unlike diffusive storage cell codes where the stable time step scales with (1/Delta x)(2), the new equation set developed here represents shallow water wave propagation and so the stability is controlled by the Courant-Freidrichs-Lewy condition such that the stable time step instead scales with 1/Delta x. This allows use of a stable time step that is 1-3 orders of magnitude greater for typical cell sizes than that possible with diffusive storage cell models and results in commensurate reductions in model run times. For the tests reported in this paper the maximum speed up achieved over a diffusive storage cell model was 1120x, although the actual value seen will depend on model resolution and water surface gradient. Solutions using the new equation set are shown to be grid-independent for the conditions considered and to have an intuitively correct sensitivity to friction, however small instabilities and increased errors on predicted depth were noted when Manning's n = 0.01. The new equations are likely to find widespread application in many types of flood inundation modelling and should provide a useful additional tool, alongside more established model formulations, for a variety of flood risk management studies.

AB Inversion of vertical electrical sounding (VES) data, especially from the crystalline hard rock area, assumes a special significance for groundwater exploration. Here we used a newly developed algorithm based on the Bayesian neural network (BNN) theory combined with Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC)/Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation scheme to invert the Direct Current (DC) YES measurements obtained from 30-locations around Tenduli-Vengurla, Sindhudurg district, Maharashtra, India. The inversion results suggest that the top layer is mostly comprised of laterites followed by mixture of clay/clayey sand and garnulites/granite as basement rocks. The source of groundwater appears to be accessible in weathered/semi-weathered layer of laterite/clayey sand that exists within the depth of 10-15 m from the surface. The NW-SE trending major lineaments and its criss-crosses are also identified from the apparent and true resistivity surface map. The pseudo-section at different depths in the western part of the area, near Nivti, shows extensive influence of saltwater intrusion and its impact reaching up to the depth of 30 m from the surface along the coastal area. Our results also show that intrusion of saline water decreases from the western part to the eastern part of the region. Two dimensional modeling of four resistivity profiles from the study region identified two potential groundwater reservoirs; one lying between Path-Tenduli and another in between Mat and Zaraph. The deduced true electrical resistivity section against depth correlates well with available borehole lithology in the area. The results presented here would be useful for interpreting the geological signatures like fractures, major joints and lineaments, which in turn will be helpful for identifying groundwater reservoirs and drainage pattern in the crystalline hard rock area. The newly developed HMC-based BNN method is robust and would provide insights for constraining the geophysical models and criteria for modeling resistivity data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Observation wells around a pumping well are the primary means of monitoring the change of hydraulic head in an aquifer. Pipe flow in open observation boreholes will affect the measurement of hydraulic head in the observation wells and alter the flow patterns around the wells, but the influences of non-Darcian pipe flow in observation wells on the accuracy of hydraulic head measurements are not fully recognized. This paper presents a coupled seepage-pipe flow theory which integrates the aquifer and well as a continuous medium for assessing the influences. The objective of this study is to examine the pipe-flow effects in observation wells of varied diameters under several pumping scenarios including different penetration lengths of the pumping well. A numerical model based on the Galerkin finite element method and the finite difference method was developed for the study. Numerical simulations were conducted for a homogeneous and isotropic confined aquifer in which a pumping well penetrated a different thickness of the aquifer and a number of full penetrating observation wells were placed to obtain drawdowns. The simulation results indicated that vertical pipe flow within the observation wells was significant and the flow was non-linear. The pipe flow resulted in a conduit effect that disturbed the distribution of the hydraulic head within the observation wells. After comparing with the results of the Hantush (1961) integral by using the case study, which neglected the wellbore effect on the groundwater flow system, the authors found that the Hantush integral may be only conditionally applicable for estimating the drawdown within the observation wells when well diameter is greater than 0.20 m and radial distance is greater than the thickness of the aquifer. Our study suggests that use of hydraulic heads from observation wells for the evaluation of groundwater flow systems must be cautious before the pipe-flow effect can be assumed to be negligible.

AB An experimental technique based on image analysis was used to perform a Lagrangian description of passive pollutant particle motion in a three-dimensional saturated porous medium. To allow for optical access, the experiment was carried out with Pyrex grains as the solid matrix and glycerol as the liquid phase in order to have two phases with the same refractive index. Statistical analysis of the experimental data allowed for estimation of velocity and displacement probability density functions (pdf), velocity component correlation functions, Lagrangian integral scales, and mechanical dispersion coefficient tensor components. The results obtained suggest that the longitudinal velocity component has a log normal pdf while the transversal component has a symmetrical pdf, which is nevertheless not Gaussian for high values of the kurtosis. Furthermore, the velocity components' autocorrelation functions are well represented by exponential laws, and the integral scale is dependent on filtration velocity and grain size. As foreseen in the theory the total displacement pdf shows the tendency to reach normal distribution after many integral scales. The evaluated dispersion coefficient tensor components are dependent on travel time; the components start from zero and reach an asymptotic value after several integral scales. Furthermore, the tensor is anisotropic, with the longitudinal component greater than the transversal one by about 1 order of magnitude. Comparison with other experimental data shows agreement at least for the longitudinal dispersion component. Dagan's linear theory has been used for comparing the analytical longitudinal component of the dispersion tensor with that obtained by means of the experiments.

AB Based on the kinematic wave theory, which is shown to be generally applicable to road drainage situations, a method has been developed for the determination of road drainage inlet spacing under the continuous grade condition. The input data required are the allowable maximum flood width, the physical characteristics of the roadway, the empirical relationship between the maximum discharge and the intercepted flow, and the rainfall intensity-duration curve. Application of the method to the Singapore inlet condition shows that for a given maximum flood width, the inlet spacing varies with the cross and longitudinal slopes of the roadway. The spacing of inlets is wider for roads with steeper slopes.

AB This paper introduces Tsallis statistics and the q-exponential distribution as a means of analysing hydrological phenomena. The basic framework is introduced and then the method is used to derive a distribution for flood recurrence intervals using recently published data from the River Po, Italy. This fits the data much more effectively than the simple power-law applied in a previous study. Hence, a distribution derived from power-law considerations is more appropriate than the power-law itself. Nonextensive statistical mechanics has the potential for much broader utility in hydrology than is demonstrated here. Some potential avenues for future study are introduced. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The relationship between flow quantity and scenic quality was measured for a "wild and scenic" river in Colorado.  Respondents' scenic beauty judgments of video sequences depicting the river at flow rates from 120 to 2650 cfs (3.40 to 75.0 m3/s) were scaled to an interval scale measure of perceived scenic beauty following psychophysical scaling procedures.  Regressions of scenic beauty on variables describing flow and other site characteristics showed scenic beauty to increase as flow increased up to about 1100-1500 cfs (31-42 m3/s) and then fall as flow continued to increase.  Optimum flows for scenic beauty typically occur for two short periods each year, during the ascending and descending portions of the annual late spring peak runoff season.  Flow explained from 10 to 25% of the variance in scenic beauty, depending on how much emphasis the scenic beauty judgment format tended to place on flow.

AB Macropore flow is a ubiquitous hydrologic process that has not been well explained using traditional hydrologic theories. In particular, macropore flow velocity (MFV) is poorly understood with respect to its typical ranges and controlling factors. Here we conducted a meta-analysis based on an MFV dataset compiled from 243 measurements documented in 76 journal articles. The dataset includes MFV values measured using different approaches across the soil-core, field-profile, and trench scales. Our analyses show that MFV has a geometric mean of 1.08 x 10(-3) m s(-1), which is about 2 similar to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding values of saturated hydraulic conductivity in the soil matrix. Using machine learning methods including classification and regression tree and random forests algorithms, we identified observation scale, travel distance, rainfall intensity and macropore diameter as the most important factors that control MFV. MFV is much larger at the trench scale than at the other two scales mainly due to abundant large macropores. Correlation analysis and multivariate regression revealed that (1) MFV and rainfall intensity have significant positive correlation, which indicates that MFV is a dynamic variable; and (2) MFV and macropore diameter also have strong positive correlation at the trench scale, which indicates macropore size as a key controlling factor. Using macropore diameter and rainfall intensity as explanatory factors, MFV can be well predicted (R-2 = 0.76) by a multivariate regression equation at trench-scale, implying that rainfall intensity can be considered a proxy for the filling degree of macropores. Furthermore, both the Poiseuille and Manning equations were found to overestimate the MFV values, suggesting a parameter representing the connectivity of the macropore network is needed for providing reasonable estimates of MFV using physically-based equations.

AB A robust and reliable chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration algorithm is still lacking for optically complex waters due to the lack of understanding of the bio-optical process. Machine learning approaches, which excel at detecting potential complex nonlinear relationships, provide opportunities to estimate Chla accurately for optically complex waters. However, the uncertainties in atmospheric correction (AC) may be amplified in different Chla algorithms. Here, we aim to select one state-of-the-art algorithm or establish a new algorithm based on machine learning approaches that less sensitive to AC uncertainties. Firstly, nine state-of-the-art empirical, semianalytical, and optical water types (OWT) classification-based Chla algorithms were imple-mented. These existing algorithms showed good performance by using in situ database, however, failed in actual OLCI applications due to their sensitivity to AC uncertainties. Thus, four popular machine learning approaches (random forest regression (RFR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), deep neural network (DNN), and support vector regression (SVR)) were then employed. Among them, the "RFR-Chla" model performed the best and showed less sensitivity to AC uncertainties. Finally, the Chla spatiotemporal variations in 163 major lakes across eastern China were mapped from OLCI between May 2016 and April 2020 using the proposed RFR-Chla model. Generally, the lakes in eastern China are severely eutrophic, with an average Chla concentration of 33.39 +/- 6.95 mu g/L. Spatially, Chla in the south of eastern China was significantly higher than those in northern lakes. Seasonally, Chla was high in the summer and autumn and low in the spring and winter. This study provides a reference for water quality monitoring in turbid inland waters suffering certain AC uncertainties and supports aquatic management and SDG 6 reporting.

AB As one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world, southwest China is experiencing a lack of surface water resources which have negative impacts on the development of the economy and the life of people. Determining the relationship between climate, watershed characteristics and the runoff coefficient is thus important to manage water resources. However, the dominant factors influencing runoff coefficient is still unclear in karst areas (e.g., southwest China). The objective of this study was to examine how the runoff coefficient is related to climate and watershed characteristics (i.e., land use composition, landscape, lithology, soil properties, and topography) for 95 selected karst watersheds. Since climatic and watershed variables are highly codependent, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to explain the linkages between the runoff coefficient and 36 selected variables. First-order controls were identified by calculating the variable importance for the projection (VIP). Results showed that the climate and watershed characteristics played an important role in the runoff coefficient and could explain 72% of the total variance in runoff coefficient for the 95 selected watersheds. According to the VIP values, the dominant first-order factors controlling runoff coefficient were as follows: precipitation, elevation, the areal percentage of forestland, largest patch index, Shannon's diversity index, the areal percentage grassland, aggregation index, gravel content, hypsometric integral and karst coverage. Greater precipitation, gravel content, and the areal percentage of forestland significantly enhanced the runoff coefficient, while the elevation, Shannon's diversity index, and karst coverage had negative effects on runoff coefficient. As partially eliminating the co-dependency of the variables, the PLSR approach conveniently determined factors controlling runoff coefficient, and could provide quantitative information to enable decision makers to make better watershed management planning. This effective approach could be recommended to a variety of other karst watersheds.

AB The quantification of point source (PS) pollution and non-point source (NPS) pollution in different regions is needed so that targeted management strategies for water environment managers can be prepared. The aim of this study was to establish a method for quantifying PS and NPS pollution by measuring ion concentrations. The Danjiangkou Reservoir and its main tributaries were selected as the study area. The spatiotemporal variation in the concentration of nutrients and ions was analyzed. The results showed that the main ions did not display any distinct spatiotemporal variations on the reservoir, but spatiotemporal variations were evident in the tributaries: Mg2+, Na+, SO42- and Cl- were lowest in the wet season, K+ was highest in the dry-to-wet transition season, and Si was highest in the wet season. We selected Cl-/TN, SO42-/TN, and Na+/TN as PS pollution tracking indicators and K+/TN, Ca2+/TN, and Si/TN as NPS pollution tracking indicators. The mean contribution rate of NPS pollution calculated using Cl-/TN, Na+/TN, and Si/TN, and by the isotope approach, had a significant linear relationship (p < 0.01). Therefore, Cl-/TN, Na+/TN and Si/TN were used to quantitatively assess the pollution sources. The calculated results indicated the TN load was dominated by the NPS pollution, and the average contribution rates of NPS of TN in the tributaries from the dry season to the wet season were 79%, 83%, and 93%, respectively. The TN load of NPS was highest during the wet season with a maximum value over 400 x 10(-3) t a(-1) km(-2), while the TN load of PS was highest during the dry season with a maximum value of 39.3 t a(-1). This study provides a new approach to the quantitative analysis of pollution sources by using hydrochemical characteristic ion indicators.

AB An experimental loamy sand soil tank (12 m long x 1.5 m wide x 1.5 m deep) with a slope of 3 degrees was designed to conduct artificial rainfall-runoff experiments and continuously monitor soil moisture (SM), rainfall, surface runoff (SR) and subsurface runoff (SSR). A total of 28 rainfall-runoff events are analysed to investigate the capability of estimating rainfall from SM observations through SM2RAIN algorithm which is then adjusted in SM2RAIN-exp according to the conditions of the artificial rainfall-runoff experiment, i.e., including the SR and SSR component. The main purpose of this study is to test the underlying hypotheses of SM2RAIN algorithm in a controlled experiment to better understand the most important processes driving the relationship between SM and rainfall.
   Results suggest that SM2RAIN-exp demonstrates satisfactory performance in estimating rainfall with respect to the observed data. When the aggregation intervals of rainfall increase, the SM2RAIN-exp performances improve. The integration of 10 cm and 30 cm SM data yields performance scores better than using the sensor at 10 cm and 30 cm depth alone. The lagged response of 30 cm SM sensor has a slight influence on the results. In addition, the major contribution to the estimated rainfall is provided by the term incorporating the SM variations (similar to 85%), followed by the SR (12%), which is different from the hypothesis of neglecting SR made in the classical SM2RAIN. By comparing the results obtained by SM2RAIN and SM2RAIN-exp, SM2RAIN-exp is proved more stable and accurate. The recognition of the more suitable soil depth needed for obtaining good results, and of the important SR contribution, could help to clarify some important aspects related to the usage of satellite surface SM data for estimating rainfall.

AB The effects of urbanization and scales on submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) remain poorly understood. Here, we used radium isotopes to quantify SGD-derived fluxes of nitrogen, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into Sydney Harbour estuary, Australia. Sydney is the most populated city of Oceania, with several localised cases of historical groundwater pollution. We sampled top and bottom waters at the harbour scale (similar to 20 km) and also at four small scale embayments (similar to 2 km). A decreasing gradient in radium isotope concentrations from upstream to downstream was observed. Mass balances constructed with Ra-224, Ra-223, and Ra-226 revealed that total SGD ranged from 42 to 121 x 10(4) m(3) d(-1) depending on assumptions and isotope. These fluxes were related mostly to saline SGD (recirculated seawater), and are equivalent to > 60 times the mean annual freshwater river discharge into Sydney Harbour (0.68 x 10(4) m(3) d(-1)). The estimated SGD rates (2.2 +/- 1.5 cm d(-1)) were comparable to the global average radium-derived-SGD in other urban estuaries (similar to 3.1 cm d(-1)). No obvious relationships were observed between SGD and scale in Sydney Harbour. However, higher SGD rates estimated for embayments closer to the ocean indicate that a combination of waves, tides and urbanization control SGD. SGD derived fluxes exceeded maximum riverine nutrient fluxes by a factor of 2 for DOC, 6 for PO43-, 40 for NH4+ and 1.3 for NOx. Previous work has suggested that nutrients enter Sydney Harbour primarily through rivers or stormwater following episodic rain events. Our results imply that diffuse saline SGD can also be an important but overlooked source of nutrients, potentially sustaining primary productivity in times of no river flow.

AB Rivers are an important source of CO2 to the atmosphere, however, mountainous rivers and streams with high emission rates are not well studied particularly in China. We report the first detailed investigation on monsoonal mountainous rivers in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region, with a focus on the riverine CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)), CO2 degassing and their potential controls. The pCO(2) levels ranged from 50 to 6019 mu atm with averages of 1573 (SD. +/- 1060) in dry Autumn and 1276 (SD. +/- 1166) mu atm in wet Summer seasons. 94% of samples were supersaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium (410 mu atm). Monsoonal precipitation controlled pCO(2) seasonality, with both the maximal and minimal levels occurring in the wet season, and showing the overall effects of dilution. Riverine pCO(2) could be predicted better in the dry season using pH, DO% and DTP, whereas pH and DOC were better predictors in the wet season. We conclude that in-situ respiration of allochthonous organic carbon, rather than photosynthesis, resulted in negative relationships between pCO(2) and DO and pH, and thus CO2 supersaturation. Photosynthetic primary production was effectively limited by rapid flow velocity and short residence time. The estimated water-to-air CO2 emission rate in the TGR rivers was 350 319 in the Autumn and lower, yet more variable at 326 439 mmol/m(2)/d in Summer. Our calculated CO2 areal fluxes were in the upper-level magnitude of published data, demonstrating the importance of mountainous rivers and streams as a global greenhouse gas source, and urgency for more detailed studies on CO2 degassing, to address a global data gap for these environments.

AB Streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing of mountain rivers are susceptible to climate change. Trends and variability in streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in four mountain basins in the southern Tianshan were analyzed in this study. Streamflow trends were detected by Mann-Kendall tests and changes in snowmelt runoff timing were analyzed based on the winter/spring snowmelt runoff center time (WSCT). Pearson's correlation coefficient was further calculated to analyze the relationships between climate variables, streamflow and WSCT. Annual streamflow increased significantly in past decades in the southern Tianshan, especially in spring and winter months. However, the relations between streamflow and temperature/precipitation depend on the different streamflow generation processes. Annual precipitation plays a vital role in controlling recharge in the Toxkon basin, while the Kaidu and Huangshuigou basins are governed by both precipitation and temperature. Seasonally, temperature has a strong effect on streamflow in autumn and winter, while summer streamflow appears more sensitive to changes in precipitation. However, temperature is the dominant factor for streamflow in the glacierized Kunmalik basin at annual and seasonal scales. An uptrend in streamflow begins in the 1990s at both annual and seasonal scales, which is generally consistent with temperature and precipitation fluctuations. Average WSCT dates in the Kaidu and Huangshuigou basins are earlier than in the Toxkon and Kunmalik basins, and shifted towards earlier dates since the mid-1980s in all the basins. It is plausible that WSCT dates are more sensitive to warmer temperature in spring period compared to precipitation, except for the Huangshuigou basin. Taken together, these findings are useful for applications in flood risk regulation, future hydropower projects and integrated water resources management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Characterizing the spatial and temporal variability of small scale runoff responses is essential to distributed hydrologic modeling. To explore the variability of runoff responses, we analyzed surface runoff hydrographs from 12 neighboring hillslopes in central Iowa, USA that were observed for 72 runoff events over a four-year period. These agricultural experimental hillslopes receive various prairie filter strip treatments and drain areas ranging from 0.48 to 3.19 ha. The distances between them vary from tens of meters to about 3 km. We compared the hydrographs from the remaining 11 hillslopes to the hydrograph at the benchmark hillslope (i.e., hillslope B6 with no treatment). The results showed that: (I) for any individual event in which noticeable surface runoff occurred, the hydrographs from these hillslopes had similar shapes but different magnitudes; (2) for any paired hillslopes, the shape similarity persisted, but the scaling factor (the regression slope between two flow series) changed across events; and (3) for any runoff event, no simple relationship exists between the spatial variation of the scaling factor and the slope, slope length, area, and prairie strip width at the footslope of the hillslopes. Interestingly, we found that for 9 out of the 11 paired hillslopes, 40-70% of the temporal variation in the scaling factors can be explained by the antecedent wetness condition and the maximum hourly rain accumulation. These results suggest that the small-scale surface runoff responses are spatially variable but organized linearly, i.e., shape similarity (or linearity) in space is another feature of the small-scale runoff process. This phenomenon seems to result from the spatial vicinity and small-scale spatial variability of rainfall intensity and antecedent soil moisture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large scale climate phenomena can provide valuable information for regional climate and streamflow in many parts of the world. Several climate phenomena may impact a given area and their value for providing information on streamflow is dependent on first establishing the local relationship. This study was conducted to establish the individual and coupled impacts of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on streamflow in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river basin. Differences in annual and seasonal streamflow using two unimpaired streamflow datasets based on the phase(s) of ENSO, the PDO, and the AMO were evaluated using the nonparametric rank-sum test. Few statistical differences were found for the individual impacts of ENSO and the PDO on annual and seasonal streamflow; differences based on ENSO were largely confined to the southern portion of the basin. Significant differences in annual streamflow based on the AMO were largely confined to the northern half of the basin. Differences in seasonal streamflow based on the AMO were found for much of the year in the northern portion of the basin but were confined to the winter season in the southern portion. Significant differences in annual and seasonal streamflow were found between the La Nina/positive AMO phase and the El Nino/negative AMO phase, between the positive AMO/negative PDO phase and the negative AMO/negative PDO phase, and there appears to be a modulation of the impacts of La Nina by the phase of the AMO. A greater number of stations and a greater magnitude of significant differences were found for the coupled impacts than for the individual impacts of ENSO, the PDO, and the AMO; indicating the importance of the coupled impacts on regional streamflow when establishing the role of annual, decadal, and multidecadal climate variability.

AB This paper presents a simple analytical solution for estimating air permeability using the test data obtained by a falling-pressure method in laboratory. The perimeter of the column-shaped sample is fixed in a steel cylinder with the upper sample surface open to the atmosphere. The lower surface of the sample and the cylinder form an air chamber. A water manometer is connected to the air chamber to measure the air pressure inside after the chamber is pressurized. The data of pressure versus time in the air chamber are recorded and analyzed. An approximate analytical solution is derived to describe the pressure-time relationship in the air chamber. The air permeability can be easily estimated using the approximate analytical solution based on the linear least-squares fitting to the recorded pressure-time test data. This method is used to estimate the falling-pressure test data of 15 asphalt samples. The agreement between the test data and the analytical prediction is satisfactory for all the samples. To investigate the error caused by the approximate analytical solution, the air permeabilities are also estimated based on fully numerical solutions. The permeability values obtained from analytical and numerical solutions are very close. The maximum relative error is less than 6% for samples with more than five pressure-time records. A quantitative condition is given under which the analytical solution applies with negligible estimation error. Compared with the common, steady-state method for measuring air permeability, the falling-pressure method has its advantages such as simplicity and economy. The steady-state method has to measure the air flux through the sample, while the falling-pressure method does not. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The profile characteristics and the temporal dynamics of soil moisture variation were studied at 26 locations in Da Nangou catchment (3.5 km(2)) in the loess area of China. Soil moisture measurements were performed biweekly at five depths in the soil profile(0-5, 10-15, 20-25, 40-45 and 70-75 cm) from May to October 1998 using Delta-T theta probe. Soil moisture profile type and temporal variation type and their relationship to topography and land use were identified by detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) and correlation analysis. The profile distribution of time-averaged soil moisture content can be classified into three types i.e. decreasing-type, waving-type and increasing-type. The profile features of soil moisture (e.g. profile gradient and profile variability) are influenced by different environmental factors. The profile type of soil moisture is only attributed to land use while profile gradient and profile variability of soil moisture is mainly related to land use and topography (e.g. landform type and slope). The temporal dynamics of layer-averaged soil moisture content is grouped into three types including three-peak type, synchro-four-peak type and lagged-four-peak type. These types are controlled by topography rather than by land use. The temporal dynamic type of soil moisture shows significant correlation with relative elevation, slope, aspect, while temporal variance displays significant relation with slope shape. The mean soil moisture is related to both the profile and dynamics features of soil moisture and is controlled by both land use and topography (e.g. aspect, position, slope and relative elevation). The spatial variability of soil moisture across landscape varies with both soil depths and temporal evolution. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatland vulnerability to wildfire disturbance has been shown to vary as a function of hummock and hollow microforms and vadose zone hydrology, with low-lying hollow microforms most susceptible to deep combustion of peat. To better understand how this microform induced pattern of burning alters vadose water storage, pore-water pressure, and water table relationships, we examined a paired burned and unburned peatland in the boreal plain region of north central Alberta. Water table response to rain events increased significantly after wildfire, resulting in a more variable unsaturated zone thickness that was more responsive to smaller rain events. Water storage losses in the vadose zone occurred primarily at depths greater than 15 cm. Large peat surface water loss occurred in hummock microforms in the early spring due to the presence of unsaturated frozen peat at depth, likely a result of a vapour gradient from the unfrozen peat into the frozen peat underneath. During this period, the loss of water storage in the vadose zone satisfied up to 25% of daily evaporative demand, compared to only 3-5% during ice-free periods. A similar but less severe drying was observed late in summer, with burned hummocks the most vulnerable with high pore-water pressures. The enhanced surface drying observed is a precursor to high pore-water pressure conditions that inhibit Sphagnum regeneration. Our observations point to a paradox where the hummocks, being most resistant to combustion, are themselves most prone to high pore-water pressures following wildfire. The harsher hummock environment may contribute to the observed delay in post-fire Sphagnum regeneration in hummocks compared to hollows. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Globally, the large rivers export amounts of particulate nitrogen (PN) to the ocean, and studying the source and biogeochemical processes of the PN in the large river is important to regional/global N budget and cycle. However, the source apportionments and transformations of the PN along the Yangtze River remain unclear. Here, the elemental and isotopic compositions (N%, delta N-15 and delta C-13 value) of suspended particulate N (SPN) and surface sediment N (SSN) were determined in the wet and dry seasons along the Yangtze River, to investigate the seasonal and spatial variation in sources apportionments and transformations of the PN. In the wet season, the delta N-15 and PN content (%) of SPN increased from the headwater stream (2.3 +/- 3.9 %o and 0.12 +/- 0.04 %, respectively) to the lower stream (6.8 +/- 2.4 %o and 0.47 +/- 0.41 %, respectively) due to the imported anthro-pogenic N into the downriver section, while there was no significant change in the dry season. There were no distinctly spatial and seasonal variations in the source apportionment of SPN. Phytoplankton was identified as the dominant source of the SPN (42.3-56.9 %), which is probably the result of reducing soil erosion, reservoir construction, rapid urbanization and development of freshwater aquaculture. Terrestrial soil was the major source of SSN (34.5-49.8 %). Furthermore, the significant relationship between the delta N-15-SPN values and NO3- concentrations, as well as the lower delta N-15-SPN value compared to that of delta N-15-NO3, indicated a strong assimi-lation process of nitrate during phytoplankton growth. Meanwhile, most of the SSN showed lower C and N concentrations and higher delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, compared to those of the SPN samples at the corresponding sampling sites, which might be due to the SSN degradation. Our findings provided valuable information for the N cycle in the Yangtze River and underlined the importance of phytoplankton in the PN inputs.

AB Under global warming, extreme hydrological events are experiencing increasingly violent fluctuations. Investigating changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation (EP) events is particularly critical for understanding the hydrological response to climate change. Based on high-precision and long-term daily grid precipitation data obtained from Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources (APHRODITE), 25 EP indices were examined for the Tienshan Mountains region of Central Asia (TMCA). Here, the relationship between EP and associated large-scale climate teleconnections is revealed by using a series of approaches such as trend analysis and the geographical detector method (GMD), a statistical tool to measure and attribute spatial stratified heterogeneity. The results show an overall increase in EP during 1951-2014, as reflected in the 25 indices. Furthermore, the number of consecutive dry days (CDD) decreased from 87.02 to 69.35 while the number of consecutive wet days (CWD) increased from 3.89 to 4.61. Meanwhile, the increasing trend of total precipitation (PRCPTOT) was 18.43 mm/10a, and changes in EP frequency were shown to increase with event rareness. For R95p, the observed changes in frequency are 34.46%, but these jump to 96.58% for R99p. Moreover, the study also notes that changes in EP are elevation-dependent, with middle altitude areas (1500-3500 m) being most sensitive to change rates. As well, the study reveals that the occurrence of EP responds non-linearly to climatic teleconnections, and that the combined effect of two factors generally make much larger contributions to EP than the summation of individual factors. Further analyses indicate strong zonal circulation at 500 hPa, 1000 hPa potential height increases airflow from west to east. And the weakening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon accompanied by the westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high and the increase in Mongolian anticyclone activity all bring sufficient exogenous water vapor from the North Atlantic and Indian Ocean to the TMCA.

AB Gully headcut erosion is recognized as the primary process of gully erosion and is the main contributor to sediment yield of gully erosion. However, the proportion of jet flow and on-wall flow induced by headcut and its effects on soil loss and plunge pool morphology are still unclear. A simulated flow-scouring experiment was conducted to explore the proportion of jet flow and on-wall flow and their contributions to soil loss and the effect of on-wall flow erosion on plunge pool morphology under different flow discharge (q(0) = 3.0-7.2 m(3) h(-1)) and headwall height (H-0 = 0.3-1.2 m) conditions. Our results showed that jet flow and on-wall flow accounted 15.7% - 22.6% and 77.4% - 84.3% of total flow volume upstream headcut, respectively. Jet flow, on-wall flow and their interaction contributed 53.5%, 34.9% and 11.6% of total soil loss amount, respectively. Furthermore, H-0 exhibited greater effect on soil loss caused by jet flow and its interaction with on-wall flow, but the soil loss caused by on-wall was mainly controlled by q(0). The width and depth of plunge pool logarithmically increased with scouring time, and the q(0) and H-0 significantly affected the development of plunge pool morphology. On-wall flow reduced plunge pool depth by 27.8%-71.4%, and it weakened plunge pool width by 24.3%-57.3% only under H-0 of 0.3-0.9 m, but for H-0 of 1.2 m and q(0) of >4.8 m(3) h(-1), it improved the plunge pool width by 7.5%. The energy consumption of jet flow showed the closest relationship with plunge pool morphology. The concentrated flow upstream gully head exhibited the stronger effect on plunge pool morphology than H-0. This study is helpful to deepen the understanding of gully erosion mechanism and provide scientific reference for the design of gully erosion prevention and control measures.

AB The changes in maximum and minimum temperature, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation of future bi-decades, i.e., 2020-2040, 2040-2060, 2060-2080 and 2080-2100 with the corresponding observed baseline datasets (1991-2016) were analyzed for the Jhelum catchment, western Himalayas, using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 of Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4). Maximum and minimum temperature projections indicated a rise of 1.18 degrees C to 3.29 degrees C and 1.30 degrees C to 2.92 degrees C under RCP 4.5, and 3.58 degrees C to 7.22 degrees C and 3.38 degrees C to 6.92 degrees C under RCP 8.5, respectively, relative to the baseline period. Precipitation shows a decline of 14.34 mm, 9.60 mm, 4.19 mm and 15.62 mm under RCP 4.5, whereas RCP 8.5 shows an incline of 7.45 mm, 12.37 mm, 22.19 mm, and 6.86 mm during 2040s, 2060s, 2080s and 2100s, respectively, as compared to the baseline period. For the months of May to September, both the RCPs indicated a decrease in PET values. Snow cover area (SCA) computed from MODIS Snow Cover 8-Day L3 Global 500 m Grid (MOD10A2) datasets over a period of 2002 to 2016, depicted a negative relationship with river runoff, with strong negative coefficient of -0.88 for the year 2012.
   The impact of these climate change projections were computed on the hydrology of Jhelum catchment using Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Comparison among the future bi-decades, show increasing trend of precipitation under both the RCPs from 2020 to 2080, then slightly decreases during 2080-2100. Similar trend was exhibited by runoff projections, viz. runoff increases till 2080 and decreases afterwards under both the RCP emission scenarios. Temperature and runoff shows relatively higher values under RCP 8.5, than RCP 4.5. Overall, results indicated a strong influence of precipitation projections on runoff of Jhelum catchment.

AB The severity of river eutrophication is influenced by multiple stressors which reflect a wide-ranging variety of drivers encompassing land management, population growth and climatic effects. Experimental studies have successfully identified response to single or paired stressors under controlled conditions in small streams but have limited capability to characterise larger systems influenced by a wider variety of stressors. Here, a physics-based water quality model of the River Thames (UK) is used to explore the impacts of water temperature, phosphate concentration, river flow, urbanisation and riparian shading on indicators of chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen concentration by way of a sensitivity analysis. To understand the impact of model structural uncertainty, results are presented from two alternative formulations of the biological response. All outputs from each unique combination of stressors are presented in one graphic comprising multiple sub-plots that display the results of thousands of model runs simultaneously. Consequently, graphical analysis allows us to pinpoint under what circumstances reductions in key variables representing management-related stressors (i.e. lowering phosphorus concentrations and establishing riparian shading) may act synergistically, antagonistically or simply in an additive manner. Furthermore, we identify how these relationships may vary under different river flow and water temperature regimes and changes in abstraction and effluent discharge rates, to indicate the likely influence of future climate and population growth. Response can vary markedly depending on the choice of biological model and also changes considerably downstream along the river system. Chlorophyll indicators consistently show antagonistic responses to reduction in stressors whereas dissolved oxygen indicators show varied and complex responses. As expected, increases in phosphorus loading are detrimental, but so too are large decreases. Whilst the analysis suggests that urbanisation impacts are in general not expected to be large, changes in water demand brought about by population growth have disproportionate effects at low flows. These may result in increased incidence of very low dissolved oxygen concentrations which damage the health of the ecosystem.

AB Joint monitoring of the variations of glaciers and lakes within a basin is essential for an accurate understanding of region-wide climate change and the water cycle process. The central Kunlun-KekeXili region is an ideal experimental field due to the wide distribution of glaciers and lakes. In this study, we first investigated the glacier mass balance of 2000-2015/16 for seven major glacier clusters by utilizing high-resolution SPOT-6/7 stereo imagery and the SRTM DEM. The final results revealed an overall mass balance of - 0.16 +/- 0.05 m w.e./a. for the study region (with a total glacier area of 967 km(2)). Secondly, ICESat/GLAS altimetry data were used to quantify the water-level change of 2003-2008/09 for the two largest glacier-fed closed lakes (i.e., LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake) in this region. Based on this, we applied a strategy which establishes the statistical relationship between the lake area change and the lake water-level change for 2003-2008/09 to estimate the specific water level using the corresponding lake area. We then further calculated the variation in lake water storage between 2000 and 2015. The results showed that the water storage of LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake increased by 1.82 +/- 0.14 km(3) and 1.90 +/- 0.38 km(3), respectively. For each lake basin, meanwhile, the glaciers lost - 0.18 +/- 0.03 km(3) and - 0.21 +/- 0.04 km(3) of water, accounting for 9.9% and 11.1% of the increase in lake water storage for LexieWudan Lake and KekeXili Lake, respectively. Our results not only demonstrate that glacier meltwater has only a limited impact on the lake expansion in this region, but they also provide new evidence for the warming and wetting process of the climate in the northern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB For some time, ecologists have attempted to make generalizations concerning how disturbances influence natural ecosystems, especially river systems. The existing literature suggests that dams homogenize the hydrologic variability of rivers. However, this might insinuate that dams affect river systems similarly despite a large gradient in natural hydrologic character. In order to evaluate patterns in dam-regulated hydrology and associated ecological relationships, a broad framework is needed. Flow classes, or groups of streams that share similar hydrology, may provide a framework to evaluate the relative effects of dam regulation on natural flow dynamics. The purpose of this study was to use a regional flow classification as the foundation for evaluating patterns of hydrologic alteration due to dams and to determine if the response of rivers to regulation was specific to different flow classes. We used the US Geological Survey (USGS) database to access discharge information for 284 unregulated and 117 regulated gage records. For each record, we calculated 44 hydrologic statistics, including the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. We used a sub-regional flow classification for eight states as a way to stratify unregulated and regulated streams into comparable units. In general, our results showed that dam regulation generally had stronger effects on hydrologic indices than other disturbances when models were stratified by flow class: however, the effects of urbanization, withdrawals, and fragmentation, at times, were comparable or exceeded the effects of dam regulation. In agreement with the existing literature, maximum flows, flow variability, and rise rates were lower whereas minimum flows and reversals were higher in dam regulated streams. However, the response of monthly and seasonal flows, flow predictability, and baseflows were variable depending on flow class membership. Principal components analysis showed that regulated streams occupied a larger multivariate space than unregulated streams, which suggests that dams may not homogenize all river systems, but may move them outside the bounds of normal river function. Ultimately, our results suggest that flow classes provide a suitable framework to generalize patterns in hydrologic alterations due to dam regulation. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY; WAVE METHOD; GPR DATA; INVERSION; SCALE
AB Efficient water management, crop yield variability estimation and prediction of contaminant transport require some measurement of soil water content variation through time and space. This study focused on the estimation of spatio-temporal variability of volumetric soil water content (theta(v)) in raised bed agricultural fields using ground penetrating radar (GPR), comparison of GPR method with gravimetric sampling data and development of 2D maps of theta(v). The GPR system (pulse EKKO Pro) with 200 MHz antennas was used to collect data on approximately 1.0 m wide and 13.0 m long raised beds of about 0.1 m height cultivated with vegetables. Transillumination Zero Offset Profile (Trans ZOP) and Transillumination Multiple Offset Gather (Trans MOG) GPR survey modes which are classically used as borehole GPR method were employed as a surface GPR method. In each of these survey modes, the direct ground wave travel time was measured. The theta(v) at each Trans ZOP and Trans MOG location was calculated by first converting the electromagnetic (EM) wave velocity into soil dielectric permittivity and then to theta(v) using a standard empirical relationship. The results revealed that the spatio-temporal variability of theta(v) in raised bed agricultural fields could be estimated using the Trans ZOP and Trans MOG GPR survey modes. The GPR estimated theta(v) and gravimetrically measured soil water content (theta(g)) were not significantly different (P = 0.272). The correlation coefficient was 0.87, the root mean square error was 0.0184 m(3)/m(3) and the average error was 0.20% between the two methods. The Trans MOG survey data allowed us to create plan view maps (2D) of the theta(v) variation which could not be obtained from the Trans ZOP data. No statistical difference (P = 0.053) was found between the Trans ZOP and average Trans MOG values. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Three years of observations of groundwater elevations, ocean tides, surge, and waves, and rainfall are used to study coastal groundwater-driven flooding along the ocean side of a barrier island. Increases in surge and wave-driven water levels (setup) during 26 ocean storms with little rainfall, including the passage of 3 hurricanes, caused O(1 m) increases in groundwater heads under the dunes on the ocean side of the island, nearly double previously reported magnitudes. The inland propagation of the resulting pulses in groundwater levels is consistent with an analytical model (without recharge) based on shallow aquifer theory (Nash Sutcliffe model efficiencies of >0.7, maximum water-table level estimates within 0.1 m of observations). Infiltration of precipitation results in approximately a threefold increase in the groundwater level relative to the amount of rainfall. The analytical model (with recharge) driven with estimated ocean shoreline water levels (based on the 36-hr-averaged offshore tide, surge, and wave height) and measured precipitation predicts the maximum water-table height within 0.15 m of that observed across the barrier island during Hurricane Matthew, which was the only wave event during the 3-yr data set with more than 0.1 m rainfall.
   Citizen-science reports from a smartphone app (iFlood) are used to evaluate the regional application of the model. Twenty-five ocean-side reports associated with 7 ocean storms (6 of which had minimal rainfall) between Sept 2019 and Feb 2020 showed flooding on natural (permeable) land surfaces along 70 km of the northern Outer Banks barrier island, from Corolla to Rodanthe, NC. The analytical model (with recharge) predicts flooding that is consistent with the timing and location for 19 of the 25 reports. Applying the model regionally suggests that more than 10% of the land area on the ocean side of the northern Outer Banks would be inundated by coastal groundwater even in the absence of rainfall for an ocean storm that generates a 2.25 m increase in the shoreline water level.

TI Application of Modified Cloud Model-Level Eigenvalue Method in water
   quality evaluation
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Water quality evaluation; Cloud model; Level Eigenvalue Method
AB Groundwater quality is affected by numerous uncertain factors, and the evaluation process is liable to randomness and fuzziness. To evaluate the quality of groundwater effectively, this study proposed a multi-index evaluation system termed the Modified Cloud Model-Level Eigenvalue Method (MCM-LEM) model, which is based on cloud model theory. In this evaluation system, the water quality was classified into five levels and several parameters were selected, while the CRITIC objective weight method is used to calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter, before an One-dimensional Normal Cloud Model and a Multi-dimensional Normal Cloud Model are established to obtain the membership degree of water samples pertaining to each water quality level. Finally, the LEM was used to assess the water quality level. In this study, taking the groundwater in the urban area of Jilin City as an example, seven evaluation parameters were selected for water quality evaluation, and the water quality evaluation results using the MCM-LEM model were compared with those obtained via the Single Factor Evaluation Method, the Nemerow Index Method and the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method. The evaluation results obtained via the MCM-LEM model were largely consistent with those obtained via the other methods. Compared with the other methods, the MCM-LEM model can comprehensively consider the fuzziness and randomness, as well as the correlation between them; can avoid complex function calculations; and can provide more scientific and objective evaluation results. Furthermore, compared with the One-dimensional Normal Cloud Model, the Multi-dimensional Normal Cloud Model comprehensively considers multiple evaluation parameters, which simplifies the modeling process and reduces the calculation times for the membership degree. Meanwhile, using the LEM to determine the water quality level not only overcomes the inapplicability of the Maximum Membership Degree Principle, but also allows for assessing the relative advantages and disadvantages of different water samples of the same level. The proposed method can be used to the evaluation of the groundwater quality in other areas, enabling the planning and management of groundwater resources.

AB The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and Indian summer monsoon (ISM) are two interactive climate systems dominating the moisture variability of Monsoon Asia. However, ISM-EASM interactions and their effects on regional moisture dynamics remain unclear. This study investigated the spatiotemporal characteristics of monsoon-related hydroclimate variability by establishing a new tree-ring oxygen isotope ratio (delta O-18(tree)) network of eight delta O-18(tree) records covering the last 150 years in southern China, which differs from previous studies that used data from individual sites. The delta O-18(tree) chronologies were found to be sensitive to regional hydroclimatic changes during the monsoon season. The delta O-18(tree) network indicated an east-west clustering pattern in the ISM-EASM transitional zone, which demonstrates an asynchrony in d18Otree variability in the west and east of this region. Regional variability of the west and east delta O-18(tree) modes reflected the different moisture signals, as indicated by their significant correlations with modern observations and paleo-delta O-18 records in disparate upstream regions of moisture transport (the Indochina Peninsula and Southeast China). This finding was confirmed by the east-west distinct pattern of spatial isotopic depletion of monsoon rainfall that originates from coastal areas of tropical oceans (Bay of Bengal and South China Sea) to the study area, as well as the consistent present-day pattern of atmospheric vapor transport during the monsoon season. In addition, the west and east modes exhibited stronger associations with ISM variability, whereas the east-west delta O-18(tree) gradient captured the EASM-related hydroclimatic signal, suggesting that summer moisture variability in the ISM-EASM transitional zone was regulated more by ISM than by EASM during the last 150 years. The relationships between delta O-18(tree) and large-scale ocean-atmosphere interaction modes revealed that the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dominantly modulates delta O-18(tree) variability across southern China.

AB Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have been used for hydrological and water resources modelling for several decades, where their calibration ("training") has received much attention. The aim of automated calibration processes is to identify values of the model parameters that minimize an error measure between model outputs and corresponding measured values. The degree of difficulty associated with this process is a function of the nature of the relationship between changes in values of model parameters and corresponding changes in the error measure (i.e. the features of the error surface) and the automated method used to identify the combination of model parameters that minimizes the error measure (i.e. the optimization method used to find the global optimum in the error surface). While the impact of different optimization methods has been studied extensively, how the features of the error surface change for different model structures has not. In this paper, it is demonstrated that Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) metrics can be used successfully to characterize the features of the error surfaces of ANN models, thereby helping to explain the reasons for an increase or decrease in calibration difficulty, and in doing so, shedding new light on findings in existing literature. Results show that the error surfaces of single-layer multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with fewer hidden nodes have a more well-defined overall shape and have fewer local optima, while the error surfaces of single-layer MLPs with a larger numbers of hidden nodes are flatter and have many distributed, deep local optima. Consequently, single-layer MLPs with a smaller number of hidden nodes can be calibrated successfully using gradient-based methods, such as the back-propagation algorithm, whereas single-layer MLPs with a relatively large number of hidden nodes are best calibrated using hybrid approaches that go beyond basic gradient-based methods (for example, combination of global-based evolutionary algorithms coupled with a local search).

AB Canopy interception loss is a key component of forest hydrological cycle that determine the amount of net rainfall reaching forest floor together with drought/climate stressors affecting dryland forest plantations. A good understanding of the relationship between canopy interception loss and forest management such as thinning is important for improved watershed management and ecological services. In this study, we measured event-based rainfall partitioning for a thinned (TH, with 38% basal area removed) and a control (CT) Robinia pseudoacacia forest plantation during leafed and leafless seasons in 2015 in the semiarid Loess Plateau region in China. Interception loss from both forest plots were simulated using the Revised Gash Analytical Model (RGAM) and the WiMo model. The results showed that observed annual throughfall, stemflow and interception loss were respectively 80.8%, 1.7% and 17.5% of the gross rainfall under CT. The corresponding values under TH were 87.9%, 0.8% and 11.3%, respectively. The RGAM and WiMo models were well calibrated and validated using filed data collected in leafed and leafless seasons. The analyses suggested that models accurately predicated interception loss under both CT and TH conditions and captured seasonal variations in canopy and meteorological parameters. The RGAM model was most sensitive to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity, and canopy storage capacity in leafed season, and to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity in leafless season. Moreover, 37.2% and 42.1% of the interception in leafed season evaporated from the canopy respectively during rainfall event and after rainfall. The corresponding values for leafless season were respectively 49.3% and 22.4%. Overall, the performance of the optimized RGAM and WiMo models were satisfactory with respect to modeling error ( - 6.9 - - 2.9%) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (0.80-0.94), although that of the optimized RGAM model was slightly superior to WiMo model. The models would facilitate the implementation of water-oriented management in semiarid forest plantations through a more accurate simulation of the impact of thinning on interception loss.

AB River network coding is important for hydrological model on the aspects of water cycles simulation, water resources evaluation and extreme hydrological events forecast. However, the existing river network coding methods had several disadvantages, such as, the river network coding structure is too complex to understand, the river network topology is difficult to identify, the river network coding capacity is limited. To overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, this paper proposed a new topological and hierarchical river coding method based on the river network created by the DEM (Digital Elevation Method) data and ArcGIS software. This method systematically defines the river levels based on the hydrology structure from outlet to source. The river directly flows into the watershed outlet is river L1, the branch of river L1 with a certain catchment area is river L2, the branch of L2 with a certain catchment area is river L3, and so on. Secondly, we proposed a flexible coding scheme that encode the river segments with pure digital numbers hierarchically. Taking the two-digits scheme for example, the L1 river segments are coded with a sequence number, such as [01], [02], [03], [...]. The L2 river segments inherit the river code from the L1 stem river segment, add a serial of self-order numbers (01, 02, 03, ......) from the junction to the river source, and become [0101], [0102], [0103], [...]. The process of coding the river segments at subsequent level is similar. Finally, this new coding method was programmed in Matlab software, and successfully examined in the Amazon River basin, the world's largest watershed, as a case study. The results show that the new method is competent for easily controlling the river level and river segment density, flexibly adjusting the code digital numbers to fit different basins with abundant or little rivers, easily plotting the topological relationship, automatically encoding by computer program and easily understood. In a word, this study is a useful attempt to create new river network coding method, and it also has positive significance to promote the hydrological simulation research.

AB Urban runoff contains various pollutants and has the potential of deteriorating the quality of aquatic ecosystems. In this study our objective is to shed light on the factors that control the runoff water quality in urbanized catchments. The effects of runoff event characteristics, land use type and catchment imperviousness on event mass loads (EML) and event mean concentrations (EMC) were studied during warm and cold periods in three study catchments (6.1, 6.5 and 12.6 ha in size) in the city of Lahti, Finland. Runoff and rainfall were measured continuously for two years at each catchment. Runoff samples were taken for total nutrients (tot-P and tot-N), total suspended solids (TSS), heavy metals (Zn, Cr, Al, Co, Ni, Cu, Pb, Mn) and total organic carbon (TOC). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (SMLR) was used to identify general relationships between the following variables: event water quality, runoff event characteristics and catchment characteristics. In general, the studied variables explained 50-90% of the EMLs but only 30-60% of the EMCs, with runoff duration having an important role in most of the SMLR models. Mean runoff intensity or peak flow was also often included in the runoff quality models. Yet, the importance (being the first, second or third best) and role (negative or positive impact) of the explanatory variables varied between the cold and warm period. Land use type often explained cold period concentrations, but imperviousness alone explained EMCs weakly. As for EMLs, the influence of imperviousness and/or land use was season and pollutant dependent. The study suggests that pollutant loads can be - throughout the year - adequately predicted by runoff characteristics given that seasonal differences are taken into account. Although pollutant concentrations were sensitive to variation in seasonal and catchment conditions as well, the accurate estimation of EMCs would require a more complete set of explanatory factors than used in this study.

AB There are strong ties between land cover patterns and soil erosion and sediment yield in watersheds. The spatial configuration of land cover has recently become an important aspect of the study of geomorphological processes related to erosion within watersheds. Many studies have used multivariate regression techniques to explore the response of soil erosion and sediment yield to land cover patterns in watersheds. However, many landscape metrics are highly correlated and may result in redundancy, which violates the assumptions of a traditional least-squares approach, thus leading to singular solutions or otherwise biased parameter estimates and confidence intervals. Here, we investigated the landscape patterns within watersheds in the Upper Du River watershed (8973 km(2)) in China and examined how the spatial patterns of land cover are related to the soil erosion and sediment yield of watersheds using hydrological modeling and partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The results indicate that the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield are closely associated with the land cover patterns. At the landscape level, landscape characteristics, such as Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), aggregation index (AI), largest patch index (LPI), contagion (CONTAG), and patch cohesion index (COHESION), were identified as the primary metrics controlling the watershed soil erosion and sediment yield. The landscape characteristics in watersheds could account for as much as 65% and 74% of the variation in soil erosion and sediment yield, respectively. Greater interspersion and an increased number of patch land cover types may significantly accelerate soil erosion and increase sediment export. PLSR can be used to simply determine the relationships between land-cover patterns and watershed soil erosion and sediment yield, providing quantitative information to allow decision makers to make better choices regarding landscape planning. With readily available remote sensing data and rapid developments in geographic information system (GIS) technology, this practical and simple PLSR approach could be applied to a variety of other watersheds.

AB Transient storage models are commonly used to simulate solute transport in streams to characterize hydrologic controls on biogeochemical cycling. Recently, 2-storage zone (2-SZ) models have been developed to represent in-channel surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS) separately to overcome the limitations of single storage zone (1-SZ) models. To advance biogeochemical models, we seek to separate the effects of these storage zones on solute fate and cycling in streams. Here we compare and contrast the application and interpretations from two model structures that include STS and HTS storage: a competing model structure, where both zones are connected to the stream at the same location and the stream interacts with the STS and HTS separately, and a nested model structure, where STS is an intermediary between the stream and HTS. We adapt common residence time metrics used to compare single transient storage models for the competing and nested 2-SZ models. As a test case, we investigated the transient storage characteristics of a first-order stream in Pennsylvania, using 1-SZ, nested 2-SZ, and competing 2-SZ model configurations at several different flow conditions. While both 2-SZ models fit the observed STS and in-stream breakthrough curves well, calibrated model parameters and solute molecule travel paths differ, as evident by the faster exchange rate displayed by the nested model, and therefore so does the interpretation of associated transient storage metrics and its relationship with biogeochemical cycling processes. In addition, a study of hypothetical zone-specific reaction rates was very illustrative of the differences in discrimination characterized by each model structure, particularly for the case where reactions would predominantly occur in the STS (i.e. photochemical reactions), because of the compounding effects to the HTS for the nested 2-SZ; however, for the case where reactions would predominantly occur in the HTS, the influence of model structure was found to be relegated only to the HTS.

AB In a complex environment such as karst systems, it is difficult to assess the relative contribution of the different components of the system to the hydrological system response, i.e. spring discharge. Not only is the saturated zone highly heterogeneous due to the presence of highly permeable conduits, but also the recharge processes. The latter are composed of rapid recharge components through shafts and solution channels and diffuse matrix infiltration, generating a highly complex, spatially and temporally variable input signal. The presented study reveals the importance of the compartments vegetation, soils, saturated zone and unsaturated zone. Therefore, the entire water cycle in the catchment area Gallusquelle spring (Southwest Germany) is modelled over a period of 10 years using the integrated hydrological modelling system Mike She by DHI (2007). Sensitivity analyses show that a few individual parameters, varied within physically plausible ranges, play an important role in reshaping the recessions and peaks of the recharge functions and consequently the spring discharge. Vegetation parameters especially the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the root depth as well as empirical parameters in the relationship of Kristensen and Jensen highly influence evapotranspiration, transpiration to evaporation ratios and recharge respectively. In the unsaturated zone, the type of the soil (mainly the hydraulic conductivity at saturation in the water retention and hydraulic retention curves) has an effect on the infiltration/evapotranspiration and recharge functions. Additionally in the unsaturated karst, the saturated moisture content is considered as a highly indicative parameter as it significantly affects the peaks and recessions of the recharge curve. At the level of the saturated zone the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix and highly conductive zone representing the conduit are dominant parameters influencing the spring response. Other intermediate significant parameters appear to influence the characteristics of the spring response yet to a smaller extent, as for instance bypass and the parameters alpha in the Van Genuchten relation for soil moisture content curves.

AB Ephemeral streams are common features of landscapes around the world, and are the predominant fluvial. environment in and zones. Current understanding of dryland riparian ecology is derived primarily from perennial stream environments, and little is known about the factors controlling vegetation along ephemeral streams. This study describes relationships between the physical characteristics of watersheds and stream reaches, and their effects on riparian plant communities, for 14 ephemeral stream reaches in the semi-arid southern Colorado Plateau, USA. Interactions of watershed properties produce gradients of hydro-geomorphic regimes throughout stream networks, which give rise to spatial patterns in the structure and composition of perennial woody plant and grass dominated communities. As watershed and network magnitudes increased, and basin slope decreased, stream reaches exhibited reduced erosive capacities and more attenuated alluvial groundwater variability. Decreased disturbance potential and increased moisture availability in the downstream direction was related to greater abundance of obligate riparian taxa, and increasing structural importance of shrub and tree species. Divisions in watershed and stream reach physical properties corresponded with riparian plant community types, implying that progress in dryland fluvial. ecology could be made from research within a watershed or network context. These concepts are integrated to form a stream classification system that describes functional linkages between watersheds, stream reaches, and riparian plant ecology. Type I streams drain watersheds less than 10 km(2), exhibit the greatest disturbance potential and most xeric alluvial groundwater regime, and are occupied by upland plant associations. Type II streams have watersheds between 10 and 100 km(2), and have more moderate shear stresses and more persistent alluvial groundwater. Plant communities consisting of a mix of upland and riparian species occur in Type II reaches. Type III reaches drain watersheds of more than 100 km(2) and hydrologic regimes are controlled mainly by upstream hydro-climatic conditions. These streams have the lowest bankfull, shear stresses and perennial water tables that span expansive floodplains. Wetland tree and shrub communities dominate Type III reaches, and upland plants are a minor ecological component. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stream water chemical concentrations from an undisturbed, temperate, old-growth Chilean forest were analyzed to gain insights into hydrological controls on watershed-scale losses of different nutrients and chemical elements. Our goal was to understand how hydrological and biogeochemical processes interact to control patterns of export of dissolved chemicals from these types of forested watersheds. The study is unique in that the monitored watershed lies in a part of the world that receives very little anthropogenic influence and this is the first study of its type in this part of the world. A small, densely forested, montane watershed was continuously monitored for stream discharge and precipitation and was sampled biweekly for stream-, precipitation-, and soil-water chemistry. Three different forms of hydrological controls were used to describe how concentrations of different elements changed as a function of increased stream water discharge: dilution of elements due to decreased relative contributions by baseflow sources, increased concentration due to enhanced hydrological access to elements in to shallow soil horizons, and no net effect, i.e. hydrologically constant. A hyperbolic relationship was used to describe element concentration as a function of stream discharge to quantify the variations for major ions, cations, and organic forms of nutrients. In general, this hydro-biogeochemical system showed the most distinct dilution and enhanced hydrological access for chemicals with large concentration differences between deep and shallow soil water. Deep soil water sources were most distinct for Ca2+ and Si, both of which demonstrated dilution. In contrast, variations in H+ concentrations resembled enhanced hydrological access indicating shallow soil sources, coupled with the consumption of acidity by weathering or cation exchange in deeper soil layers. Rainwater sometimes enhanced and sometimes tempered the observed trends. Potassium was the least hydrologically variable element (hydrologically constant) in this study, possibly due to strong biological mechanisms internal to the watershed. The approach used here is a simple method to identify the importance of hydrologic variations in controlling streamwater chemistry relative to internal biogeochemical sources and processes.

TI Performance assessment of Bayesian Causal Modelling for runoff temporal

AB A strong innovative tendency is nowadays emerging that largely comprises new hydrological modelling ap-proaches, based on Causal Reasoning through Probabilistic Graphical Modelling (PGM), because its abilit y to support probabilistic reasoning from data with uncertainty. These novel modelling frameworks are quite diverse and disperse not only in terms of techniques but also regarding its aims. It seems necessa r y to find a general and robust methodology for assessing its performance. This paper aims to provide a novel general methodolog y for assessing the performance of PGM based on Bayesian Causality for modelling and analysing the rivers runoff behaviour. For it, a structured four-step approach is developed and showed throughout the paper. The proposed methodology begins with the identification of the two main factors that condition the Bayesian Causal (BC) Modelling: the number of synthetic series (data amount ) and the number of intervals for probability distributions for training and learning processes. The developed analysis comprises the definition of three levels for the first factor and seven levels for the second one, as we l l as the design of an innovative stability framework that assesses the level of BC Modelling performance. Furthermore, it has been necessa r y to create-define two novel indexes, named "Similarity and Stability Indexes" from 21 scenarios arising from the combination of the levels of the both factors. The optimal combination of factors is identified through a bi-objectives recursive approach based on previous indexes. Main results drawn successfully show a high relationship between the level of modelling performance, measured in terms of stability, and the river runoff temporal behaviour, measured in terms of temporal dependence. This research may help water managers and engineers to develop more rigorous and robust hydrological causal modelling implementations.

AB Flooding is one of the most challenging weather-induced risks in urban areas. However, in a climate change perspective, significant gaps can still be observed in literature addressing the key role of rainfall input and related variability within urban flood impact models. The present research attempts to bridge this gap by investigating the effect of using a large ensemble of bias-corrected Euro-CORDEX climate projections on flood hazard estimations, with the goal of understanding the propagation of future climate variability in terms of flooding outputs for the urban environment. With this aim, a scenario analysis is performed for two return periods (10 and 200 years) building on nineteen climate projections for future horizon 2071-2100 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios by means of CADDIES Caflood inundation model, using a test case in the City of Naples (Italy). Model outcomes are investigated and discussed in terms of relevant metrics and indicators available in literature targeting both general hazards, evaluated in terms of runoff volumes and flooded areas, and sectoral hazards, specified by a number of relevant literature hazard classifications. Modelling outcomes are analysed and normalised with respect to baseline values representing current climate conditions to emphasize potential impacts of climate change. Results show that flood features increase more slowly than rainfall, and the relationship between rainfall and flood increase is linear, with decreasing slope with increasing return period. Furthermore, the spread in rainfall input due to the use of different climate projections does not inflate through the impact modelling stages, albeit a dependence on the indicators used to model flood impacts can be observed. The outcomes of the research can be of aid to managers, designers and policy makers to understand the impacts of climate change in floodprone urban areas and, in perspective, to adapt urban areas exploring the feasibility and effectiveness of solutions.

AB Concentration times in small and medium-sized basins (similar to 10-1000 km(2)) are commonly less than 24 h. Flood-forecasting models are thus required to provide simulations at high temporal resolutions (1 h-6 h), although time-series of input and runoff data with sufficient lengths are often only available at the daily temporal resolution, especially in developing countries. This has led to study the relationships of estimated parameter values at the temporal resolutions where they are needed from the temporal resolutions where they are available. This study presents a methodology to treat empirically model parameter dependencies on the temporal resolution of data in two small basins using a bucket-type hydrological model, HBV-light, and the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation approach for selecting its parameters. To avoid artefacts due to the numerical resolution or numerical method of the differential equations within the model, the model was consistently run using modelling time steps of one-hour regardless of the temporal resolution of the rainfall-runoff data. The distribution of the parameters calibrated at several temporal resolutions in the two basins did not show model parameter dependencies on the temporal resolution of data and the direct transferability of calibrated parameter sets (e.g., daily) for runoff simulations at other temporal resolutions for which they were not calibrated (e.g., 3 h or 6 h) resulted in a moderate (if any) decrease in model performance, in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe and volume-error efficiencies. The results of this study indicate that if sub-daily forcing data can be secured, flood forecasting in basins with sub-daily concentration times may be possible with model-parameter values calibrated from long time series of daily data. Further studies using more models and basins are required to test the generality of these results. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A controlled field experiment was conducted to provide data for a one-dimensional numerical model for simulating transient water flow, isotope transport, and heat transfer in the unsaturated zone (ODWISH). The experiment consisted of allowing water to evaporate from homogeneously packed sand columns and periodically sampling to observe changes in the distributions of moisture, temperature, and oxygen-18 enrichment. The peaks of the oxygen-18 distributions were used to determine the value of moisture content at liquid discontinuity, a parameter important for modeling water vapor flow. Modeling transient second-stage evaporation from soil necessitated implementing a retention relation Psi(theta) that is applicable for dry soils, above the evaporation front, where vapor flow is dominant. A retention model for dry soils was developed, connected to the Van Genuchten model and the resulting two-segment retention relation was implemented in the numerical model. The connection point for the retention relation is the moisture content at liquid discontinuity, which was also used in the numerical model to locate the evaporation front. Simulations showed that the ODWISH model reproduces reasonably well the experimental distributions of moisture content, isotopic enrichment, and temperature, and that the model accounts for the major processes involved in water movement in the shallow unsaturated zone and the associated isotope transport. The most significant discrepancies between the simulations and the experimental data can probably be attributed to inadequencies of the available two-segment Psi(theta) relationship over the wide range of pressure heads Psi encountered during the experiment. The ODWISH model was employed to test the sensitivity of the isotope profile development to diurnal variations in temperature and humidity. The results indicated that daily, or even weekly, averages are adequate for predicting isotope profile development.

AB Quantifying the impact of the streamflow forecast uncertainty on the short-term (referring to the next day) power generation operation of a cascade hydropower system is more complex than a single reservoir but important, due to the compensation effect between upstream and downstream reservoirs within a cascade. In this paper, we propose a short-term cascade hydropower stations optimal operation model based on conditional value-at-risk (called the CVaR-SCHOM model) to guide the actual power generation using uncertain streamflow forecast. We first analyze the uncertainty of short-term streamflow forecasts and establish the conditional probability function to describe the uncertainty of the forecasted streamflow sequence. We next propose the short-term operation target of the cascade hydropower station at the greatest expected benefit. We then introduce the conditional value-at-risk theory to analyze the risk of power shortage in different operating schemes under a certain level of confidence. Finally, based on the risk attitude of the decision-makers, we balance the benefit and risk of cascade hydropower stations operation and establish the CVaR-SCHOM model. We verify the model using the Jinguan cascade hydropower stations in the Yalung River basin. The main contributions are as follows. 1) By using k-means clustering to classify the forecasted streamflow sequence into different magnitudes and then using the joint probability function of the relative errors, an accurate description of the uncertainty of the short-term streamflow forecast can be achieved. 2) The internal characteristics of each cascade power station and the interrelationships between the cascade hydropower stations are complicated, and the power deviation and forecast error can show positive or negative correlations. 3) Compared with the traditional deterministic optimization model, the CVaR-SCHOM proposed in this paper performs well in real-world applications. The proposed model yields different degrees of improvement of the benefits and risks for various forecast magnitudes. The decisionmakers can choose different schemes according to their risk attitudes.

TI Examining individual recession events instead of a data cloud: Using a
   modified interpretation of dQ/dt-Q streamflow recession in glaciated
   watersheds to better inform models of low flow
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Low flows; Streamflow recession; Boussinesq; Equation
ID CATCHMENT; SCALE; FEATURES; RATES
AB To examine stream recession rates, hydrologists have plotted the rate of change in discharge (dQ/dt) versus the mean discharge (Q). Such plots typically result in a large cloud of data points where the slope of the lower bound of the cloud is often used to infer aquifer hydraulic properties as informed by certain interpretations of the Boussinesq Equation. For seven watersheds in New York State, USA ranging from 100 km(2) to 6415 km2, we distinguish data points in the dQ/dt-Q plot belonging to individual recession events instead of looking at the entire data cloud. The recession curve of individual events consistently shifts upward during the summer and late fall (relative to spring and late fall curves) and much of the scatter in the data cloud appears to be due to seasonal variations in recession. We speculate that these seasonal variations in recession rate may be due to variations in watershed evapotranspiration (ET). Additionally, most individual recession events have slopes of approximately two when plotted as log dQ/dt versus logQ. Application of the Boussinesq Equation to watershed-scale recession date predicts slopes shifting from 3 to 3/2 as recession progresses, thus the observed slope of two casts doubt on whether it is appropriate to apply hydraulic aquifer theory to these types of watersheds to infer aquifer properties or predict low flows. As a further validation of the hydrologic information content of individual recession curves, the individual recession curves from time periods with minimal ET (early spring and late fall) were used to establish storage-discharge functions for two of the smaller watersheds. With these storage-discharge functions, a simple hydrologic model could reasonably simulate time series with minimal calibration (Nash-Sutcliffe R-2 of 0.71 and 0.67 on log transformed discharge). Overall, this paper suggests that the analysis of individual event recession curves (particularly when compared among watersheds and seasons) can be a valuable tool for gaining insights into hydrological processes at the scale of large watersheds and can justify alternatives to current low flow models.

ID DISTRIBUTIONS
AB A six-stage operation policy for routing of flood hydrographs of return periods from 1.01 year up to the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) for any dam having a gated spillway is proposed. The gate opening rules are determined depending on the recent pool level. Regardless of the size and timing of any incoming floods, the fixed rules of the six-stage operation policy will provide optimum routing for all, which are classified into six different groups based on their return periods. 10-, 100-, 1000-, 10 000- 100 000-year floods, and PMF are the upper limits for the six groups. Next, an Incremental Dynamic Programming programme is developed to optimize both the firm and secondary energies of hydroelectric generation at monthly periods. First, the six-stage flood routing programme is applied sequentially to three dams, all on the Seyhan River in Turkey, for 18 combinations resulting from different active storages, and optimum flood operation policies for all three dams for all Is combinations are determined. Second, the Dynamic Programming programme is applied to these three darns, and optimum hydroelectricity generation policies for an 18 combinations are computed. Finally, the optimum active and flood retention storages for the three darns are determined so as to maximize the net probability-weighted present worth of hydroelectricity benefits minus flood damage costs.

AB Evapotranspiration is an essential process of ecosystem water consumption and is controlled by meteorological factors and soil water conditions. In this study, evapotranspiration based on soil water budget was investigated with respect to major influencing factors during the growing seasons of 2012-2015 for two adjacent forest communities in the semiarid Loess Plateau region: a natural secondary forest dominated by oak (Quercus liao-tungensis) and a plantation of exotic black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Based on the combination of precipi-tation, soil water storage, and evapotranspiration dynamics, four distinct periods were differentiated to explore the evapotranspiration response to the main meteorological factors. The correlation matrixes showed that, in most investigated days, evapotranspiration was limited by soil water storage, while an increase in soil water storage shifted dominance from water-related to energy-related factors. The stepwise regression of >= 5-day dry events in each period had a better fitness when paired with the relationship between the summations of evapotranspiration and dominant factors (R2 > 0.7, p < 0.01 for all) than the stepwise results for daily averages. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to validate the division and determine thresholds. All divisions were thoroughly validated, and the soil water storage thresholds of the black locust (120.2 mm and 150.7 mm) were higher than those of the oak (105.8 mm and 137.9 mm). Our results suggest that the oak had an adaptive water consumption strategy, while the black locust had a higher sensitivity to soil water insufficiency. The method for determining the threshold of soil water storage to separate the dominant factors of evapo-transpiration was validated. The approach may be applied to other semiarid forest communities with distinct evapotranspiration response patterns.

   convolutional-cycle generative adversarial neural network
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Inverse estimation; Generative adversarial neural network; Direct
   approach; Heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity
ID IDENTIFICATION
AB This study proposes a novel deep convolutional-cycle generative adversarial neural network (DC-CGAN) for estimating the hydraulic conductivity field K from the observed head field H. The estimation of the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity is apparently a high-dimensional inverse problem. Although the indirect approach is popularly utilized to solve the inverse problem, when compared with the indirect approach, the direct approach can conduct the inversion task faster without any iteration process. The key of the direct approach is to establish the inverse operator which maps the observed head to hydraulic conductivity. However, the complex inverse mapping relationship and high-dimensional estimation have always challenged the direct approach. Owing to the potential ability to handle high-dimensional images, six residual blocks with convolutional kernels have been designed as the generators of DC-CGAN to capture the potential distribution for enhancing the generation of estimation images similar to the real hydraulic conductivity. However, the traditional adversarial pattern of one-way generator and discriminator might suffer from the equifinality from different parameters. Therefore, to alleviate the equifinality, a cycle adversarial training pattern involving two generators and discriminators has been employed to supervise the map. Particularly, this pattern performs a forward map from H to K and then the reconstructed K back to H. The reconstruction process has been a supervision to the forward map process. A hypothetical case with 40 x 30 unknown K values has been designed to evaluate the performance of DC-CGAN, and the results indicate that DC-CGAN has achieved a desired generalization accuracy of MRE of 9.25 % and SSIM of 0.85 with the swift running speed of 0.2 s, which outperforms indirect approach. The application of the proposed DC-CGAN shows that it can provide a reliable and fast high-dimensional estimation task for the heterogenous hydraulic conductivity.

AB The Taihang Mountain Region (TMR) of China is an important headwater area that provides substantial water resources supporting the social and ecological stability of the North China Plain. Currently, groundwater resources in the TMR are rapidly declining, but the degree of groundwater storage (GWS) depletion and the driving mechanism of groundwater drought remain poorly understood. This study combined the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets to thoroughly analyze GWS changes in the TMR and the dominant driving factors during 2003-2016. In addition, a new index-the groundwater drought potential index (GDPI)-was established to quantify the potential of groundwater drought. We found that GRACE-derived terrestrial water storage in the TMR experienced a significant reduction (-21.82 mm/yr, p < 0.01) during 2003-2016, with a similar reduction in GWS (-21.22 mm/yr, p < 0.01). Human-induced impacts exerted a decisive role in GWS decreases in this region, with a relative contribution rate of 96% compared to the climatic contribution (4%). Climatic impacts on GWS were primarily observed in the southeastern TMR, where climate change appeared to be unbeneficial to groundwater recovery and exacerbated local groundwater depletion. Specifically, the groundwater drought potential was entirely increasing, indicating a worsened climate condition that precipitation increasingly failed to fill the groundwater deficit. Actions should be taken urgently to address the local groundwater crisis and to maintain water security. Our proposed GDPI not only reflected the degree of groundwater depletion but also revealed the relationship between groundwater drought and precipitation, making the index capable of being applied in drought forecasting. This study delivers a new perspective to better understand the mechanisms of GWS change and groundwater drought, and the results are expected to provide a valuable reference for groundwater management and water sustainability goals.

AB Water processes in the Tienshan Mountains have undergone great changes under the impacts of climate warming and human activities. Here, based on the Budyko framework, we investigated the respective contributions of climate change and human activities to decadal runoff changes (1982-2014) in two contrary watersheds, i.e., the humid Kashi watershed in the Yili River valley and the arid Boertala watershed in the Ebinur Lake basin, in the Tienshan Mountains, where closing the water balance is difficult due to the scarcity of precipitation gauges. To achieve closure of the decadal water balance of the study watersheds, we estimated evapotranspiration from a complementary relationship model and snow/ice melt using the degree-day method with the remote sensing snow cover product. We found that the increase of rainfall (+61.6 mm) and snow/ice melt (+57.3 mm) dominated the increase of runoff (+87.2 mm, from 398.2 mm in 1982-1992 to 485.4 mm in 1993-2014) in the Kashi watershed, contributing 47.1 mm (54.8%) and 43.8 mm (51.0%), respectively, to the increase of runoff. Unlike the Kashi watershed, human activities contributed -13.8 mm (-103.7%) to the runoff (+13.9 mm, from 61.4 mm in 1982-1997 to 75.3 mm in 1998-2014) in the Boertala watershed. Most of the increase in rainfall (+62.5 mm) and snow/ice melt (+13.6 mm) was consumed by the increase of ET (+64.0 mm) instead of runoff. Further analysis showed that most of the increases in snow/ice melt and ET were contributed from the high (>2500 m) and low (<1500 m) elevation regions, respectively. Snowmelt showed a decreasing trend in low elevation regions. Our study highlighted the importance of snow/ice melt and ET in understanding decadal changes in runoff in the Tienshan Mountains.

AB Rivers are the main source of molybdenum (Mo) to the oceans, and estuaries represent an important interface between rivers and oceans within which Mo can be sequestered or isotopically fractionated. Determining the behavior of Mo in estuaries is thus essential for a full understanding of the global Mo cycle. Here, we present a case study of the modern Yangtze Estuary and adjacent East China Sea shelf, generating Mo concentration and isotopic data for both aqueous and solid phases (i.e., suspended particulate matter, or SPM, primarily consisting of clay minerals and Al-Fe-Mn-oxides). Aqueous Mo concentrations increase rapidly from similar to 13.9 nM (river water) to similar to 115 nM (seawater) through the mixing zone of the innermost continental shelf. Minor deviations from a salinity-based mixing relationship (positive at < 22 psu to negative at 22-34 psu) indicate a shift from net desorption to net adsorption of Mo on SPM with increasing salinity. Aqueous delta Mo-98 values increase rapidly within the mixing zone from +1.15 parts per thousand (river water) to +2.3 parts per thousand (seawater), whereas the delta Mo-98 of SPM exhibits a smaller increase in the oceanward direction (from -0.25 to +0.27 parts per thousand). Aqueous delta Mo-98 exhibits large negative deviations from a simple two-component (i.e., freshwater-seawater) mixing model due to operation of an additional process, inferred to be Mo exchange between the fluid and solid phases. Simulations using a reaction-transport model (PHREEQC) demonstrated that a combination of two processes (i.e., freshwater-seawater mixing, and fluid-solid Mo exchange) can account for observed patterns of Mo concentrations and isotopes in the Yangtze Estuary. The results of this study thus provide valuable insights into Mo cycling in estuarine systems and indispensable quantitative data for global Mo budgets.

AB Understanding the combined and separate effects of climate and land use change on the water cycle is necessary to mitigate negative impacts. However, existing methodologies typically divide data into discrete (before and after) periods, implicitly representing climate and land use as step changes when in reality these changes are often gradual. Here, we introduce a new regression-based methodological framework designed to separate climate and land use effects on any hydrological flux of interest continuously through time, and estimate uncertainty in the contribution of these two drivers. We present two applications in the Yahara River Watershed (Wisconsin, USA) demonstrating how our approach can be used to understand synergistic or antagonistic relationships between land use and climate in either the past or the future: (1) historical streamflow, baseflow, and quickflow in an urbanizing subwatershed; and (2) simulated future evapotranspiration, drainage, and direct runoff from a suite of contrasting climate and land use scenarios for the entire watershed. In the historical analysis, we show that 60% of recent streamflow changes can be attributed to climate, with approximately equal contributions from quickflow and baseflow. However, our continuous method reveals that baseflow is significantly increasing through time, primarily due to land use change and potentially influenced by long-term increases in groundwater storage. In the simulation of future changes, we show that all components of the future water balance will respond more strongly to changes in climate than land use, with the largest potential land use effects on drainage. These results indicate that diverse land use change trajectories may counteract each other while the effects of climate are more homogeneous at watershed scales. Therefore, management opportunities to counteract climate change effects will likely be more effective at smaller spatial scales, where land use trajectories are unidirectional.

AB Previous studies have shown that the majority of the lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) started to expand rapidly since the late 1990s. However, the causes are still not well known. For Nam Co, being a closed lake with no outflow, evaporation (E-L) over the lake surface is the only way water may leave the lake. Therefore, quantifying E-L is key for investigating the mechanism of lake expansion in the TP. E-L can be quantified by Penman- and/or bulk-transfer-type models, requiring only net radiation, temperature, humidity and wind speed for inputs. However, interpolation of wind speed data may be laden with great uncertainty due to extremely sparse ground meteorological observations, the highly heterogeneous landscape and lake-land breeze effects. Here, evaporation of Nam Co Lake was investigated within the 19792012 period at a monthly time-scale using the complementary relationship lake evaporation (CRLE) model which does not require wind speed data. Validations by in-situ observations of E601B pan evaporation rates at the shore of Nam Co Lake as well as measured E-L over an adjacent small lake using eddy covariance technique suggest that CRLE is capable of simulating E-L well since it implicitly considers wind effects on evaporation via its vapor transfer coefficient. The multi-year average of annual evaporation of Nam Co Lake is 635 mm. From 1979 to 2012, annual evaporation of Nam Co Lake expressed a very slight decreasing trend. However, a more significant decrease in E-L occurred during 1998-2008 at a rate of 12 mm yr(-1). Based on water-level readings, this significant decrease in lake evaporation. was found to be responsible for approximately 4% of the reported rapid water level increase and areal expansion of Nam Co Lake during the same period.

ID SINGULAR-SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; FLUCTUATIONS
AB In recent times, significant areas of the Northeastern Argentine (NEA) have been affected by climatic fluctuations which have caused serious damages in ecosystems and people's livehoods, both by floods and droughts. This has mainly occurred in the Santa Fe Province, having a great impact on the underlying unconfined aquifer. This paper analyzes the relationships between meteorological variability and water table levels in the context of climate variability and climatic change in the lower Carcarana river experimental basin (about 4700 km(2)), located in the Santa Fe Province. The goal of the study is to obtain long-term (interannual) predictions of water table levels in the region. The methodology used responds to a hypothetical conception of the temporal series having a signal formed by random components with characteristics of white noise. Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA), among other non-parametric techniques were used to identify fluctuations and trend changes in climatic time-series. These characteristics provide valuable information for the evaluation of climatic evolution and for the detection of variations in this evolution, suggesting a climatic change either by natural mechanisms or by anthropogenic impacts. A positive trend in precipitation is found throughout the studied region with water table levels showing a similar spatial-temporal behavior. The SSA gives significant periodicities between 3 and 8 years showing a possible link between El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and precipitation and water table levels. The periodicities linked with ENSO are always present and the structures of the series are similar for the different studied periods. The results obtained, even if they are experimental constitute a first approximation. In general, they are promising, since the generated basis will enable to face further and more complex stages.

AB Water security plays an important role in socio-economic development, ecosystem management, and environmental sustainability. Over the last four decades, water security assessment has attracted much political and economic attention. An improved understanding of the relationships between water demand and supply is needed to mitigate the impacts of diminishing water resources. This study provides an overview of water security assessment by focusing on the various water security indicators and the concept of water footprint (blue, green, and grey water). The water security indicators based on the water footprint concept is currently receiving more attention because it accounts for the return flow from the total water withdrawn from a watershed. We also investigate the application of different physically-based hydrological models, such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC), on water security assessment at a regional to continental scale. However, hydrological/agricultural system models cannot quantify evapotranspiration from irrigation and rainwater separately. Therefore, independent quantification of blue and green water footprint from an irrigated field is challenging. For illustration purposes, we apply the fully distributed Agricultural Ecosystems Services (AgES) model in the Big Dry Creek Watershed (BDCW), an intensively managed and irrigated watershed located in semiarid Colorado. The results indicate that the blue water footprint is higher than the green water footprint in the watershed. In addition, the spatial distribution of grey water footprint is highly correlated with the amount of fertilizer application. The variation of grey water footprint among the irrigated fields is higher than blue and green water footprints. We conclude that applying a physically distributed model can provide useful insight into the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on water security at different scales.

AB A better understanding of sediment dynamics and variability may provide helpful insights for improving the efficiency of community-based monitoring strategies, enhancing sediment yield estimation, and optimizing soil conservation practices. However, this issue is rarely studied in karst areas, which are experiencing severe soil erosion, and sediment concentrations and load are highly variable. The objectives of this study were to characterize the daily suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and sediment load (SL) variability, and to test whether the watershed scale and lithology exerted substantial influence on this variability in 40 karst watersheds (420-3.4 x 10(5) km(2)) in southwest China. Several indicators of variability were used for daily SSC and SL including standard deviation, coefficient of deviation, inhomogeneity coefficient, the percentage of annual SL exported in 2% of the time (Ms-2%), and the percentage of time necessary to transport 50% of the annual SL (Ts-50%). Results indicated that the daily SSC and SL had high temporal variability, and the SL demonstrated stronger variability than the SSC. On average, half of the annual sediment load was discharged in<2.3% of the time in the period 2009-2012, implying that a few erosive events dominated the annual sediment load. The temporal variability of daily SSC and SL were scale dependent, and a larger watershed generally had a lower temporal variability. The Ms-2% and Ts-50% were relatively stable when the area of the watershed was greater than 0.15 million km 2 . However, no significant relationship was detected between karst coverage and Ms-2% or Ts-50% since karst coverage might not completely represent the characteristics of the 3-D hydrogeological structure in karst regions. The results from this study can help improve river flow management and control soil loss in karst watersheds.

TI Real-time bias adjustment for satellite-based precipitation estimates

AB An improved cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based approach to reduce the systematic biases of multi-satellite precipitation estimates in real time is proposed and verified over Mainland China. Efforts are primarily focused on establishing the bias-adjusting model by adopting the CDF based on a Self-adaptive Moving Window (CSMW), which systematically integrates the China Gauge-based Daily Precipitation Analysis (CGDPA) into the real-time TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA-RT). In our modelling experiments, the first 9-yr (2008-2016) precipitation data pairs were used to calibrate the CSMW model and establish a satellite-gauge relationship, which was then applied to the last 3 years of 2017-2019 as validation. Assessment results during the independent validation period show that the CSMW approach can significantly reduce the systematic positive bias of original TMPA-RT precipitation estimates in that the relative bias (RB) during the validation period decreases from 16.01% before adjustments to 0.29%, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) also has a dramatic drop of 13%. The error component analysis indicates that the substantial improvement is mainly manifested in the hit events (observed rain was correctly detected by satellite) but it failed to reduce the miss bias (observed rain was not detected by satellite). This arises because a majority of missed precipitation is drizzle and falls below the rain/no-rain discriminant threshold, which is normally excluded from the CSMW algorithm. Additionally, the CSMW approach seems to have significantly improved the TMPA-RT estimates at the mediumhigh rain rates (>8 mm/day), but it also has a limitation in enhancing the correlation coefficient between satellite retrievals and ground observations. The major advantage of this approach is its applicability when real-time gauge data are not available, which could further facilitate the expansion of satellite-based precipitation estimates for real-time natural hazards forecasting.

AB The soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) is one of the main soil chemical properties, which is required in various fields such as environmental and agricultural engineering as well as soil science. In situ measurement of CEC is time consuming and costly. Hence, numerous studies have used traditional regression-based techniques to estimate CEC from more easily measurable soil parameters (e.g., soil texture, organic matter (OM), and pH). However, these models may not be able to adequately capture the complex and highly nonlinear relationship between CEC and its influential soil variables. In this study, Genetic Expression Programming (GEP) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) were employed to estimate CEC from more readily measurable soil physical and chemical variables (e.g., OM, clay, and pH) by developing functional relations. The GEP- and MARS-based functional relations were tested at two field sites in Iran. Results showed that GEP and MARS can provide reliable estimates of CEC. Also, it was found that the MARS model (with root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.318 Cmol(+) kg(-1) and correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.864) generated slightly better results than the GEP model (with RMSE of 0.270 Cmol(+) kg(-1) and R-2 of 0.807). The performance of GEP and MARS models was compared with two existing approaches, namely artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR). The comparison indicated that MARS and GEP outperformed the MLP model, but they did not perform as good as ANN. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the most and the least influential variables affecting CEC. It was found that OM and pH have the most and least significant effect on CEC, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The structure and hydrodynamic properties of geological discontinuities and of a deeply weathered granite aquifer near these structures are described on the basis of geological, geophysical and hydrodynamic investigations in two sites of South India located along a 20-40-m-wide quartz reef intruding a weathered Archean biotite granite. One of the two sites also comprises a metre-wide dolerite dyke.
   Weathering processes appear to be at the origin of fissures development and of a related enhanced local hydraulic conductivity, both in the quartz reef and in the surrounding granite. The weathering profile in the granite (saprolite and fissured layer) is characterized by an abrupt deepening of the weathered layers in the granite near the contact and in the quartz reef itself. Therefore, the weathering profile shows a 'U'-shape geometry with, among others, the verticalization of the granite's fissured layer. The hydraulic conductivity of this verticalized layer is on average 5 x 10(-6) m/s and storativity about 10(-3) (-). The hydraulic conductivity of the fissured quartz is 4-6 x 10(-6) m/s and its storativity about 3-5 x 10(-4) (-). Both media are also characterized by a matrix hydraulic conductivity (10(-7)-10(-9) m/s) and by a significant heterogeneity in hydrodynamic properties that generates preferential flow paths along the sub-vertical fissures parallel to the reef axis. A special attention has been paid for characterizing this heterogeneity.
   The weathering of the dolerite dyke, however, results in a local low hydraulic conductivity, which consequently does not enhance either the thickness of weathered granite layers or its hydraulic conductivity.
   The obtained results complete the conceptual hydrogeological model developed for weathered granite aquifers in characterizing the relationships between weathering processes and hydrodynamic properties near geological discontinuities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogeological resources in regional, large-scale groundwater systems are conditioned by their specific geological setting, which defines their capacity to supply human demand and their potential to recover from human-induced stress factors such as water withdrawal. In this paper, the hydrogeology of a range-and-basin hydrogeological system is described, based on potentiometric, hydrochemical and isotopic data, in order to fulfill a twofold objective: to characterize the alteration brought about in the hydrogeological system by intensive groundwater withdrawal, where tectonic elements such as fault zones play a significant role in the flow behaviour, and to define groundwater hydrodynamics under current human pressures as a necessary step to achieve appropriate groundwater management. Hydraulic head data indicate the relationships between geological formations in the range areas and the sedimentary infill of the basin. In this set-up, fault zones and a fracture network have a direct effect on the recharge, and allow upward vertical flow from the basement to the sedimentary aquifers. Hydrochemical and isotopic data support this observation. The use of fluoride and nitrate as tracers for the contribution of deep and shallow flow systems provides a detailed portrait of the effects of pumping on the flow path distribution. Isotopic data depict seasonal trends in the water captured by wells. In this connection, we can differentiate between two distinct flow systems: a regional, large-scale, longer residence time system, originating in the surrounding ranges, and a local flow system constituted by infiltration in the lower areas of the basin. The two systems, with specific water qualities, contribute differently to the resources that are withdrawn, and their specific contributions, in the frame of the basin water budget, determine the potential for present sustainable water exploitation.

ID RADAR RAINFALL; NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL; SELECTION; SYSTEM
AB Rainfall nowcasting supports emergency decision-making in hydrological, agricultural, and economical sectors. However, short-term prediction is challenging because meteorological variables are strongly interconnected and rapidly change during an event. Since machine learning do not require any previous physical assumption, this study investigates their ability to provide reliable and quick forecasts. This paper proposes a machine learning model for probabilistic rainfall nowcasting at 10 min intervals for short lead times -from 30 min up to 6 h. The model employs cumulative rainfall fields from station data as inputs for a feed forward neural network to predict rainfall interval and the corresponding probability of occurrence. Cumulative rainfall depths from station data were used to overcome the lack of temporal memory of the feed forward neural networks. In this way, using only the current rain field as input, the model exploited pattern recognition techniques combining both temporal -cumulative rainfall depth -and spatial -cumulative rainfall field - information. Based on 359 rain events observed in an area of 1619 km2 in Southern Italy, 95 machine learning models were independently trained for 19 recording stations and for each target lead-time (30, 60, 120, 180 and 360 min). Comprehensive nowcasts verification was performed to analyse the reliability of probabilistic nowcasts using both continuous (RMSE and RAE) and categorical (POD, FAR and CSI) indicators. The performance of the models was also compared with the results of Eulerian Persistence. All the models produced consistent nowcasts and learnt the complex relationship describing space-time rainfall evolution. As expected, predictive accuracy gradually decreased as the lead-time increase, according to physically based models. Results showed that the use of both temporal and spatial in-formation enables the model to predict short-term rainfall using only the current measurements as input, resulting in a rapid, easily replicable and convenient nowcasting approach. The procedure is an effective way to predict multi-step rainfall fields and is suitable for operational early warning system.

AB Ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) is an effective indicator of ecosystem functioning, which is widely used to characterize the coupling relationship between terrestrial carbon and the water cycle. Although the linear trends in WUE have been well reported, the nonlinearity of the secular trends in WUE and their relative contribution to the overall changes were still poorly investigated. In this study, we used ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to extract the secular trends of the WUE and their relative contribution (RC) to the WUE changes in China, which represents the stability of the ecosystem functioning. We found that although increasing trends dominated the secular trends of the WUE, nearly half of the study areas had experienced trend shifts. Except that deciduous forests and mixed forests were dominated by trend shifts, most of the land cover types were dominated by increasing trends. The RC exhibited a bimodal pattern along the elevation gradient, with peaks at 20 m and 5000 m. Similarly, the RC peaked at the east and south aspects, and was the lowest for the west and north as-pects. In comparison, the RC exhibited a U-shaped pattern with the slope, and was the lowest at 80 degrees. For the monotonically increasing trends and decreasing-to-increasing trends, the high RC mainly occurred on the North China Plain and Loess Plateau, indicating ecosystem improvement and strong stability. Meanwhile, it was low in northeastern China and southwestern China, indicating unsustainable ecosystem improvement. The RC was al-ways very low for increasing-to-decreasing trends and monotonically decreasing trends, indicating low ecosystem stability with a high possibility for improvement. Temperature and the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration were the two main climatic factors driving the WUE changes. The climatic mean state rather than the climatic variability affected the ecosystem stability. The results of this study highlight the relative contribution of the secular trends to WUE changes and provide a better understanding of the structure and the stability of ecosystem functioning.

AB The increase in dynamic interactions between climate and human activities threatens water security in terms of water quantity and quality. Most water security studies have focused on water quantity compared to water quality, while both are equally important and vital for maintaining a healthy ecosystem and human well-being. The first part of the paper provides a review of the potential impacts of climate-related extreme events (i.e., drought, flood, and wildfires) on different water quality indicators and the potential impact of cascading extreme events (e.g., drought-flood regimes) on dynamics of water quality behavior. In the second part of the paper, we demonstrate the cascading impact of severe drought and an extreme historical flood event (October 1-4, 2015) in South Carolina (USA) on water quality variables. The effect of drought on water quality in contrasting land-use settings is investigated. Finally, water quality data was collected over a period of time in three types of land-use settings to study the dynamics of multiple flood and drought events on microbial communities. Flooding conditions result in high levels of bacteria associated with fecal contamination, especially in the stream setting, where large differences between drought and flooding occur in the microbial communities. The results highlight the significant impact of cascading events on water quality and microbial communities. The effect of drought on water quality indicators in different land-use settings can be different, highlighting the dominant role of watershed characteristics. Overall, it is essential to develop quantitative frameworks in the context of sustainability science to quantify the interaction between climate, watershed, and anthropogenic variables that control stream water quality. This study highlights the importance of understanding the relationships between extreme events and water quality indicators as an important step to improve ecosystem health and sustainability. Finally, some remarks are made on the knowledge gaps which need to be addressed in future studies.

AB The study of unsaturated behavior of soils pivots around the relationship between soil suction and the amount of water content present in the soil mass, which is termed as soil-water retention curve (SWRC). The drying SWRC is generally determined by neglecting the volume change behavior of the soil for low plastic soils. Such a procedure is bound by an inherent assumption that the soil exhibit zero or negligible volume change and can lead to approximations in important SWRC parameters, including saturated volumetric water content, residual water content, and fitting parameters, which are essential for the estimation of unsaturated hydraulic characteristics of the soil. This study deals with the determination of SWRC parameters for a range of soils starting from non-plastic to high plastic soils, with and without considering volume change characteristics. For this purpose, the SWRC of six different natural soils were experimentally measured using a miniature tensiometer (T5) and a dew point potentiometer (WP4C), while the VSC of the used soils were measured using the balloon method. Efforts were made to critically understand the influence of no volume change assumption on the SWRC parameters, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function, and flow of water through 1D soil column. The experimental results indicated that the no volume change assumption underpredicted the water retention curves of low plastic soils, and this error in SWRC increases with the soil plasticity. The measured VSC of the used soils further revealed that there could be a range of saturated volumetric water content (VWC) depending on the initial state of the soil sample, which also influences the sensitivity of the SWRC parameters. Therefore, the present study proposed a new methodology to determine unambiguous SWRC (in terms of VWC-suction) for a particular soil type combining both the measured VSC data and SWRC data. Based on the obtained results, it was recommended that the details of VSC must be incorporated along with the measured SWRC data for soils having plasticity and clay content higher than 15 and 11%, respectively.

AB Due to shortage of flow monitoring data in ungauged semidiurnal river, 'environmental flow' (EF) determination based on its key component 'minimum low flow' is always difficult. For EF assessment this study selected a reach immediately after the Halda-Karnafuli confluence, a unique breeding ground for Indian Carp fishes of Bangladesh. As part of an ungauged tidal river, EF threshold establishment faces challenges in changing ecological paradigms with periodic change of tides and hydrologic alterations. This study describes a novel approach through modeling framework comprising hydrological, hydrodynamic and habitat simulation model. The EF establishment was conceptualized according to the hydrologic process of an ungauged semi-diurnal tidal regime in four steps. Initially, a hydrologic model coupled with a hydrodynamic model to simulate flow considering land use changes effect on streamfiow, seepage loss of channel, friction dominated tidal decay as well as lack of long term flow characteristics. Secondly, to define hydraulic habitat feature, a statistical analysis on derived flow data was performed to identify 'habitat suitability'. Thirdly, to observe the ecological habitat behavior based on the identified hydrologic alteration, hydraulic habitat features were investigated. Finally, based on the combined habitat suitability index flow alteration and ecological response relationship was established. Then, the obtained EF provides a set of low flow indices of desired regime and thus the obtained discharge against maximum Weighted Usable Area (WUA) was defined as EF threshold for the selected reach. A suitable EF regime condition was obtained within flow range 25-30.1 m(3)/s i.e., around 10-12% of the mean annual runoff of 245 m(3)/s and these findings are within researchers' recommendation of minimum flow requirement. Additionally it was observed that tidal characteristics are dominant process in semi-diurnal regime. However, during the study period (2010-2015) the validated model with those reported observations can provide guidance for the decision support system (DSS) to maintain EF range in an ungauged tidal river.

AB In this paper the periodic patterns of the isotopic composition of precipitation (delta O-18) for 22 stations located around Central Europe are investigated through sinusoidal models and wavelet analysis over a 23 years period (1980/01-2002/12). The seasonal distribution of delta O-18 follows the temporal variability of air temperature providing seasonal amplitudes ranging from 0.94 parts per thousand to 4.47 parts per thousand; the monthly isotopic maximum is observed in July. The isotopic amplitude reflects the geographical dependencies of the isotopic composition of precipitation providing higher values when moving inland. In order to describe the dominant oscillation modes included in delta O-18 time series, the Monet Continuous WaVelet Transform is evaluated. The main periodicity is represented at 12-months (annual periodicity) where the wavelet power is mainly concentrated. Stations (i.e. Cuxhaven, Trier, etc.) with limited seasonal isotopic effect provide sparse wavelet power areas at the annual periodicity mode explaining the fact that precipitation has a complex isotopic fingerprint that cannot be examined solely by the seasonality effect. Since temperature is the main contributor of the isotopic variability in mid-latitudes, the isotope temperature effect is also investigated. The isotope temperature slope ranges from 0.11 parts per thousand/degrees C to 0.47 parts per thousand/degrees C with steeper values observed at the southernmost stations of the study area. Bivariate wavelet analysis is applied in order to determine the correlation and the slope of the delta O-18 - temperature relationship over the time frequency plane. High coherencies are detected at the annual periodicity mode. The time frequency slope is calculated at the annual periodicity mode ranging from 0.45 parts per thousand/degrees C to 0.83 parts per thousand/degrees C with higher values at stations that show a more distinguishable seasonal isotopic behavior. Generally the slope fluctuates around a mean value but in certain cases (sites with low seasonal effect) abrupt slope changes are derived and the slope becomes strongly unstable.

AB Many density-dependent groundwater flow simulations rely on a linear equation of state that relates the fluid density to the total dissolved solute content (TDS). This approach ignores non-linear volume of mixing effects, as well as the impact of any chemical reactions. These effects can be considered by using geochemical codes that implement algorithms that calculate the density of a fluid based on the concentration of individual solute species. While in principle such algorithms could be used in-lieu of a linear equation of state in a groundwater model, the computational overhead is such that the use of a more simplified equation of state is preferred. This requires that the assumption of linearity as well as the appropriate value of the linear slope have to be determined. Here, published density measurements of 7 chemically-distinct salt lake brines are compared with densities calculated by PHREEQC-3, confirming the applicability of PHREEQC's algorithm to salt lake brines, as well as to seawater brines and artificial brines from laboratory experiments. Further, calculations with PHREEQC-3 are used to assess the impact of mineral precipitation reactions during evaporative concentration. Results show that the density-TDS relationship is essentially linear over a wide concentration range, and that slopes range between 0.64 and 0.75, with the upper end of the range applying to Na-CO3-Cl brines and the lower end to Na-Cl brines. Mineral precipitation of highly-soluble evaporate minerals such as halite and trona limit TDS, and may lead to considerable errors in coupled flow simulations based on a linear equation of state at high concentrations. Misrepresentation of the slope may lead to an error of up to 20% in the calculated length of the brine nose bordering a salt lake, or of the Rayleigh number, which indicates if a density stratification is stable or not.

AB S-sulfide, Fe content and heavy Fe isotopic signatures of the bulk core sediments all indicate anoxic and sulfidic conditions in the hyporheic zone. The relationship between S-sulfide and Fe contents suggests that Fe(III) oxides/hydroxides are transferred between non-sulfidic Fe(II) minerals and Fe(II)-sulfides under anoxic and sulfidic conditions, respectively. The Fe isotope composition provides further evidence that microbial dissimilatory reduction of Fe(III) and the formation of Fe(II)-sulfides and non-sulfidic Fe(II) minerals are the dominant Fe geochemical pathways and take place at different depths in the hyporheic zone. In the upper sections of the Core A and B (with depth less than approximate to 10 m), microbial Fe(III) reduction and non-sulfidic Fe(II) minerals formation govern the Fe cycling and the Fe isotope composition in hyporheic water and bulk sediments. Microbial Fe(III) and SO42- reduction and interaction between produced Fe(II)aq and Fe(II)-sulfides precipitate control delta Fe-56 values of sediments and water sample in the midsections (approximate to 13-19 m) of the Core A. Conversely, abiotic Fe(III) reduction by HS- determines the bulk delta Fe-56 values of core sediments and water in the midsections (approximate to 13-19 m) of the Core B. Microbial S(31,reduction is limited and microbial Fe(III) reduction controls the delta Fe-56 values of water and sediments at the bottom of both cores. The variation of delta Fe-56 values and the As concentration in hyporheic water are similar at each depth, indicating that As enrichment in the water is strongly associated with the microbial reduction of Fe(III) oxides/hydroxides and the formation of Fe(II)-sulfides and non-sulfidic Fe(II) minerals. The enriched-delta Fe-56 values of high As water concentrations suggest that microbial reduction of Fe(III) oxides/hydroxides is the dominant process that promotes As mobility in the hyporheic zones.

AB A severe wildfire burnt over 1 million ha of forested land in southeastern Australia in early 2003. Included in the burnt area were two 136 and 244 ha hydrologic research catchments in the East Kiewa valley that had been decommissioned following a 10 year study, and an adjacent larger (10,050 ha) gauged catchment, the West Kiewa River. The three catchments were re-instrumented to measure discharge and suspended sediment fluxes at 15 min time-steps, with additional measurement of bedload at the East Kiewa sites. Analysis of annual rainfall-discharge relationships and of flow duration curves for the first 2 post-fire water years indicated annual flow increases of around 65-75% for Slippery Rock Creek in both post-fire water years and 40% and 76-94% for Springs Creek in 2003-2004,and 2004-2005, respectively. The flow impacts on the less severely burnt West Kiewa River were far more subdued, and did not exceed pre-fire variability in annual flows. Flow duration curve analysis did not indicate changed runoff generating processes at the daily timescale, with the curves shifting upward uniformly over the flow regime. Total sediment exports increased by factors of 8-9 (up to 2.96 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) from the East Kiewa catchments in year 1 after the fire, diminishing to a 24-fold increase in year 2. Flow increases accounted for much of the year 2 exports as suspended sediment concentrations decreased toward pre-fire levels. Post-fire suspended load exports from the larger West Kiewa catchment were much lower per unit area, probably reflecting the smaller area of high intensity burn, less intensive burning of riparian areas and possible scale effects. The results were observed under near-average rainfall conditions, with the exception of one short duration high intensity storm that produced almost 50% of the combined sediment loads from the East Kiewa catchments.

AB This study proposes a characterization of the temporal relations between soil moisture and precipitation at a very short time-scale, i.e. from 1 h to 2 weeks. The analysis is based on seven soil moisture time series from time domain transmission (TDT) probes positioned along a 90-m transect, and monitored at a 20-min rate in the shallow soil layer (5-25 cm), and on precipitation observed every 15 min. Wavelet analysis is proposed for the characterization of the temporal relationships between soil moisture and precipitation. The normalized local wavelet spectrum of soil moisture reveals power features related to the precipitation events in the short scales, and residing in the long scales. The variance activity depicted in the wavelet power spectra of precipitation and soil moisture is organized in preferential bands of wavelet scales: 1-48 h, 48 h to 1 week, and 1-2 weeks. For the 1-48 h scale, soil moisture is linked to precipitation occurrence, intensity and duration, while for the 48 h to 1 week scale soil moisture relates to the periodicity of the rainfall events, and for the 1-2 weeks scale to the duration of the dry spells. Additionally, a distance-time wavelet analysis was conducted to simultaneously assess spatial and temporal variabilities for each of the three predefined bands. The spatial analysis showed many similarities between series along the transect that were attributable to soil homogeneity. The averaging of the variance showed that 93% of the concentration of the precipitation variance was at the 1-48 h scale, while most of the soil moisture variation (85%) was accounted for at the 48 h to 2 weeks scale. Disparity between the short duration of precipitation system and the extension of the soil moistening process is due to the transfer of energy from precipitation to soil moistening.

AB The complicated phenomenon induced by inadequate precipitation is a drought that impacts water resources and human life. Traditional methods to assess groundwater drought events are hindered due to sparse groundwater observations on a spatio-temporal scale. These groundwater drought events are not well studied in the study area of the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) holistically. This study applied four machine learning models to the training datasets of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) and Groundwater Storage (GWS) data to improve resolution to 0.25 degrees from 1 degrees. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model outperformed the four models and results showed Pearson correlation (R) (0.99), Nash Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) (0.99), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (5.22 mm), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (2.75 mm). The GRACE Groundwater Drought Index (GGDI) was calculated by normalizing XGBoost-downscaled GWS. The trend characteristics, the temporal evolution, and spatial distribution of GGDI were analyzed across the IBIS from 2003 to 2016. The wavelet coherence approach was used to evaluate the relationship between teleconnection factors and GGDI. The XGBoost downscaling model can accurately reproduce local groundwater behavior, with the acceptable correlation of coefficient values for validation (ranging from 0.02 to 0.84). The accumulated Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with the time of 1, 3, and 6 months, and selfcalibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI) were used to validate GGDI. The findings have demonstrated that GGDI has comparable drought patterns to SPEI-3 and SPEI-6 and sc-PDSI. The teleconnection factors have a significant impact on the GGDI shown by the wavelet coherence technique. The impact of the sea surface temperature index (namely, NINO3.4) on GGDI was observed significantly high among other teleconnection factors in the IBIS. The proposed framework can serve as a useful tool for drought monitoring and a better understanding of extreme hydroclimatic conditions in the IBIS and other similar climatic regions.

AB Quantification of groundwater recharge is one of the most important issues in hydrogeology, especially in view of the ongoing changes in climate and land use. In this study, we use numerical models of 1D vertical flow in the vadose zone and the water table fluctuation (WTF) analysis to investigate local-scale recharge of a shallow sandy aquifer in the Brda outwash plain in northern Poland. We show that these two methods can be jointly used to improve confidence in recharge estimation. A set of preliminary numerical simulations based on soil water content measurements from 4 grassland and pine forest profiles provided a wide range of recharge estimates (263 mm to 839 mm for a 3-year period). Additional simulations were performed with the lower boundary condition specified as a functional relationship between the groundwater table elevation and the rate of groundwater outflow from the vertical profile (horizontal drains boundary condition). In this way, we could reproduce the water table fluctuations resulting from recharge and lateral discharge to nearby lakes. The agreement between simulated and observed groundwater levels differed depending on the specific set of parameters characterizing vadose zone flow, which allowed us to find the most representative parameter sets and refine the range of plausible recharge estimates (501 mm to 573 mm per 3 years). The recharge rates from WTF (410 mm to 606 mm per 3 years) were in good agreement with numerical simulations, providing that the effect of the natural recession of groundwater table due to lateral outflow was considered (master recession curve method). Our results show that: (i) the proposed approach combining 1D vadose zone modeling and WTF improves recharge estimation, (ii) multiple types of observations, including groundwater table positions, are needed to calibrate and validate vadose zone flow models, and (iii) extended periods of observations and simulations are necessary to capture year-to-year variability in the recharge rates.

AB Targeting nonpoint source (NPS) pollution hot spots is of vital importance for placement of best management practices (BMPs). Although physically-based watershed models have been widely used to estimate nutrient emissions, connections between nutrient abatement and compliance of water quality standards have been rarely considered in NPS hotspot ranking, which may lead to ineffective decision-making. It's critical to develop a strategy to identify priority management areas (PMAs) based on water quality response to nutrient load mitigation. A water quality constrained PMA identification framework was thereby proposed in this study, based on the simulation-optimization approach with ideal load reduction (ILR-SO). It integrates the physically-based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an optimization model under constraints of site-specific water quality standards. To our knowledge, it was the first effort to identify PMAs with simulation-based optimization. The SWAT model was established to simulate temporal and spatial nutrient loading and evaluate effectiveness of pollution mitigation. A metamodel was trained to establish a quantitative relationship between sources and water quality. Ranking of priority areas is based on required nutrient load reduction in each sub-watershed targeting to satisfy water quality standards in waterbodies, which was calculated with genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed approach was used for identification of PMAs on the basis of diffuse total phosphorus (TP) in Lake Dianchi Watershed, one of the three most eutrophic large lakes in China. The modeling results demonstrated that 85% of diffuse TP came from 30% of the watershed area. Compared with the two conventional targeting strategies based on overland nutrient loss and instream nutrient loading, the ILR-SO model identified distinct PMAs and narrowed down the coverage of management areas. This study addressed the urgent need to incorporate water quality response into PMA identification and showed that the ILR-SO approach is effective to guide watershed management for aquatic ecosystem restoration.

AB Streamflow is an essential component of the hydrologic cycle in the regional and global scale and the main source of fresh water supply. It is highly associated with natural disasters, such as droughts and floods. Therefore, accurate streamflow forecasting is essential. Forecasting streamflow in general and monthly streamflow in particular is a complex process that cannot be handled by data-driven models (DDMs) only and requires pre-processing. Wavelet transformation is a pre-processing technique; however, application of continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) produces many scales that cause deterioration in the performance of any DDM because of the high number of redundant variables. This study proposes multigene genetic programming (MGGP) as a selection tool. After the CWT analysis, it selects important scales to be imposed into the artificial neural network (ANN). A basin located in the southeast of Turkey is selected as case study to prove the forecasting ability of the proposed model. One month ahead downstream flow is used as output, and downstream flow, upstream, rainfall, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration with associated lags are used as inputs. Before modeling, wavelet coherence transformation (WCT) analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between variables in the time-frequency domain. Several combinations were developed to investigate the effect of the variables on streamflow forecasting. The results indicated a high localized correlation between the streamflow and other variables, especially the upstream. In the models of the standalone layout where the data were entered to ANN and MGGP without CWT, the performance is found poor. In the best-scale layout, where the best scale of the CWT identified as the highest correlated scale is chosen and enters to ANN and MGGP, the performance increased slightly. Using the proposed model, the performance improved dramatically particularly in forecasting the peak values because of the inclusion of several scales in which seasonality and irregularity can be captured. Using hydrological and meteorological variables also improved the ability to forecast the streamflow.

AB More than 750 groundwater samples collected from different hydrological zones of Punjab state in India were analysed for selenium and some quality parameters to determine suitability of groundwater for irrigation and drinking purpose. Selenium content varied from 0.01 to 35.6 mu g L-1. Average Se content in groundwater was the highest in Northeastern Siwalik foothill zone (NSFZ) followed by Central zone (CZ) and Southwestern zone (SWZ). Majority of the water samples contained <10 mu g Se L-1 - the safe limit for drinking purpose except one location each in SWZ and CZ and three locations in NSFZ. Only at one location, water contained >20 mu g Se L-1 which is considered unsuitable for irrigation of crops. On the basis of pH, 42% of the samples were unfit for drinking in SWZ, 41% in CZ and 6% in NSFZ. Only in SWZ, 24% of the samples with high total dissolved salts were unfit for drinking and 18% unfit for irrigation purpose due to high EC. Selenium content in groundwater was inversely related to depth of water and the degree of relationship was higher for NSFZ (r = -0.342**) followed by CZ (r = -0.157*) and SWZ (r = -0.126*). Depending on the amount of water consumed from 2 to 5 L, average Se intake varied from 1.66 to 6.39 mu g d(-1) and its contribution towards the recommended daily Se allowance ranged from 3.0% to 11.6% for women and 2.4% to 9.1% for men. Among the grain samples, 94% of wheat and 46% of rice contained Se above the deficiency limit of 100 mu g kg(-1). Thus, the residents in the study area primarily consuming wheat grains and drinking groundwater are getting adequate supply of Se. Among the materials tested for decreasing Se from drinking waters, scrap iron fillings showed potential for commercial use. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urban rainfall runoff has been a topic of increasing importance over the past years, a result of both the increase in impervious land area arising from constant urban growth and the effects of climate change on urban drainage. The main goal of the present study is to assess and analyze the correlations between rainfall variables and common indicators of urban water quality, namely event mean concentrations (EMCs) and event fluxes (EFs), in order to identify and explain the impacts of each of the main rainfall variables on the generation process of urban pollutants during wet periods. To perform this analysis, runoff from eight summer rainfall events that resulted in combined sewer overflow (CSO) was sampled simultaneously from two distinct catchment areas in order to quantify discharges at the respective outfalls. Pearson statistical analysis of total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand at 5 days (CBOD5), total phosphorus (Prot) and total kedjal nitrogen (N-TKN) showed significant correlations (rho = 0.05) between dry antecedent time (DAT) and EMCs on one hand, and between total rainfall (TR) and the volume discharged (VD) during EFs, on the other. These results show that individual rainfall variables strongly affect either EMCs or EFs and are good predictors to consider when selecting variables for statistical modeling of urban runoff quality. The results also show that in a combined sewer network, there is a linear relationship between TSS event fluxes and COD, CBOD5, P-tot, and N-TKN event fluxes; this explains 97% of the variability of these pollutants which adsorb onto TSS during wet weather, which therefore act as tracers. Consequently, the technological solution selected for TSS removal will also lead to a reduction of these pollutants. Given the huge volumes involved, urban runoffs contribute substantially to pollutant levels in receiving water bodies, a situation which, in a climate change context, may get much worse as a result of more frequent, shorter, but more intense rainfall events.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation models can be broadly classified as statistical or physical process based models. However, assuming the limitation of individual approaches, the integration of these two approaches has become a challenging task for ET simulation under varying surface and climatic conditions. To address this issue, a revised Penman-Monteith (PM) formula that uses a non-linear exponential Clausius-Clapeyron relationship was proposed in this study. The improved PM formula was further coupled into the loss function of the deep learning (DL) model, and subsequently, a hybrid DL model was formulated. The hybrid DL model with improved physical conceptualization considered the constraints of surface energy balance and turbulent diffusion processes in the ET simulation. The performance of the hybrid DL model was verified at 212 flux sites from the FLUXNET that contain ten types of underlying surfaces across the globe. The results revealed that as compared to the original DL model, the hybrid DL model improved the predictive capability of ET. The average root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) reduced by 12.1 W/m(2) and 5.7%, respectively for latent heat flux (LE) simulation. Furthermore, the hybrid DL model also performed better than the original DL model in predicting the extreme events (such as ET under drought and heatwave conditions) which justifying its improved generalization capability. Sensitivity analysis outcomes showed that the vegetation parameters highest influence for ET simulations at the 212 flux sites, followed by soil parameters and meteorological parameters. The hybrid DL model was further applied to map the inter-seasonal distribution of global ET across twelve months of the year 2015 with five global ET products as the benchmark. Certainly, this research achieved the seamless integration of machine learning-based ET model and physical mechanism-based ET model and provided a new dimension for ET simulation. The hybrid DL model could be adopted to generate continuous ET datasets across regional and global scales.

AB Climate change-driven retreat of glaciers is producing thousands of glacial lakes across mountain regions. These lakes generally grow, coalesce into larger lakes that may produce increased downstream hazards and risks due to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). This study assesses such hazards of Lower Barun Lake located near Mount Everest, Nepal. We model a series of scenarios, including two potential avalanches that enter the lake from the surrounding slope and eight potential GLOFs from the lake. To evaluate the susceptibility of the frontal moraine to overtopping, we characterize the initial avalanche-induced surge of water over the moraine caused by the kinetic energy of arriving masses and possible tsunami-like events. Further, we present physical hydrodynamic models that reveal the hazard from the potential overtopping and GLOF events along the Barun-Arun river valley. Special attention is given to analyze the flow hydraulics at six downstream settlements. To estimate potential impacts at each location, two extreme-magnitude, two high-magnitude, two moderate-magnitude, and two low-magnitude GLOFs were hydraulically evaluated for the present lake dimension and the modeled future growth of the lake. As with most hydrological processes, the magnitude and frequency of GLOFs from Lower Barun Lake have an inverse, albeit uncertain, relationship, but the potential impacts on people and infrastructure are extremely sensitive to the events' magnitude. The flow dynamics results indicate that an overtopping flood without erosion of the damming moraine causes minimal impact in the valley. The extreme-magnitude and high-magnitude GLOF cases, where the moraine is incised, have a larger impact but differ greatly in magnitude at each of the downstream settlements. The moderate-magnitude and low-magnitude GLOFs, while the most frequent type, have limited volume and peak discharge, causing less impact downstream. Our calculations only portray the part of the hydrograph representing lake overfill due to a volume of ice or rock entering the lake, and the volume of the lake that could drain from a breach of the damming moraine down to specified depths over specified time periods.

AB Springs are the natural discharge points of groundwater. They are of considerable value for drinking water supply and some springs are of historical and tourism value. However, increasing industrial and urban expansion has led to serious problems of overdraft of groundwater resources, which in turn had caused the disappearance of springs globally. Thus, the protection of springs while at the same time allowing for the use of local groundwater resources is an important task of water resources management. In this study, we propose a new multi-objective simulation and optimization (S/O) model to find an optimal extraction strategy which balances the competitive relationship between spring outflow and groundwater extraction. In the newly developed model, the extraction rates of different groundwater wells are taken as the decision variables, and maximization of groundwater extraction and maximization of spring outflow are taken as the two objective functions. Baotu Spring which is located in northern China has been famous since the Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE). However, Baotu Spring has been drying up since the 1990s due to over extraction of the local groundwater. Thus, we take Baotu Spring as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed model. Simultaneously, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), the multi-objective fast harmony search algorithm (MOFHS) which is coupled with the commonly used groundwater flow code MODFLOW, is adopted to search the Pareto optimal solutions (the optimal extraction strategies). The optimization results of Baotu Spring field during the management period from July 2013 to June 2014 show that more groundwater resources could be extracted without threatening the sustainable outflow of Baotu Spring and Black Tiger Spring. The optimization results for different hydrological years show that climate variability (mainly in precipitation) is an important factor when choosing the optimal extraction strategy. The optimization results of Baotu Spring in northern China show that the newly developed model is a promising tool to find the optimal groundwater extraction strategies which can protect springs while maximizing the extraction of groundwater resources in a spring field.

AB Lake water storage is an important factor in analyses of lake water balance. However, it is difficult to calculate the water storage of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau due to the lack of bathymetric data. Lake water storage and changes in Chibuzhang Co (CC) and Duoersuodong Co (DC), which are located in an endorheic system and have been connected since 2006, were estimated based on in situ bathymetric data, satellite altimetry data and Landsat images of the central Tibetan Plateau. In 2016, the maximum depth and water storage of DC were 68.7 m and 12.2 +/- 1.72 km(3), respectively, with an area of 490.2 km(2), and those of CC were 116.3 m and 16.2 +/- 2.27 km(3), respectively, with an area of 575.4 km(2). The total lake water storage in DC and CC increased by 24.5% (2.4 km(3)) and 14.1% (2 km(3)) from 2003 to 2014, respectively, based on satellite altimetry data and Landsat images using an empirical equation. The relationship between lake changes and meteorological factors indicated that both increased glacial meltwater and increased precipitation were important drivers of each lake's expansion and that a small increase in evaporation (2.5 mm/y) had little negative impact on lake expansion (0.41 m/y). Heterogeneous changes in the two lakes from 1993 to 2005 were mainly due to water from CC supplying DC through a channel, and the lake level of DC was always lower than that of CC until 2006, indicating that the geological conditions around both lakes were also an important factor in the lake changes. The assumption was that all glacial meltwater from the Puruogangri and Geladandong glaciers was supplied to the two lakes through runoff with minimal evaporation, and glacial meltwater made an approximately 19.3 +/- 4.5% contribution to the lake expansions (0.4 km(3)/y) of DC and CC from 2003 to 2014 based on the results of the glacier mass balance.

AB Despite the importance of groundwater recharge (GR), its accurate estimation still remains one of the most challenging tasks in the field of hydrology. In this study, with the help of inverse modeling, long-term (6 years) soil moisture data at 34 sites from the Automated Weather Data Network (AWDN) were used to estimate the spatial distribution of GR across Nebraska, USA, where significant spatial variability exists in soil properties and precipitation (P). To ensure the generality of this study and its potential broad applications, data from public domains and literature were used to parameterize the standard Hydrus-1D model. Although observed soil moisture differed significantly across the AWDN sites mainly due to the variations in P and soil properties, the simulations were able to capture the dynamics of observed soil moisture under different climatic and soil conditions. The inferred mean annual GR from the calibrated models varied over three orders of magnitude across the study area. To assess the uncertainties of the approach, estimates of GR and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from the calibrated models were compared to the GR and ETa obtained from other techniques in the study area (e.g., remote sensing, tracers, and regional water balance). Comparison clearly demonstrated the feasibility of inverse modeling and large-scale (>10(4) km(2)) soil moisture monitoring networks for estimating GR. In addition, the model results were used to further examine the impacts of climate and soil on GR. The data showed that both P and soil properties had significant impacts on GR in the study area with coarser soils generating higher GR; however, different relationships between GR and P emerged at the AWDN sites, defined by local climatic and soil conditions. In general, positive correlations existed between annual GR and P for the sites with coarser-textured soils or under wetter climatic conditions. With the rapidly expanding soil moisture monitoring networks around the globe, this study may have important applications in aiding water resources management in different regions.

AB The water-sediment regulation of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir is conducted to control the relationship between riverine runoff and sediment transport of the Yellow River; however, there is no research about the effect of water-sediment regulation on the bioavailability and fluxes of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs). In this study, water and suspended sediment (SPS) samples were collected downstream of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir before, during, and after the water-sediment regulation in 2013. The 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations of freely dissolved, total dissolved, and SPS-associated were determined. During water regulation, water discharged from the reservoir at a high flow rate led to the resuspension of downstream sediment. During sediment regulation, the sediment ejected from the reservoir resulted in higher SPS concentrations than that during water regulation. Both the freely and total dissolved PAH concentrations in river water during sediment regulation were the highest, followed by the concentrations during water regulation and before regulation. The freely dissolved PAH concentrations in river water during the water sediment regulation were 2-11 times higher than those before water-sediment regulation. This was due to the fact that the resuspended sediment during water-sediment regulation could release PAHs into water phase, and more contaminants were released from the SPS during sediment regulation than during water regulation. The fluxes of sediment and the 16 priority PAHs (Sigma(16)PAHs) during water-sediment regulation contributed to 32.4% and 35.7% of their annual fluxes, respectively, which were higher than the contribution (22.6%) of water discharge. This study suggested that the water-sediment regulation might reduce the long-term retention of sediment and PAHs in the reservoir. However, the environmental risk of PAHs as well as other contaminants downstream of the reservoir and in the estuary might increase during that period. Therefore, the effect of water-sediment regulation on the bioavailability and environmental risk of HOCs should be considered in the operation and management of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir in the future.

TI Climate change impact on glacier and snow melt and runoff in Tamakoshi
   basin in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Climate change; Runoff; Snow cover; Snowmelt; Tamakoshi basin
AB Glacier and snow covered area play an important role in the hydrology of glacierized basin. Climate change is likely to change the snow cover area and alter the water availability in future making long term water management more challenging. This study is aimed at predicting future changes in climatic parameters of the Tamakoshi basin of Nepal, estimating changes in snow covered area for changed climate, and subsequently quantifying temporal change in the runoff from the basin. Remote sensing is extensively used to determine the extent of snow covered area in the basin. Future climate of the basin is predicted by statistical downscaling outputs from two GCMs (HADCM3 for SRES A2 and B2 and CGCM3 for SRES A2 and A1B scenarios). Results show that temperature and precipitation will both increase in future under these scenarios. The relationship between the snow covered area with temperature and precipitation is developed from the observed data, and is used to predict snow covered area for future where it was found that spring and winter snow covers are more vulnerable to climate change. A temperature index based snowmelt runoff model is used to simulate basin runoff from the year 2000 to 2059. The analysis during observed period (2000-2009) shows that about 18% of the annual runoff in the basin is contributed by snow and ice melting. Snowmelt is largest during summer with an average melt of about 230 mm, which is about 17% of total water produced for runoff during this season. In terms of percentage contribution, snowmelt is found more significant during spring season where the average snowmelt is about 44 mm, which is about 25% of total water produced for runoff during the season. Along with snowmelt, basin runoff is also expected to increase in future at the rate of 5.6 mm/year. Findings of this study will serve as a reference for further studies and planning of future water management strategies in the Tamakoshi basin. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological changes can lead to biodiversity responses that are complex and challenging to quantify. We present a framework that uses biodiversity as a criterion to address "where to buy" and "how much to buy" in a payment-for-environmental-services (PES) program focused on water storage service in the Everglades basin, USA. The PES program was designed to pay for added water storage on private cattle ranchlands by raising the spillage level in drainage control structures to reduce surface flows. We predicted that increased hydration of previously drained wetlands would benefit biodiversity, a previously unquantified but desirable co-benefit of the original program, and that a PES program offering bundled services (e.g., storage and biodiversity) can better achieve restoration goals. We quantified desirable biodiversity services (abundance of native flora and fauna such as cover of wetland and forage plants, and abundance of fishes, amphibians, and macroinvertebrates), disservices (e.g., abundance of invasive plants and mosquitos), and hydrologic signatures (e.g., wetland water depth, inundation area and duration) at four ranches to develop eco-hydrological relationships (models) between hydrological changes and biodiversity responses. Next, a hydrologic model (MIKE-SHE/MIKE-11) was used to predict surface and subsurface water levels and flows and resulting wetland hydrologic signatures for 13 water storage alternatives on the ranches, which were used as example PES proposals. A decision-support-system (DSS) was developed to integrate (i) storage predicted by the hydrologic model, (ii) biodiversity responses predicted by eco-hydrologic models, and (iii) a user-defined preference scheme to assign importance weights to storage, biodiversity, and implementation cost. The DSS calculated a cumulative score for ranking PES proposals. By considering desirable services and dis-services, stakeholders can decide on their preferred level of services, e.g., buyer(s) may settle for less storage if there is a gain in desirable biodiversity. The DSS can identify trade-offs among services, helping stakeholders negotiate.

AB The isotopic equilibrium state between precipitation and low-level water vapor is a common assumption in numerous paleoclimate and atmospheric studies based on water stable isotopes. However, the paucity of field observations limits the validation of this assumption. This study examines the isotopic equilibrium state from event-based precipitation and daily near-surface water vapor samples collected during the onset and the termination of the 2005-2006 wet season in the Bolivian Andes (Zongo valley, 16 degrees 09'S, 68 degrees 07'W). Our observations show that the observed isotopic composition of precipitation (delta D-p) deviates from the theoretical isotopic composition of precipitation at equilibrium with water vapor (delta D-p_eq). Disequilibriums (Delta D-p_eq = delta D-p - delta D-p_eq) are mostly negative (73%), indicating that precipitation is more depleted than a condensate that would have been formed from surface water vapor, and half of them are between 10 and + 10%. They are significantly correlated to delta D-p (r(2) = 0.30, n = 70, p < 0.001) suggesting that controls on delta D-p also impact Delta D-p_eq. Although equilibrium state does not prevail at the individual rain event scale, a strong relationship is observed between delta D-p and delta D-p_eq over the whole period of field samplings (r(2) = 0.86, n = 70, p < 0.001). The review of possible causes to explain the disequilibriums shows that below-cloud rain evaporation and diffusive exchanges are little involved. Other local processes such as rain type, condensation conditions and surface water recycling appear as better candidates to explain Delta D-p_eq. Lastly, we explore how local processes affect delta D-p. We show that large-scale dynamic along air masses history is dominant (nearly 80%) to explain delta D-p whereas local effects are dominant to explain deuterium excess in precipitation. In consequence, we conclude that delta D-p is a correct candidate to examine and to reconstruct large-scale atmospheric processes from past to present time scales.

AB The macroscopic effects of soil textural heterogeneity and fine-scale soil layering on unsaturated flow remain poorly understood. In this study we used the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to numerically generate artificial particle packings of heterogeneous sands from which the pore structure can be extracted. Packings were generated from known grain size distributions following sand grain mixing and fine-scale profile layering. Five sands with different mean grain sizes were used to investigate the effects of heterogeneity on their pore structure, including changes in the permeability and soil water retention (SWR). Heterogeneous media were created by mixing a relatively fine sand with coarser sands. In addition, we created layered media having sharp as well as transitional interfaces between the two sand samples. Mixing fine and coarse sand caused reductions in the average pore body and pore throat sizes of the coarser sands, and hence also in their intrinsic permeability. The layered media with a transitional interface showed lower porosities at the interface because of penetration of small particles into the larger pores, while the porosities increased at sharp interfaces. The nonlinear relationships between permeability and the average pore body and throat radii were explored using different unimodal sands. Mixing fine and coarse sand caused a decrease in the capillary pressure at a given water content of the new medium, and hence larger values of the van Genuchten a parameter. The SWRCs of the layered soils with a sharp interface were best described using bimodal functions. Sharp interfaces caused a non-monotonic change in the drainage curve due to discrepancies between the pore throat radii of the two adjacent sands. This change was influenced by d(50) of the sands used for the layered media. In contrast to the sharp interface, a monotonic (smooth) change in the drainage curve was observed for two sands having small differences in their d(50) values. The study gave considerable insight into how particle heterogeneity and layering affects the hydraulic properties of unsaturated media.

AB Simulations of flood inundation have important practical significance for flood control and disaster alleviation. Accuracy and efficiency are two major indicators in evaluating the performance of flood inundation models. Although a flood inundation model based on hydrodynamics can use detailed topographic data to accurately evaluate flood inundation processes, it is difficult to build a reasonable model for complex topography and variable flood conditions. More importantly, the simulation time for these types of models is generally too long and cannot be accomplished in real time. This paper proposes a new method, named the flood-connected domain calculation (FCDC) method, to improve the efficiency of flood inundation models in regions of complex topography. The main concept of the method is that inundation can only occur in areas where the water level is higher than the terrain elevation and connected with the river; this requires the key development of an algorithm to search for connected domains. The FCDC method uses a topographic triangle network to define the DEM source data and topological relationships are constructed to undertake the flood-connected domain search. Two cases from the Songhua River in Harbin City, China have been examined to expand the usage and effect of the method. The results show that the FCDC method can simulate source flooding such as inundation by river flooding or dike breach flooding and can characterize inundation under a range of conditions. Also, it can use a range of resolutions for topographic data and water level as model input, which in turn significantly reduces simulation time while providing reasonable simulation results. In addition, the FCDC method can be used to obtain a smooth display effect for flood inundation processes. Overall, the FCDC method is useful for estimating flood inundation and preparing for emergencies because of its time-efficient performance and low input and hardware requirements.

AB Hurricanes and other intense storms have previously been reported to cause short-term changes in surface water quality. We examined the water quality of the East Pearl River in southern Mississippi both before and after Hurricane Katrina caused extensive damage to the watershed in 2005. Our post-storm sampling began two months after the hurricane, and thus we missed any immediate short-term consequences. However, sampling over the following two years allowed us to examine whether damage to the watershed resulted in significant longer-term effects on water quality. Interpretation of the time series data is complicated by the natural seasonal and climatic variability of the system. Thus, we utilized chemical property-property plots as well as semi-empirical relationships to compare pre- and post-storm water quality. Our analysis suggests that hurricane-induced vegetative destruction within this river basin has not substantially changed the concentrations of DOC, POC, SPM, pH, or dissolved Fe. However, ligninphenol analysis of colloidal organic matter did show some significant changes in carbon-normalized concentration as well as in some degradation and source parameters. Nonetheless, even these changes were small and likely temporary. This lack of change may be partly due to the slow degradation of woody materials that occurs only over a period of a few years, even in the sub-tropical climate of this region. Also, transport of DOC material from the land, through the soils, and into the river is not always instantaneous because DOC may stay in soils for a long time. Our work can be examined in the context of other research focused on hurricane effects on different time scales. For instance, shorter term hurricane influences, such as immediate flooding, can cause concurrent, short-lived water quality changes. Likewise, if increased hurricane activity (as might result from climate change) results in permanent landscape or ecosystem changes, then significant long-term water quality changes might be expected.

AB Exploring the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought and its potential influence factors is crucial for early warning of hydrological drought. As a case study in the Xijiang River Basin (XRB), South China, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) series from 1961 to 2013 were used to represent the meteorological drought and hydrological drought with daily runoff generated by VIC model. An identification process for the threshold and the mechanism of drought propagation was conducted based on rank order analysis and Copula theory. The drought propagation regulations of drought variables, geographical location, and lag-time were established by linear or non-linear functions. Eventually, the propagation regulations were applied to the hydrological drought prediction from 2021 to 2050. Results indicated that: (1) The spatial-temporal patterns of meteorological drought are the critical factors in triggering drought propagation, and the effects of meteorological drought area, drought severity, drought duration, drought spatial concentration, and drought persistent duration increase successively. The critical threshold for triggering drought propagation is the combined frequency of the above five drought variables greater than 0.14. (2) The geographic location, center number, duration, severity, and area of two drought types follow the linear, twopiecewise, power, linear and logarithmic functions, respectively. Drought mainly propagation from west to east in three-dimensional space, and the lag-time was less than three months, with the maximum being 78 days. Unlike triggering drought propagation, driving drought propagation is synthetically associated with meteorological, soil water, groundwater, and topography conditions. (3) Under the MRI-ESM2-0 model, the severity and area of hydrological drought under different scenarios in the 2021-2050 will increase compared with the reference period 1961-2013, and the extreme hydrological drought exceeding history may occur under scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5. The findings can help policy-makers manage the early stages of hydrological drought based on meteorological drought conditions and thus reduce the negative impact of drought hazards.

AB As a major weather-driven disaster, drought can be assessed from meteorological to hydrological aspects. Although the propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts has received lots of attention in recent years, the hazard transferability in such a propagation process has been less investigated. In this study, we propose a framework with the incorporation of copulas and a drought hazard propagation ratio (DHPR) to examine the drought propagation process, particularly to investigate the accompanying hazard transferability. Three catchments with few human activities located in two major river basins of China (i.e., the Yangtze River basin and the Yellow River basin) with different hydro-climatic conditions are selected as case studies. First, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the standardized runoff index (SRI) are calculated to measure meteorological and hydrological droughts for the 1961-2014 period. Subsequently, the drought duration and severity are identified using the theory of run, and then the most-likely scenarios and the corresponding uncertainty ellipse based on copulas are incorporated to appraise meteorological and hydrological drought hazards. Finally, a novel concept of DHPR is proposed to evaluate the hazard transferability from meteorological to hydrological drought. The results show that (1) the drought propagation generally shows lengthened duration, amplified severity, and the time-delay phenomenon among these catchments; (2) drought hazards represented by the most-likely scenarios of duration and severity and the uncertainty ellipse tend to ascend based on the bivariate frequency analysis; and (3) the hazard transferability is stable from meteorological to hydrological droughts, as indicated by the almost unchanged DHPR ranging between 1 and 2 for the most-likely scenarios and varying between 2 and 4 for the uncertainty ellipse under different return periods. The above results imply firm and robust correlations between meteorological and hydrological drought hazards, which can provide a supplement for revealing the drought propagation mechanism and would benefit drought risk assessment.

AB The effectiveness of stormwater management strategies is a key issue affecting decision making on urban water resources management, and so proper monitoring and analysis of pilot studies must be addressed before drawing conclusions. We performed a pilot study in the suburban Shepherd Creek watershed located in Cincinnati, Ohio to evaluate the practicality of voluntary incentives for stormwater quantity reduction on privately owned suburban properties. Stream discharge and precipitation were monitored 3 years before and after implementation of the stormwater management treatments. To implement stormwater control measures, we elicited the participation of citizen landowners with two successive reverse-auctions. Auctions were held in spring 2007, and 2008, resulting in the installation of 85 rain gardens and 174 rain barrels. We demonstrated an analytic process of increasing model flexibility to determine hydrologic effectiveness of stormwater management at the sub-catchment level. A significant albeit small proportion of total variance was explained by both the effects of study period (similar to 69%) and treatment-vs.-control (similar to 7%). Precipitation-discharge relationships were synthesized in estimated unit hydrographs, which were decomposed and components tested for influence of treatments. Analysis of unit hydrograph parameters showed a weakened correlation between precipitation and discharge, and support the output from the initial model that parcel-level green infrastructure added detention capacity to treatment basins. We conclude that retrofit management of stormwater runoff quantity with green infrastructure in a small suburban catchment can be successfully initiated with novel economic incentive programs, and that these measures can impart a small, but statistically significant decrease in otherwise uncontrolled runoff volume. Given consistent monitoring data and analysis, water resource managers can use our approach as a way to estimate actual effectiveness of stormwater runoff volume management, with potential benefits for management of both separated and combined sewer systems. We also discuss lessons-learned with regard to monitoring design for catchment-scale hydrologic studies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID STREAM-FLOW; LAND-COVER; RAINFALL; HYDROLOGY
AB Investigation was made on the hydrological extremes of the upper Blue Nile basin in Ethiopia through the use of high and low flow probability distributions and flow-duration-frequency (QDF) relations. The dependence of QDF predictions on the period used for the analysis was investigated considering the possibility that short historical records might cover periods with a cluster of wet/dry years or where there was a high/low climate oscillation. In such cases, the derived relationships might not be representative of the long term natural variability and might lead to significantly different (biased) predictions.
   The results show that the high and low flow extremes of the basin could be best described by exponential and Frechet distributions, respectively. The 1960s-1970s and the 1990s-2000s were identified as wet periods while the 1980s had more dry years. The constructed QDF curves using wet and dry periods reveal significant variations on their estimation specific to the sub-basins. For the entire upper Blue Nile basin, the wet/dry periods could be evaluated relative to the long term 1964-2009 data available at the downstream location, El Diem station. High flow QDF estimations using wet periods are in similar order of value with the long term QDF predictions. The exception is when data concentrates on the dry period (19805); then the QDF statistics are not representative. It was found that bias correction of around 15% in the flow quantiles is required to shift the QDF statistics to the long term values. The required shift could be fully explained by the climate oscillations. On the contrary, low flow QDFs show shifts that do not necessarily correspond to the changes observed in the climate; rather they are influenced by combined effect of changes in climatic variables and changes in land/water management practices. Since high flow extremes appear to have link with large scale atmospheric variables, it would be interesting to further investigate how the temporal changes in high flow statistics can be linked to the atmospheric variables.

The resulting data set was artificially decimated to mimic sampling frequencies from 12 h to monthly time interval. Monthly sampling interval resulted in significant errors in the estimated annual TP and SRP load of up to 35% and 28% respectively, and the resulting data sets were insufficient to observe peaks in P concentration in response to storm events. Weekly sampling reduced the maximum percentage errors in annual load estimate to 15.4% and 6.5%. TON and silicon concentrations were less variable with changing river flow, and monthly sampling was sufficient to predict annual load estimates to within 10%. However, to investigate within-river nutrient dynamics and behaviour, it is suggested that a weekly sampling interval would be the minimum frequency required for TON and Si studies, and daily sampling would be a minimum requirement to adequately investigate phosphorus dynamics. The loss in nutrient-concentration signal due to reduced sampling interval is presented. Hysteresis in the nutrient concentration/flow relationships for all 32 storm events during the study period were modelled and seasonal patterns discussed to infer nutrient sources and behaviour. The high-resolution monitoring in this study identified, for the first time, major peaks in phosphorus concentration in winter that coincide with sudden falls in air temperature, and was associated with biofilm breakdown, This study has shown that to understand complex catchment nutrient processes, accurately quantify nutrient exports from catchments, and observe changes in water quality as a result of nutrient mitigation efforts over time, it is vital that the newly emerging field-based automated sampler/analyzer technologies begin to be deployed, to allow for routine high-resolution monitoring of our rivers in the future.

AB The influence time of polluted sediments on water quality, as well as the influence degree, plays a key role in decision-making for sediment pollution control. However, factors that determine influence time, especially slow infiltration through sediments, are poorly known. Further, there is a lack of corresponding indexes and efficient models to accurately identify the critical moment in determining the influence time from the dynamic process of interaction between downward advection (infiltration) and upward diffusion at the sediment-water interface. Therefore, this article focuses on methods for determining the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water salinisation. An alternative expression of Peclet number (Pe = vertical bar uC/D partial derivative C/partial derivative x vertical bar(x=0)) is proposed to characterise the transient relative role of downward advection versus upward diffusion on the transport of non-reactive solutes; Pe = 1 can be used as an exact criterion for identifying the critical moment when saline sediments no longer affect the overlying water. We then developed a single-domain model that does not require an alternate run the two subdomains in solving processes, enabling to flexibly simulate sediment-water interactions, both effectively and efficiently. By combining this model with the alternative Pe, the influence time of saline sediments on reservoir water can be accurately determined. We used the planned Muguandao Coastal Reservoir, Qingdao, China, as an example to explore the effects of infiltration on the influence time. The influence time shortens with infiltration rates in a power function relationship and decreases from 970 years to 19.3 years in the rate range of (1-7) x10(-2) m/year. Furthermore, based on the simulation and sensitivity analysis, we suggest a simple formula (t = 5.25D/u(2)) to directly predict the influence time of saline sediments on water salinisation for shallow mixed coastal reservoirs. The importance of understanding slow infiltration in determining the influence time is discussed.

AB Tides are one of the main factors affecting coastal aquifers, and thus they are important in supporting material transport and carbon circulation. In coastal mangrove swamps, the groundwater responses to tidal variations become more complicated owing to the complex topography, soil types, and the interactions of groundwater with fauna and flora. Perhaps because of this, quantitative relationships between the groundwater dynamics and the tidal actions of coastal mangrove swamps remain unclear. There is still a lack of studies that consider the integrated tidal effects on subsurface aquifers of different soil zones and topographic types. From January to December 2018, we simultaneously monitored the fluctuations of the piezometric head and salinity at the active root zone (shallow zone) and the low-permeability silty zone (middle zone) in the riverine forest and fringe forest and on the mudflat of a coastal mangrove swamp. Tidal signals were extracted from high-resolution timeseries groundwater data using a Bayesian statistics modeling method-based code (Baytap08). Different time lags between tidal elevation fluctuations and the fluctuations of the piezometric head and salinity were detected. At the inland riverine forest and seaward mudflat, the upper aquifer quickly dried at low tides, whereas that of the fringe forest in between remained wet all the time. Although the groundwater fluctuations, especially the salinity fluctuations, were highly attenuated owing to capillary effects in the middle zone, the shallow zone showed high dependence on the tidal variations. Most previous studies have focused either on the macropore function (animal burrows and decayed roots) of mangrove swamps or on the capillary attenuation of coastal aquifers. Our results indicate that we need to consider both when analyzing the tidal responses of groundwater in mangrove swamps. The insights obtained from this study may help track the movement of water and materials in the coastal aquifers of mangrove swamps and provide references for better management of these valuable ecosystems and other similar coastal aquifers with complicated structures.

AB The flow and chemistry of groundwater in agricultural riparian zones are highly heterogeneous due to the human impacts as well as convergent flow conditions and variable stream-aquifer interactions. To evaluate impact of seasonal heavy pumping on the aquifers in agricultural riparian zones, we investigated groundwater and stream water using a multi-parameter approach integrating continuous monitoring of water level and temperature, and periodic measurements of hydrogeochemical parameters, water-stable isotopes, and microbial communities in agricultural riparian zones with contrasting patterns of land use and water use across the third order stream for two years in the mid-western South Korea. Intense groundwater use for warming of greenhouses in dry farmland during winter induced groundwater drawdown of up to 5 m, resulting in losing-stream condition and decreased groundwater temperature with considerable spatial variability. Groundwater contamination was clearly identified based on elevated concentrations of agriculture-derived solutes such as Ca2+ and SO42-, despite the negligible NO3- content under reducing conditions. Three-component mixing of groundwater based on delta O-18 and dissolved silica revealed major water sources of regional recharge, paddy soil water, and winter stream water, with considerable differences in their contributions between the riparian zones. The fraction of winter stream water in groundwater showed different temporal variability depending on aquifer connectivity with the stream as well as groundwater use. Principal component analysis of hydrogeochemical and isotopic parameters revealed the major processes of agricultural contamination, water-rock interactions, and the contribution of paddy-impounded water, which varied significantly with the extent of stream water infiltration. These results suggest that seasonal pumping substantially affect groundwater flow and its relationship to stream with considerable horizontal and vertical variability in riparian aquifers. This study highlights spatial and temporal variations of groundwater flow dynamics in riparian areas are effectively delineated by a multi-parameter approach, which can contribute to better understanding of stream-aquifer interactions and implementation of integrated water management in the areas with agricultural land uses and water uses.

AB Occurrence of temporal stability of soil water content has been observed for a range of soil and landscape conditions and is generally explained as a consequence of local and non-local controls. However, the underlying factors for this phenomenon are not completely understood and have not been quantified. This work attempts to elucidate and quantify the effects of several local controls, such as soil hydraulic properties and root water uptake, through water flow simulations. One-dimensional water flow was simulated with the HYDRUS code for bare and grassed sandy loam, loam and clay soils at different levels of variability in the saturated hydraulic conductivity K-sat. Soil water content at 0.05 and 0.60 m and the average water content of the top 1 m were analyzed. Temporal stability was characterized by calculating the mean relative differences of soil water content in 100 soil columns used for each combination of soil and season. Using log-normal distributions of K-sat resulted in mean relative differences distributions that were commonly observed in experimental studies of soil water content variability. Linear relationships were observed between scaling factor of In K-sat and spread of the mean relative differences distributions. For the same scaling factor and soil texture, simulated shapes of the mean relative differences distributions depended on the duration of the simulation period and the season. Variation in mean relative differences was higher in coarser textures than in finer ones and more variability was seen in the topsoil than in the subsoil. Root water uptake decreased the mean relative differences variability in the root zone and increased variability below it. This work presents a preliminary research to promote the use of water flow simulations under site-specific conditions to better understand the temporal stability of soil water contents. The estimation of the spatial variability of K-sat from soil water content monitoring presents an interesting avenue for further research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Long-term tracer data collected over an 8 year period were analyzed to explore the transit times of two small (similar to 1 km(2)), contrasting headwater catchments in the uplands of Scotland. At Loch Ard, the catchment was characterized by low permeability gleyed soils overlying metamorphic geology. At Sourhope, more freely draining podzolic soils were dominant, which mantled fractured and faulted volcanic rocks. Hydrometric data and chemically-based hydrograph separations indicated that Loch Ard was a flashy catchment dominated by runoff processes in the upper soil horizons. In contrast, around 77% of annual flow at Sourhope was sustained by well-buffered groundwater sources. Weekly Cl- time series in precipitation and stream flow revealed similar variability in inputs at both sites, but much greater damping in outputs at Sourhope. Despite this, both catchments filtered white noise frequencies in precipitation inputs into I If outputs. These input-output relationships were modeled with a range of transit time distributions (TTD). At the responsive Loch Ard catchment, mean transit times (MTT) for the study period were estimated at 135-202 days. Models based on a gamma distribution or two parallel linear reservoirs were best able to capture the short- and long-term fluctuations in stream water in response to input variations. At Sourhope, the highly damped tracer signal in stream waters was poorly captured by all the TTDs used. Resulting MTT estimates of 1830-1970 days are based on weak model fits and poorly identifiable parameter sets, indicating that natural tracers such as Cl- are inadequate for catchments where MTTs are greater than a few years. At both sites, estimates of MTT using moving windows over the 8 year data sets revealed sensitivity to precipitation amounts and the length of monitoring period. It is concluded that time series of around 4 years are required to adequately constrain MTT estimates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Millennium Drought lasted more than a decade and is notable for causing persistent shifts in the relationship between rainfall and runoff in many southeastern Australian catchments. Research to date has successfully characterised where and when shifts occurred and explored relationships with potential drivers, but a convincing physical explanation for observed changes in catchment behaviour is still lacking. Originating from a large multi-disciplinary workshop, this paper presents and evaluates a range of hypothesised process explanations of flow response to the Millennium Drought. The hypotheses consider climatic forcing, vegetation, soil moisture dynamics, groundwater, and anthropogenic influence. The hypotheses are assessed against evidence both temporally (e.g. why was the Millennium Drought different to previous droughts?) and spatially (e.g. why did rainfall-runoff relationships shift in some catchments but not in others?). Thus, the strength of this work is a large-scale assessment of hydrologic changes and potential drivers. Of 24 hypotheses, 3 are considered plausible, 10 are considered inconsistent with evidence, and 11 are in a category in between, whereby they are plausible yet with reservations (e.g. applicable in some catchments but not others). The results point to the unprecedented length of the drought as the primary climatic driver, paired with interrelated groundwater processes, including declines in groundwater storage, altered recharge associated with vadose zone expansion, and reduced connection between subsurface and surface water processes. Other causes include increased evaporative demand and harvesting of runoff by small private dams. Finally, we discuss the need for long-term field monitoring, particularly targeting internal catchment processes and subsurface dynamics. We recommend continued investment in the understanding of hydrological shifts, particularly given their relevance to water planning under climate variability and change.

AB Soil moisture is a crucial component of the forest ecosystem because it primarily controls vegetation growth. However, the potential for predicting the subsurface from the surface soil moisture through (de)coupling in boreal larch forest (Larix gmenilii) in China has rarely been investigated. In the present study, the regression and residual as well as cross-correlation analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between the surface (5 cm) and subsurface (10, 20, and 40 cm as well as the profile soil moisture) soil moisture in the Larix gmenilii forest. The applicability of the exponential filter (ExpF) and cumulative distribution function matching (CDF) methods for estimating the subsurface using the surface soil moisture in the study area and the impacts of (de)coupling on the simulation accuracy were assessed. Our results shown that the coupling between surface and subsurface soil moisture decreased with soil depth increasing and decoupling is dominant in the range varying between 0.11 and 0.22 cm(3)cm(-3). The CDF method exhibits superiority for estimating the subsurface soil moisture relative to the ExpF method in the study area. Furthermore, the surface soil moisture values in the coupling range capture the dynamics of the subsurface soil moisture, while decoupling significantly reduces the accuracy of simulating the subsurface soil moisture. Thus, we propose an approach involving the reconstruction of the coupling time series associated with the (de)coupling, which improves the accuracy of the subsurface soil moisture simulation, particularly at depth, where the coupling is weak. Thus, the (de)coupling effect should henceforth be incorporated in the future subsurface soil moisture simulation studies and is helpful to understand the hydrological process of soil, improve regional models and the associated parameters.

TI Factor affecting nitrate in a mixed land-use watershed of southern China

AB River nitrate (NO3-) pollution is ubiquitous and has attracted worldwide attention. The continuous increase nitrate flux in the river system is mainly caused by inputs of exogenous nitrate sources or nitrogen transformations. In this study, coupled nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate were used to identify sources and transformations of nitrate in a mixed land use watershed of southern China (the Beijiang River basin), aimed at evaluating the impacts of sources or transformations on nitrate pollution and provide guidance for aquatic environment management. The results showed that the NO3--N flux in the Beijiang River Basin was 9.37 x 104 tons in 2015; isotopic evidence indicated that the impacts of nitrogen transformations in the river on the removal and production of nitrate were not significant, and the increased NO3--N concentration along the river was caused by inputs of exogenous nitrate sources. The isotope-based source apportionment revealed that approximately 52% of the influx NO3--N was contributed by synthetic fertilizer, 27% by soil nitrogen and 21% by domestic sewage. There was no significant temporal variations in source apportionment; however, significant spatial variations were found across the study area. The spatial variations were mainly affected by the different land use patterns. With the increasing percentage of urbanized areas, the proportional contributions of domestic sewage have increased, which has resulted in an increased NO3--N concentration. In addition, the relationships between the land use index and proportional contributions of different nitrate sources suggested that the effect of urbanized area might be more pronounced on nitrate pollution in a mixed land use watershed. Therefore, the results of this study suggested that land use should be considered in nitrate pollution management strategies and reducing inputs of nitrate sources to river water is crucial to reducing nitrate pollution in mixed land use watersheds.

AB Water temperature is an important indicator of the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and influences numerous biological and chemical processes that affect water quality, the health and productivity of biota, and other ecosystem services. In this study, we improved the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to explicitly consider the thermal processes influencing the temperature of various terrestrial water components (i.e., surface runoff, lateral flow, and base flow) and the heat balance of water in streams. The improved SWAT model with an explicit heat balance description on both terrestrial and aquatic thermal processes (SWAT-HB) was compared with previous versions of the SWAT model that employ only empirical relationships between air temperature and stream temperature (SWAT-ER) or combine empirical terrestrial water temperature estimates with the heat balance of stream water (SWAT-EH) for the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and Greensboro Watershed (GW) in the United States. The results show that, even though the SWAT-HB better simulates terrestrial thermal processes, all three models produce comparable simulations of long-term stream temperatures, indicating that stream temperature is mainly influenced by air temperature as water travels along large rivers. Nevertheless, the SWAT-HB and SWAT-EH models achieved better performance than the SWAT-ER model in the winter and spring but exhibited mixed performance in the summer and fall. The better model performance of the SWAT-HB model than the SWAT-EH model can be attributed to the improved estimation of terrestrial water temperature components. Although, empirical methods (e.g., SWAT-ER) are suitable for providing estimation of stream temperature, the coupled terrestrial and aquatic heat balance-based methods (e.g., SWAT-HB) allow for the consideration of land and water management practices (e.g. crop irrigation, land use change, and water use for thermoelectric cooling) effects on stream temperature.

AB The hydraulic conductivity of soil is a fundamental parameter that should be obtained both in hydrological and geotechnical studies since it relates to a series of hazards in earthen engineering projects, whereas investigations on dispersive soils, especially those distributed in cold regions, have rarely been reported. This study aims to explore the characteristics of permeability by using a dispersive soil from northeastern China, as well as the effects of soil salinity and freeze-thaw on the variation in hydraulic conductivity. Indoor constant-head permeation tests were conducted on artificially prepared specimens, and initial soil suctions were measured by the filter paper method to assist the analyses. The results demonstrated that the hydraulic conductivity decayed with permeation time until reaching relative stability, and both maximum and relatively-stable values (k(max) and k(rs), respectively) should be adopted for comprehensively characterizing the permeability of dispersive soils. Increasing salt content increased the k(max) exponentially, and the inflection salt content was approximately 1.5%, from which a sharp increase in k(max) appeared; the k(rs) showed a slight increase with initial salt contents as well. Freeze-thaw yielded nonmonotonic changes in the permeability as k(max) peaked at 5 freeze-thaw cycles; the variation in k(rs) was similar. The osmotic suction positively correlated with k(max) but did not fully contribute to the sharp increase in k(max) since it increased linearly with the salt content without mutation points. The number of freeze-thaw cycles influenced the relationship between the osmotic suction and k(max). The matric and osmotic suctions posed opposite impacts on the permeability. More importantly, detailed discussions for the underlying mechanisms of the abovementioned novel observations were illustrated. These results may serve as good references for understanding the features of the permeability of dispersive soils in seasonally frozen regions domestically or worldwide.

AB Climate change will be particularly experienced though the medium of water. Water organisations, that are managing societal and ecological needs for water, are therefore likely to experience the impact the most. This study reviews the current literature regarding adaptation to climate change by water management organisations and associated barriers.
   Literature on adaptive capacity is growing and a general consensus is emerging on the determinants of adaptive capacity, although variations exist regarding how it is to be evaluated, enhanced and applied to policy making due to its dynamic, contextual and latent nature. Since adaptive capacity is hard to measure and successful adaptation difficult to define, some studies focus on the existence of adaptation attributes of organisations. Studies reporting successful adaptation are minimal and barriers of adaptation are being discovered as adaptation research transitions into implementation. But the root causes of these barriers are often overlooked and the interconnectedness of the barriers is poorly addressed.
   Increasingly, combining top-down and bottom-up approaches to adaptation is being recommended due to the limitations of each. However, knowledge regarding how organisations operating at different scales can enhance adaptive capacity of other organisations operating at another scale is lacking due to the few studies of inter-organisational networks across scales. Social networks among actors are recognised as a key factor to enable adaptation. However, network studies generally focus on individual actors and rarely between public agencies/organisations. Moreover, the current literature is inadequate to understand the relationship between adaptation enabling characteristics, barriers and adaptation manifestation. The review demonstrates that research on understanding the emergence and sustenance of barriers is urgently required. Addressing these knowledge gaps will help to improve the design of adaptation strategies, thereby improving the ability of water management to address the ongoing challenges of climate change.

AB The canopy storage capacity (S) is a major component of the surface water balance. We analysed the relationship between the tree canopy water storage capacity and leaf wettability under changing simulated rainfall temperature. We estimated the effect of the rain temperature change on the canopy storage capacity and contact angle of leave and needle surfaces based on two scenarios. Six dominant forest trees were analysed: English oak (Quercus roburL), common beech (Papas sylvatica L), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill), silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.),and Norway spruce (Picea abies L). Twigs of these species were collected from Krynica Zdroj, that is, the Experimental Forestry unit of the University of Agriculture in Cracow (southern Poland). Experimental analyses (simulations of precipitation) were performed in a laboratory under controlled conditions. The canopy storage capacity and leaf wettability classification were determined at 12 water temperatures and a practical calculator to compute changes of S and contact angles of droplets was developed. Among all species, an increase of the rainfall temperature by 0.7 degrees C decreases the contact angle between leave and needle surfaces by 2.41 degrees and increases the canopy storage capacity by 0.74 g g(-1); an increase of the rain temperature by 2.7 degrees C decreases the contact angle by 9.29 degrees and increases the canopy storage capacity by 2.85 g g(-1). A decreased contact angle between a water droplet and leaf surface indicates increased wettability. Thus, our results show that an increased temperature increases the leaf wettability in all examined species. The comparison of different species implies that the water temperature has the strongest effect on spruce and the weakest effect on oak. These data indicate that the rainfall temperature influences the canopy storage capacity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding how water moves through catchments - from the time it enters as precipitation to when it exits via streamflow - is of fundamental importance to understanding hydrological and biogeochemical processes. A basic descriptor of this routing is the Transit Time Distribution (TTD) which is derived from the input-output behavior of conservative tracers, the mean of which represents the average time elapsed between water molecules entering and exiting a flow system. In recent decades, many transit time studies have been conducted, but few of these have focused on snow-dominated catchments. We assembled a 10-year time series of isotopic data (delta O-18 and delta H-2) for precipitation and stream water to estimate the characteristics of the transit time distribution in a boreal catchment in northern Sweden. We applied lumped parameter models using a gamma distribution to calculate the Mean Transit Time (MTT) of water over the entire period of record and to evaluate how inter-annual differences in transit times relate to hydroclimatic variability. The best fit MTT for the complete 10-year period was 650 days (Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency = 0.65), while the best fit inter-annual MTT ranged from 300 days up to 1200 days. Whilst there was a weak negative correlation between mean annual total precipitation and the annual MTT, this relationship was stronger (r(2) = 0.53, p = 0.02) for the annual rain water input. This strong connection between the MTT and annual rainfall, rather than snowmelt, has strong implications for understanding future hydrological and biogeochemical processes in boreal regions, given that predicted warmer winters would translate into a greater proportion of precipitation falling as rain and thus shorter MTT in catchments. Such a change could have direct implications for the export of solutes and pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite fractured hard rock aquifers underlying over 65% of Ireland, knowledge of key processes controlling groundwater recharge in these bedrock systems is inadequately constrained. In this study, we examined 19 groundwater-level hydrographs from two Irish hillslope sites underlain by hard rock aquifers. Water-level time-series in clustered monitoring wells completed at the subsoil, soil/bedrock interface, shallow and deep bedrocks were continuously monitored hourly over two hydrological years. Correlation methods were applied to investigate groundwater-level response to rainfall, as well as its seasonal variations. The results reveal that the direct groundwater recharge to the shallow and deep bedrocks on hillslope is very limited. Water-level variations within these geological units are likely dominated by slow flow rock matrix storage. The rapid responses to rainfall (<= 2 h) with little seasonal variations were observed to the monitoring wells installed at the subsoil and soil/bedrock interface, as well as those in the shallow or deep bedrocks at the base of the hillslope. This suggests that the direct recharge takes place within these units. An automated time-series procedure using the water-table fluctuation method was developed to estimate groundwater recharge from the water-level and rainfall data. Results show the annual recharge rates of 42-197 mm/yr in the subsoil and soil/bedrock interface, which represent 4-19% of the annual rainfall. Statistical analysis of the relationship between the rainfall intensity and water-table rise reveal that the low rainfall intensity group (<= 1 mm/h) has greater impact on the groundwater recharge rate than other groups (>1 mm/h). This study shows that the combination of the time-series analysis and the water-table fluctuation method could be an useful approach to investigate groundwater recharge in fractured hard rock aquifers in Ireland.

AB Restoration of degraded floodplain forests requires a robust understanding of surface water, groundwater, and vadose zone hydrology. Soil moisture is of particular importance for seed germination and seedling survival, but is difficult to monitor and often overlooked in wetland restoration studies. This research hypothesizes that the complex effects of surface water and shallow groundwater on the soil moisture dynamics of floodplain wetlands are spatially complementary. To test this hypothesis, 31 long-term (4-year) hydrological time series were collected in the floodplain of the Loxahatchee River (Florida, USA), where watershed modifications have led to reduced freshwater flow, altered hydroperiod and salinity, and a degraded ecosystem. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA), a time series dimension reduction technique, was applied to model temporal and spatia variation in 12 soil moisture time series as linear combinations of common trends (representing shared but unexplained, variability) and explanatory variables (selected from 19 additional candidate hydrological time series). The resulting dynamic factor models yielded good predictions of observed soil moisture series (overall coefficient of efficiency = 0.90) by identifying surface water elevation, groundwater elevation, and net recharge (cumulative rainfall-cumulative evapotranspiration) as important explanatory variables. Strong and complementary linear relationships were found between floodplain elevation and surface water effects (slope = 0.72, R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.001), and between elevation and groundwater effects (slope = -0.71, R-2 = 0.71, p = 0.001), while the effect of net recharge was homogenous across the experimental transect (slope = 0.03, R-2 = 0.05, p = 0.242). This study provides a quantitative insight into the spatial structure of groundwater and surface water effects on soil moisture that will be useful for refining monitoring plans and developing ecosystem restoration and management scenarios in degraded coastal floodplains.

ID CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; MANAGEMENT
AB Streamflow trends in Indiana are evaluated for 31 USGS gauging stations that have 50 years or more continuous unregulated streamflow records. Trends are computed for selected streamflow statistics to include annual and seasonal low, medium, and high flow conditions by using four variations of the Mann-Kendall test. These variations include: (i) Mann-Kendall without autocorrelation, (ii) Mann-Kendall with lag-1 autocorrelation and trend-free pre-whitening, (iii) Mann-Kendall with complete autocorrelation structure, and (iv) Mann-Kendall with long term persistence. Mann-Kendall test is also applied to the precipitation data using the above four approaches to explore the relationship between precipitation and stream flow trends. Overall, there is an increasing trend in low and medium flow conditions across Indiana. However, these trend results are affected by the selection of flow statistic, annual/seasonal statistics, data length and consideration of autocorrelation structure. Specifically, the number of stations that show trends in low and medium flow statistics decreases significantly (up to 70%) when autocorrelation structure is considered in the analysis. The precipitation trends, however, are not affected by the autocorrelation structure, suggesting that factors other than precipitation trends are related to streamflow trends in Indiana. In addition, high flows are found to be less correlated to precipitation compared to low flows in heavily drained northern Indiana. This suggests that the subsurface drainage is playing a role in the observed streamflow trends in Indiana, but this issue needs further investigation. Overall, this study provides an elaborate view of past streamflow trends in Indiana which should be useful for further research including understanding the impact of future biofuel activities on Indiana hydrology and climate.

AB The travel time distribution (TTD) is a lumped representation of the age composition of water leaving the system. Under nonstationary rainfall injection conditions, the TTD varies with transient groundwater flow, leading to a time-variant TTD. It reflects water and solute exports responding to rainfall. The time-variant TTD, time-variant residence time distribution (RTD) and storage selection function (SAS function) provide fundamental insights into transport and mixing processes in groundwater flow system. This study investigates the control of local-scale mixing (i.e., molecular diffusion and pore-scale mechanical dispersion) on time-variant TTD, RTD and SAS function. A solute transport model is constructed to simulate the time-variant TTD, RTD and SAS function under the influence of local-scale mixing; and a particle tracking model is applied to simulated time-variant TTD, RTD and SAS function without the influence of local-scale mixing. Generally, the TTD and cumulative TTD are found to be more sensitive to local-scale mixing than RTD and cumulative RTD due to the 'volume effect'. The local-scale mixing smoothens the sharp fluctuations of backward TTD and SAS function. The differences of cumulative breakthrough curves and cumulative backward TTDs between two models deviate to negative value except the tails of the two functions, and this verifies the random velocity theory. The differences of cumulative RTDs between the two models indicate the hydrodynamic dispersion can result in more young water leaving the system and more old water remaining in the storage. Meanwhile, two rainfall time series, one with seasonality and one without seasonality, are applied in the two models separately; it is found that the hydrodynamic dispersion shapes the 2-dimensional backward TTD by increasing its continuity along the 45 degrees direction. Finally, the spatial distribution of mean groundwater age is used to illustrate the local-scale mixing in the aquifer and further explain the controls of local-scale mixing on time-variant TTD, RTD and SAS function mechanistically.

AB The Luanhe River basin, the mostly afforested river basin in North China, has exhibited significant land use/land cover change (LUCC) under climate change that could jointly affect water availability of the basin in the future. This study examines both impacts of LUCC and climate change on runoff over the upper reaches of the Luanhe River basin. First, the land use in 2020 is predicted based on the Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov). Second, a hydrological model (Soil Water Assessment Tools, SWAT) is set up for the baseline period 1961-1979 and driven primarily by outputs from five general circulation models (GCMs) under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) for the period 2020-2030. Results show that the ensemble mean annual precipitation may increase under four RCPs for the period 2020-2030, with the maximum (470 mm/yr) and minimum (444 mm/yr) for RCP8.5 and RCP6.0, respectively, 1-7% higher than the observed mean annual precipitation (441 mm/yr) during 1961-1979. The relationship between the runoff simulations and the RCPs under the 2020 land use scenario is nonlinear, with the maximum (57 mm/yr) and minimum (50 mm/yr) mean annual runoff depths under the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios, respectively, similar to 58% and similar to 39% higher than the mean annual observed runoff depth (36 mm/yr) for the baseline period. The increase in forestland (similar to 56%) and decrease in agriculture land (similar to -30%) are remarkable for the period 1970-2020, driven primarily by afforestation implemented in the Luanhe River basin. LUCC would lead to a slight decrease in mean annual runoff, and the runoff only increases in summer but decreases in other three seasons. The decrease in surface runoff and groundwater discharge jointly results in the overall decrease in runoff due to LUCC. In general, the climate change impact will dominate runoff change for the study basin, though marked afforestation has taken place and is likely to continue in the future.

AB Various data assimilation (DA) methods have been used and are being explored for use in operational streamflow forecasting. For ensemble forecasting, ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is an appealing candidate for familiarity and relative simplicity. EnKF, however, is optimal in the second-order sense, only if the observation equation is linear. As such, without an iterative approach, EnKF may not be appropriate for assimilating streamflow data for updating soil moisture states due to the strong nonlinear relationships between the two. Maximum likelihood ensemble filter (MLEF), on the other hand, is not subject to the above limitation. Being an ensemble extension of variational assimilation (VAR), MLEF also offers a strong connection with the traditional single-valued forecast process through the control, or the maximum likelihood, solution. In this work, we apply MLEF and EnKF as a fixed lag smoother to the Sacramento (SAC) soil moisture accounting model and unit hydrograph (UH) for assimilation of streamflow, mean areal precipitation (MAP) and potential evaporation (MAPE) data for updating soil moisture states. For comparative evaluation, three experiments were carried out. Comparison between homoscedastic vs. heteroscedastic modeling of selected statistical parameters for DA indicates that heteroscedastic modeling does not improve over homoscedastic modeling, and that homoscedastic error modeling with sensitivity analysis may suffice for application of MLEF for soil moisture updating using streamflow data. Comparative evaluation with respect to the model errors associated with soil moisture dynamics, the ensemble size and the number of streamflow observations assimilated per cycle showed that, in general, MLEF outperformed EnKF under varying conditions of observation and model errors, and ensemble size, and that MLEF performed well with an ensemble size as small as 5 while EnKF required a much larger ensemble size to perform closely to MLEF. Also, MLEF was not very sensitive to the uncertainty parameters and performed reasonably well over relatively wide ranges of parameter settings, an attribute desirable for operational applications where accurate estimation of such parameters is often difficult.

TI Alternative principal components regression procedures for

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID PACIFIC
AB Streamflow reconstruction using tree ring information (dendrohydrology) has traditionally used principal components analysis (PCA) and stepwise regression to form a transfer function. However, PCA has several procedural choices that may result in very different reconstructions. This study assesses the different procedures in PCA-based regression and suggests alternative procedures for selection of variables and principal components. Cross-validation statistics are presented as an alternative for independently testing and identifying the optimal model. The objective is to use these statistics as a measure of the model's performance to find a conceptually acceptable model with a low prediction error and the fewest number of variables. The results show that a parsimonious model with a low mean square error can be obtained by using strict rules for principal component selection and cross-validation statistics, Additionally, the procedure suggested in this study results in a model that is physically consistent with the relationship between the predictand and the predictor. The alternative PCA-based regression models presented here are applied to the reconstruction of the Upper Colorado River Basin streamflow and compared with results of a previous reconstruction using traditional procedures. The streamflow reconstruction proposed in this study shows more intense drought periods, which may influence the future allocation of water supply in the Colorado River Basin.

AB Cryogenic vacuum extraction (CVE) is the most widely used method for obtaining soil water for water stable isotope (H-2 and O-18) analysis; however, recent studies have shown that it may result in biased isotopic compositions. Here, we presented a method to correct the CVE biases and to assess the influence of the corrections on the conclusions from three different soil water isotope applications in hydrology. Four soil samples with different textures were oven-dried at 205 degrees C, wetted to varying water contents (0.05-0.30 g g(-1)) with reference water of known isotope composition, and then subjected to CVE for water extraction. The isotopic differences (biases) between the reference and extracted water were related to the soil textures and water contents. Then, the relationship was used to assess how the cryogenic extraction biases potentially influence soil water isotope applications based on data from three previous studies. The results showed that the biases for 84% CVE samples were more than twice the standard errors of currently available isotope analyzers, and biases increased significantly with increasing clay and decreasing water contents. Correction equations for CVE-obtained delta H-2 and delta O-18 were established: R-2 = 0.84, P < 0.01, and R-2 = 0.60, P < 0.01, respectively. When these corrections were applied to three different scenarios, they led to conclusions significantly different from those established with uncorrected values. This study provides a correction method for soil water vacuum extraction bias to improve the effectiveness of H-2 and O-18 applications in soil hydrology. We suggest that cryogenic extraction biases should be considered seriously for quantitative analysis under low water contents and with a narrow spread of isotopic compositions among the potential end-members.

AB Dissolved silica (DSi) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) stoichiometric coupling is collectively regulated by chemical weathering and algal activity, and potentially indicates the aquatic silicon retention and carbon emission in aquatic systems. Damming markedly remodels the hydrological conditions and aquatic biological activity, however, its effects on the spatiotemporal dynamics of coupled DSi and HCO3- remain poorly understood. Here we deciphered a 2-year hydrological and water quality dataset collected at multiple sites within an urban lake, namely Hanfeng Lake, the largest pre-dam of the Three Gorges Reservoir, to unravel the spatiotemporal dynamics of DSi and HCO3- and selected hydrological and water quality variables using cluster analysis, and to explore the best predictors for DSi:HCO3- using partial least squares regression. The changes of DSi, HCO3- and selected water variables could be characterized by spatial east and west zones, and further by temporal periods 1, 2 and 3 corresponding respectively to fluctuation stage, fluvial stage and lacustrine stage in each zone based on the hydrographic features of Hanfeng Lake. Wet season presented higher flow velocity, permanganate index, concentrations of DSi, HCO3-, nitrate-nitrogen and total suspended solids, and lower water level, secchi depth and chlorophyll-a, but equal DSi:HCO3- relative to dry season. DSi was overall negatively correlated with HCO3-, highlighting the dominant role of chemical weathering rather algal activity. DSi:HCO3- exhibited significant relationships with various variables, but was the best predictable using water level, permanganate index and nitrogen-based variables, suggesting the strong effects of water level fluctuation and pollution discharge on the coupling of silicon and carbon. Our results have great significance for understanding and modeling the biogeochemical cycles of silicon and carbon in the dam-induced lake ecosystems worldwide.

AB Estimating precipitation at high spatial-temporal resolution is vital in manifold hydrological, meteorological and water management applications, especially over areas with un-gauged networks and regions where water resources are on the wane. This study aims to evaluate five downscaling methods to determine the accuracy and efficiency of which on generating high-resolution precipitation data at annual and monthly scales. To establish precipitation-Land surface characteristics relationship, environmental factors, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM), were considered as proxies in the spatial downscaling procedure. The downscaling algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), geographically weighted regression (GWR), multiple linear regression (MLR) and exponential regression (ER), were implemented to downscale the version 7 of TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) precipitation (3B43 V7 product) over Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) from 0.25. to 1 km spatial resolution. The downscaled precipitation data was validated against observations from meteorological stations. Monthly fractions derived from TRMM 3B43 were used to disaggregate 1 km annual precipitation to 1 km monthly precipitation. Furthermore, the best method was selected for calibration based on Geographical Difference Analysis (GDA) to assess the effectiveness of the calibration as a viable option. The results indicate that SVM not only outperforms the other methods, but also has good agreements with in-situ measurements compared to the original TRMM. The results confirm that inclusion of LST and geographic information along with NDVI can improve the downscaling performance. Downscaling and GDA calibration significantly improve the accuracy of TRMM 3B43 product at both spatial and temporal resolution and should be considered as an essential step in calibration of TRMM precipitation. Calibration at monthly scale yields slightly better results than calibration at annual scale and then disaggregating into monthly maps in terms of accuracy assessment.

AB To quantify the surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) exchange flux in a river basin, the inclusion of SW-GW interaction (SGI) process in the next generation earth system models is of growing concern among the hydrologic community that requires a trade-off among model complexity linking streamflow and groundwater flow domains, spatial heterogeneity, and computational demand. Although semi-distributed SGI models seem to be a plausible solution, the question is 'what could be the effective way to decompose a river basin to assess the subsurface flux'? Therefore, this study intends to search for a better alternative approach for catchment decomposition between the hillslope- and hydrologic response unit (HRU)-based SGI models; the inherent relationship between the decomposition level and model efficiency; and the appropriate spatial scale of decomposition for hillslopes and HRUs. The typical hydrological models chosen for this study are: the hillslope-based coupled Variable Parameter McCarthy-Muskingum-enhanced hillslope storage Boussinesq (VPMM-ehsB), and the HRU-based coupled Soil and Water Assessment Tool-MODular three-dimensional groundwater FLOW (SWATMODFLOW). These semi-distributed models are field-tested to model the streamflow accounting for lateral contributions along the river reach, baseflow, depth to water table, and the SGI flux. The results reveal that the VPMM-ehsB model with hillslope-grid based decomposition outperformed the SWAT-MODFLOW with the HRUgrid based hybrid decomposition in explaining the variance of the entire annual and low (non-monsoon) streamflow time series by 12% and 25%, respectively. The VPMM-ehsB approach has a faster (36%) simulation time than that of the SWAT-MODFLOW showing the potential of the hillslope decomposition approach in the VPMM-ehsB model over the HRU-based approach in the SWAT-MODFLOW for large-scale application in future earth system models.

AB Emitter discharge is one of the most important parameters considered in the design, operation, and management of subsurface irrigation systems. The emitter discharge, if properly chosen, can eliminate surface runoff and minimize deep percolation water losses. The discharge from a ceramic emitter depends on the working pressure head and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity, so it is important to determine the optimal working levels for these two design parameters. In this work, it is confirmed that the HYDRUS-2D predictions of the cumulative infiltration and the horizontal wetting front are in good agreement with experimental results, and that the Hydrus-2D model can be used to accurately simulate soil water movement under subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters. Additional simulations with HYDRUS-2D were used to study the effects of various design parameters (i.e. working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity) on emitter discharges in soils, deep percolation and soil wetting fronts. Results show that both the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity have significant impact on the discharge of emitters in soil, and the deep percolation water losses. The emitter discharge in soil decreases with time and finally stabilizes. When the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity are higher, the stable discharge (emitter discharge in soil at 120 h) is greater, and this situation may increase the risk of deep percolation. The relationship between the working pressure head, ceramic hydraulic conductivity, and stable discharge is developed as a power function. To satisfy the water requirements of trees with an active layer of root systems down to about 0-100 cm in the Loess Plateau in China and reduce the risk of deep percolation, it is recommended that the working pressure head should be 20-50 cm of water and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity should be between 0.1 and 1.9 cm h(-1).

AB Soil erosion and sediment delivery to streams are important environmental problems and major concerns in sustainable development. In recent years several tools have been proposed for assessing the delivery of sediment from hillslopes to stream networks, but there are still few examples of their application to large basins, and studies include a discussion of calibration and validation issues. In this study a spatially distributed soil erosion and sediment delivery model (WATEM/SEDEM) was applied to the watershed of the Barasona Reservoir (1504 km(2), Central Spanish Pyrenees), which is drained by the Esera and Isabena Rivers. Model calibration and validation was based on the depositional history of the Barasona Reservoir and suspended sediment records over 3 years (May 2005-May 2008) at the outlet of the Isabena River. Despite interannual differences in precipitation and runoff, it was possible to establish an optimum value (7-23) for the kit parameter. This enabled estimation of the long-term average annual sediment yield to the reservoir, as well as the relative contribution of each river. Large spatial variability in hillslope sediment delivery was found, and the major sediment sources were in the lower part of the watershed (agricultural fields) and in the badlands developed on Eocene marls in the middle part of the watershed (Pyrenean Inner Ranges). The relative importance of sediment source areas was assessed in relation to land use, and the relationship between the sediment delivery ratio and the catchment area was studied as a function of the geomorphological units. For the moment WATEM/SEDEM remains mainly as a researcher's tool, until either the problem of the scarcity of soil erosion data or the need for calibration of the transport parameters will be solved.

AB The time-domain electromagnetic method (TDEM) is widely used in groundwater exploration and geological mapping applications. TDEM measures subsurface electrical conductivity, which is strongly correlated with groundwater salinity. TDEM offers a cheap and non-invasive option for mapping saltwater intrusion and groundwater salinization. Traditionally, TDEM data is interpreted using one-dimensional layered-earth models of the subsurface. However, most saltwater intrusion and groundwater salinization phenomena are characterized by three-dimensional anomalies. To fully exploit the information content of TDEM data in this context, three-dimensional modeling of the TDEM response is required.
   We present a finite-element solution for three-dimensional forward modeling of TDEM responses from arbitrary subsurface electrical conductivity distributions. The solution is benchmarked against standard layered-earth models and previously published three-dimensional forward TDEM modeling results. Concentration outputs from a groundwater flow and salinity transport model are converted to subsurface electrical conductivity using standard petrophysical relationships. TDEM responses over the resulting subsurface electrical conductivity distribution are generated using the three-dimensional TDEM forward model. The parameters of the hydrodynamic model are constrained by matching observed and simulated TDEM responses.
   As an application example, a field dataset of ground-based TDEM data from an island in the Okavango Delta is presented. Evaporative salt enrichment causes a strong salinity anomaly under the island. We show that the TDEM field data cannot be interpreted in terms of standard one-dimensional layered-earth TDEM models, because of the strongly three-dimensional nature of the salinity anomaly. Three-dimensional interpretation of the field data allows for detailed and consistent mapping of this anomaly and makes better use of the information contained in the TDEM field dataset.

   to irrigation
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Murray-Darling Basin; Climate change; Environmental flows; Irrigation
   economics; Water allocation
AB Increasing river environment degradation from historical growth in withdrawal is leading to reallocation of water from irrigation in many basins. We examine how potential reduction in irrigation allocations under a newly enacted environmental water plan for the Murray Darling Basin in Australia, in combination with projected climate change, impact on flows, diversions and the economic returns to irrigation.
   We use an integrated hydrology-economics model capable of simulating the year-to-year variability of flows, diversions, and economic returns to model three levels of reallocation (2400, 2750 and 3200 GL) under the historical climate, and under a dry, a median and a wet climate change projection. Previous assessments of the reallocation plan do not address climate change impacts, nor the impact of year to year variability in flows on economic returns.
   The broad results of this analysis are that estimated river flows and diversions are more sensitive to the range of climate change projections than to the range of diversion reallocation scenarios considered. The projected median climate change more or less removes from flows the gains to the environment resulting from reallocation. Reallocations only in combination with no climate change, or climate change at the wetter end of the range of projections, will lead to flows greater than those experienced under the water management regime prior to reallocation.
   The reduction in economic returns to irrigation is less than the reduction in water available for irrigation: a 25% reduction in the annual average water availability is estimated to reduce the annual average gross value of irrigated agricultural production by about 10%. This is consistent with expectation of economic theory (since more marginal activities are reduced first) and also with observations of reduced water availability and returns in the recent drought in the Murray-Darling Basin. Irrigation returns vary less across the range of climate change projections considered than across the range of reallocation scenarios considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluation of hydrodynamic scaling in porous media using finger
   dimensions
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID WETTING FRONT INSTABILITY; SOILS
AB The use of dimensionless scaling is ubiquitous to hydrodynamic analysis, providing a powerful method of extending limited experimetnal results and generalizing theories. Miller and Miller [1956] contributed a scaling framework for immiscible fluid flow through porous media that relied on consistency of the contact angle between systems to be compared. It is common to assume that the effective contact angle will be zero in clean sand material where water is the wetting liquid. The well-documented unstable wetting process of fingered flow is used here as a diagnostic tool for the scaling relationships for infiltration into sandy media. Through comparison of finger cross sections produced using three liquids as well as various concentrations of anionic surfactant, it is shown that the zero contact angle assumption is very poor even for laboratory cleaned silica sand: Experimental results demonstrate effective contact angles approaching 60 degrees. Scaling was effective for a given liquid between sands of differing particle size. These results suggest that caution should be exercised when applying scaling theory to initial wetting of porous media by liquids of differing gas-liquid interfacial tensions.

AB As a costliest natural hazard, drought profoundly affects water resources, agriculture, and socio-economic sectors in India. In spite of large spatio-temporal variability in droughts, the propagation time from meteorological to hydrological droughts is not examined at local scale over India. In this study, the meteorological and hydrological variables are obtained at a grid resolution of 0.5 degrees Lat x 0.5 degrees Lon over India to estimate the time of propagation. Here, five different runoff datasets from ERA5, FLDAS, GLDAS, MEERA2, and NCEP are collected. The Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and Standardised Runoff Index (SRI) are estimated under the influence of external global and regional drivers. The drought propagation time is computed in 1170 grids blanketing the entire India based on differences between the initiation to initiation (As), peak to peak (Ap) and termination to termination (Ae). In addition, the internal propagation of hydrological drought is estimated with the help of variable motion relationship of speed-time process. The large duration and more severe hydrological droughts are observed mostly over southern and northern parts of India. The drought propagation time varies between 4 and 9 months, 9 to 12 months, and 15 to 20 months in the cases of As, Ap, and Ae, respectively. The drought development and recovery duration are computed as 3.1 to 6 months over most of the areas. It is found that locations with the high value (greater than 10 months) of Drought Development Period (DDP) are also having high value of Drought Recovery Period (DRP). The internal propagation of hydrological drought ranges between the magnitude of 0.4 and 0.6 per month over most of the area in India. It is found that the drought propagation and its characteristics are underestimated over most of the regions in India when computed without the external drivers. The present study would provide important drought characteristics at local scale which can assist water managers and policy makers to devise sustainable management practices.

AB Understanding stream runoff generation processes requires distributed stream runoff estimates; however the acquisition of such estimates remains challenging in hydrology, especially in remote areas. In regions with a high spatial density of small reservoirs, those reservoirs could be employed to gauge stream runoff (Liebe et al., 2009). Using a water balance approach, the stream runoff flowing into a reservoir from a drainage catchment could be estimated. Accordingly, this work aims to address the following two questions: i) what is the error in the estimated stream runoff and ii) what are the main estimation uncertainty factors? Based on a case study of the Kamech catchment, Tunisia, stream runoff was estimated at different temporal resolutions (1-32 days), and a global sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the contributions of the reservoir water balance terms (evaporation, rainfall, percolation, reservoir water level and level-area-volume relations) to the estimated stream runoff uncertainty.
   The results reveal that stream runoff can be reliably estimated based on small reservoirs using a mass balance approach. The error and global stream runoff estimation uncertainties decrease as the temporal resolution increases. The bathymetric relationships (level-area and level-volume relations) constitute a strong factor of uncertainty for all temporal resolutions, and even the dominant factor for temporal resolutions ranging from 4 to 23 days. The estimation uncertainty for the shortest temporal resolutions (1-8 days) mainly originates from reservoir level uncertainty. As the temporal resolution increases, the contribution of percolation uncertainty increases. The general (not site-specific) conclusions of this study are that stream runoff gauging based on small reservoirs requires the determination of the bathymetric relations and that small reservoirs could be used as reliable stream runoff gauges at short temporal resolutions if the reservoir level is measured with limited uncertainty and at long temporal resolutions as long as the percolation rate from the reservoir is known with limited uncertainty.

AB Surface runoff is one of the hydrological processes involved in floods, pollution transfer, soil erosion and mudslide. Many models allow the simulation and the mapping of surface runoff and erosion hazards. Field observations of this hydrological process are not common although they are crucial to evaluate surface runoff models and to investigate or assess different kinds of hazards linked to this process. In this study, a simple field monitoring network is implemented to assess the relevance of a surface runoff susceptibility mapping method. The network is based on spatially distributed observations (nine different locations in the catchment) of soil water content and rainfall events. These data are analyzed to determine if surface runoff occurs. Two surface runoff mechanisms are considered: surface runoff by saturation of the soil surface horizon and surface runoff by infiltration excess (also called hortonian runoff). The monitoring strategy includes continuous records of soil surface water content and rainfall with a 5 min time step. Soil infiltration capacity time series are calculated using field soil water content and in situ measurements of soil hydraulic conductivity. Comparison of soil infiltration capacity and rainfall intensity time series allows detecting the occurrence of surface runoff by infiltration-excess. Comparison of surface soil water content with saturated water content values allows detecting the occurrence of surface runoff by saturation of the soil surface horizon. Automatic records were complemented with direct field observations of surface runoff in the experimental catchment after each significant rainfall event. The presented observation method allows the identification of fast and short-lived surface runoff processes at a small spatial and temporal resolution in natural conditions. The results also highlight the relationship between surface runoff and factors usually integrated in surface runoff mapping such as topography, rainfall parameters, soil or land cover. This study opens interesting prospects for the use of spatially distributed measurement for surface runoff detection, spatially distributed hydrological models implementation and validation at a reasonable cost.

AB Water use efficiency (WUE) determined by water-carbon coupling process is important to evaluate the rela-tionship between crop growth and water consumption. Aiming to provide a novel WUE dynamic evaluating method at field scale, we developed a crop WUE model based on stomata, which coupled the processes of crop growth and farmland water cycle. In previous work, we developed a stomatal conductance model in which crop stomatal conductance could be described by its relationship to meteorological factors, soil water and salinity. In this study, we coupled crop transpiration and photosynthesis based on stomata. Furthermore, the model described the daily crop growth and hydrological processes. As a result, the developed model could simulate the dynamic changes of crop canopy evapotranspiration (ET), canopy photosynthesis, dry matter accumulation and assimilation distribution, soil water movement, soil salt transport and WUE of farmland ecosystems on a daily scale. Three years field experimental data were used to calibrate the developed model. The results showed that the model could simulate the variation of agricultural hydrology processes properly in sunflower field on the daily scale, with determination coefficient (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of ET, transpira-tion and WUE all close to 0.60. R2 and NSE of net ecosystem productivity above 0.74 and 0.68, respectively. And the coupling model had a good performance in simulating the dynamic change process of soil moisture and salt with the R-2 and NSE above 0.71 and 0.61, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters showed that the selection of the extinction coefficient had a great influence on the accuracy of the model and the accurate description of soil resistance parameters played a crucial role in the accurate quantification of ET. The developed field WUE model can provide novel method to evaluate daily hydrological processes, agricultural productivity and WUE dynamics.

AB Groundwater is essential for agricultural, ecological and domestic water use, and its depletion under climatic and anthropogenic impacts can impose challenges on regional water resources and ecological security, particularly in arid regions. Spatiotemporal variation and drivers of groundwater are critical to understand groundwater cycling and restore groundwater, while they are poorly understood in arid oasis region due to sparse field monitoring. To address this, we examined the spatiotemporal variations and controlling factors of groundwater level and mineralization degree using data collected at 22 wells in the Wei-Ku Oasis of Tarim Basin during 2000-2018, a typical arid inland river basin in northwest China. Results showed that obviously large spatial and temporal variations existed in both DGL (depth to groundwater level) and DM (degree of mineralization). Groundwater level was the shallowest in spring and deepest in autumn. DGL exhibited a markedly increasing trend (2.05 m per decade), while DM marginally decreased (-0.21 g/L per decade) (p < 0.001) during 2000-2018. The spatial distributions of DGL and DM were complex. Larger variation of DGL/DM generally occurred at the areas with greater DGL/DM. DM in the northwestern part was obviously smaller than that in the southeastern part. The variation of DGL in the eastern region was noticeably larger than that in the western region. Human activity was the main driving factor of DGL increasing, climate change had a dominant role in DM decreasing, and the relationship between controlling factors and groundwater varied in space and season. Decreasing riverbank leakage and increasing volume of evapotranspiration, groundwater pumping and water drainage led to decreasing groundwater level, while increasing infiltration/leakage from irrigated water, canal and reservoir resulted in increasing groundwater level. The results could help to advance the understanding of groundwater cycling mechanism, and be useful in improving sustainable groundwater management and restoring ecosystem in arid region.

AB Subsurface pipe drainage (SPD) has been widely applied in arid and semiarid regions to control soil salinization. To increase the accuracy of HYDRUS-2D simulations in SPD, three effective strategies, including the resistance layer (RL), actual infiltration surface (AIS), and equivalent radius (ER) treatments, were proposed to replace the standard seepage boundary (SSB) for subsurface pipes in HYDRUS-2D. First, the accuracy of the three strategies was calibrated using laboratory experiments with the multi-objective calibration method of the PEST program. Second, additional laboratory experiments were conducted to validate the three strategies. The RL, AIS, and ER strategies obtained a relatively high simulation accuracy in terms of the soil salt content (SSC), soil water content (SWC), and drainage and salt discharge processes that was significantly higher than that obtained with the standard seepage boundary (SSB) strategy. Moreover, compared with the AIS, ER, and SSB strategies, the RL strategy attained the highest simulation accuracy regarding the water drainage (root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.42 L; mean absolute error (MAE) = 2.91 L) and salt discharge (RMSE = 0.12 kg; MAE = 0.11 kg) in SPD. The relative position of the subsurface pipe has an important effect on the desalting rate of the clay layer (CL). Based on the SPD simulation by HYDRUS-2D with the RL strategy, we recommend placing the subsurface pipe below the clay layer to obtain the best water drainage and salt discharge effects in regions containing CLs. Furthermore, a positive logarithmic relationship between the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe and the CL saturated hydraulic conductivity was found (R-2 = 0.99). Future research should focus on the upper and lower boundary conditions of HYDRUS-2D to further increase the SPD simulation accuracy.

AB The contamination or deficiency of Selenium (Se) has become a critical issue in watershed systems worldwide during the past half-century, with either elevated or deficient Se concentrations in groundwater, surface water, soils, and associated vegetation. Regardless of the reason for concern, there is a basic need for tools for use in assessing baseline concentrations and mass loadings in large-scale environmental systems and for exploring remediation strategies. This paper presents the application of UZF-RT3D, a multispecies variably-saturated reactive transport model for groundwater systems, and its recently developed Se agricultural and chemical reaction module to a regional study site (50,600 ha) along the irrigated Arkansas River Valley in southeastern Colorado. The study region has been monitored for Se contamination during the previous decade, with all segments of the Arkansas River impaired with respect to Se. The Se reaction module accounts for near-surface Se cycling due to agricultural practices, oxidation-reduction reactions, and sorption, and includes a nitrogen cycle and reaction module due to the dependence of Se transformation and speciation on the presence of nitrate (NO3). Of prime importance is the role NO3 plays in oxidation of residual Se from marine shale, which is prevalent throughout the study region, along with its inhibition of Se chemical reduction to less toxic forms. The model is corroborated against groundwater solute concentrations, mass loadings of solutes to the Arkansas River, relationships between solutes within the groundwater system, and overall regional statistics of groundwater solute concentration. Results indicate that the model is successful in replicating the major spatial and temporal patterns in Se and NO3 contamination and transport, hence providing a tool that can be used with confidence to explore remediation schemes.

AB We analyzed the temporal variability modes of annual maximum flow of 15 pristine tributaries of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec during the 1934-2000 period in relation to six climatic indices, using principal component analysis, linear regression, the Mann-Kendall test, correlation analysis and canonical correlation analysis. As for temporal variability modes, we identified three variability modes: two on the south shore (on both sides of 47 degrees N) and one on the north shore. A statistically significant temporal trend (positive trend) was observed in the flood time series of the north shore mode only. This increase appears to be due to the continental nature of the climate, which features a strong contrast between the rainy decades (positive anomaly) and the dry ones (negative anomaly). The former (the 1970s and 1980s) followed the latter (the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s). However, the three modes were characterized by two synchronous anomaly periods on a decadal scale: a negative anomaly during the 1950s and a positive anomaly during the 1970s. That said, these two synchronous periods were characterized by greater amplitude on the north shore than on the south shore. Thus, the dry (wet) periods were dryer (wetter) on the north shore than on the south shore. As for the relationship between the climatic indices and streamflow, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) was correlated to the north shore mode. ENSO (El Nino/Southern Oscillation Index) was correlated to the south shore mode located north of 47 degrees N) and AO (Arctic Oscillation) was correlated to the south shore mode located south of this parallel. This study shows that floods are not influenced by the same climatic indices on both shores of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four distinct approaches, that vary markedly in the spatial and temporal resolution of their measurement and process-level outputs, are used to investigate the daily and seasonal water vapour exchange in a 70-year-old Belgian Scots pine forest. Transpiration, canopy interception, soil evaporation and evapotranspiration are simulated, using a stand-level process model (SECRETS) and a soil water balance model (WAVE). Simulated transpiration was compared with up-scaled sap flow measurements and simulated evapotranspiration to eddy covariance measurements.
   Reasonable agreement in the temporal trends and in the annual water balance between the two models was observed, however daily and weekly predictions often diverged. Most notably, WAVE estimated very low, to no transpiration during late autumn, winter and early spring when incident radiation fell below similar to50 W m(-2) while SECRETS simulated low (0.1-0.4 mm day(-1)) fluxes during the same period. Both models exhibited similar daily trends in simulated transpiration when compared with sap flow estimates, although simulations from SECRETS were more closely aligned. In contrast, WAVE over-estimated transpiration during periods of no rainfall and under-estimated transpiration during rainfall. Yearly, total evapotranspiration simulated by the models were similar, i.e. 658 mm (1997) and 632 mm (1998) for WAVE and 567 mm (1997) and 619 mm (1998) for SECRETS.
   Maximum weekly-average evapotranspiration for WAVE exceeded 5 mm day(-1), while SECRETS never exceeded 4 mm day(-1). Both models, in general, simulated higher evapotranspiration than that measured with the eddy covariance technique. An impact of the soil water content in the direct relationship between the models and the eddy covariance measurements was found.
   The results suggest that: (1) different model formulations can reproduce similar results depending on the scale at which outputs are resolved, (2) SECRETS estimates of transpiration were well correlated with the empirical measurements, and (3) neither model fitted favourably to the eddy covariance technique.

AB Identifying the flood susceptible areas is a vital and substantial element of disaster management for every country to control and mitigate injuries of the natural hazards. The current research presents a framework for the preparation of flood prone areas' maps by the integration of Geospatial Information System (GIS), fuzzy logic, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). To achieve this goal, a spectrum of geophysical, geomorphological, meteorological, hydrological, and geographical criteria have been addressed. Considering the linkage and the interdependencies of the criteria, DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach are used to form the network of relations among the criteria. Moreover, considering inevitable uncertainty, ambiguity/vagueness of the experts' opinions, fuzzy theory is integrated with DEMATEL to handle the issue. Finally, Analytic Network Process (ANP) are implemented to calculate the final weight of every single criterion. The Kurdistan province, located in the North-West of Iran, is considered as the case study in which numerous flood events has had recently happened. The efficiency of the model is assessed through the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures such as the Kappa index. In order to evaluate the produced classified flood susceptibility map, the map of historical flood events in the province is also used. About 85% of validation area is classified as "Very High flood Susceptible" which implies the efficiency of proposed framework for flood susceptibility mapping. Furthermore, for evaluating the functionality of the framework in comparison with traditional approaches, the well-known AHP methodology is implemented too. The validation results demonstrate that the Fuzzy-DEMATEL ANP model (AUC-ROC = 0.938, Kappa = 0.88) has a higher performance accuracy compare to the AHP model (AUC-ROC = 0.918, Kappa = 0.79). Moreover, comparing the proposed and validation model shows that the proposed framework can effectively improve decision makers to provide flood susceptibility maps, and recognize flood susceptible areas in data-scarce and ungauged regions.

AB Predictions regarding extremes of surface precipitation and temperature from climate models are potentially useful for developing water resources management decisions. The present paper uses a probabilistic utility index based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov formulae for discriminating high versus low variability in watershed mean areal precipitation and temperature and watershed-outlet discharge in the Korean Peninsula on the basis of climate model simulations of high versus low nodal surface precipitation and temperature. The theory is based on the Georgakakos [Georgakakos, K.P., 2003. Probabilistic climate-model diagnostics for hydrologic and water resources impact studies. J. Hydrometeorol. 4, 92-105] general. development that allows for ensemble climate model simulations and variable-size analysis windows centered on the watershed of interest. In this study, for the first time, single and ensemble simulations from four atmospheric general circulation models with grid box areas ranging from 200 x 200 km(2) to 400 x 500 km(2) and with varying physical parameterizations and sea surface temperature forcing (observed versus persisted) are used to discriminate concurrent extreme values of the observed watershed variables in watersheds with largest area of approximately 26,000 km(2). The analysis is done for a variety of periods and temporal resolutions. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to identify values of the utility index that are significant at the 5% level in each case. The utility index is computed for standardized anomalies of the variables of interest. The utility analysis shows that climate simulations have significant potential value for all watersheds in the Korean Peninsula especially for water resources management applications that use watershed mean areal temperature. The study also shows that several climate models are potentially useful in various seasons for discriminating extremes in watershed mean areal. precipitation and watershed-outlet discharge for the Korean watersheds. Although single climate model simulations would be useful, the character of the results suggests that multi-model ensembles would be particularly useful for water resources management applications.

   LINEAR FILTER THEORY
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSFER-FUNCTION MODEL; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; CONDUCTIVITY; FATE
AB Description of flow in soils with macropores is difficult, yet quite important in describing the dynamics of field soils. Recognizing the two Structural domains of the macropore and matrix, and possible water-flow situations, three flow regions have been suggested: matrix, macropore, and transaction. The matrix and the macropore are the two domains, and the transaction represents the exchange of water between the matrix and the macropore. As a beginning point for the description of such systems, linear filter theory is applied to the Richards equation to obtain a general set of analytical solutions for water and contaminant movement in unsaturated soil in which there are no macropores. To develop these solutions, a unique relationship between water flux (q) and water content (0) is demonstrated by executing a numerical simulation based on the Richards equation. By piece-wise curve fitting of q(0), it is possible to establish and obtain a set of equations which describe water flow and chemical movement in soil, and which take the form of linear filter systems, providing analytical solutions by convolution. A two-domain approach applies equations for homogeneous soil to describe the matrix domain, with the macropore domain described with coefficients obtained by applying the Poiseuille and Chezy equations. These equations are analytically solved in correspondence with the three flow situations, resulting in a model, LASOMS (linear analytical solutions of macropore soils). Simulations, data and model comparisons of LASOMS have shown the above solutions to be reasonable under several conditions.

AB Mountain snowmelt is a critical water resource for achieving food and water security in drylands. Climate change impacts the snowmelt and consequently water resources reliability in downstream communities in drylands. Data limitation is one of the main challenges for assessing such impacts. This study assessed the trend in snow depth (SD), snowy day to wet day (SDWD), and snow phenology-related metrics in data-scarce snowy areas of Iran over 1987-2017. Furthermore, the contribution of temperature warming, precipitation and Arctic Oscillation (AO) anomalies to the snow metrics trends was investigated. The analyses were performed using the more accurate reanalyses selected between ERA-Interim and ERAS. The trend magnitude and significance were also assessed during the December-January-February (DJF), March-April (MA), and December-January-February-March-April (DJFMA) using the Sen's estimator and Mann-Kendall (MK) test, respectively. Given the ERA5's superiority, this product was employed for the trend and contribution analyses. The SD, SDWD and snow cover duration (S-dur) had a decreasing trend at more than 90% of study area. Except for snow cover onset date (D-s), MK detected a significant trend in the snow metrics at 40% or more of the studied regions. The more humid regions experienced a greater SD reduction. The SDWDDJF also decreased by less than 1% for the areas having average winter wintertime temperature below the threshold of -2.80 degrees C. The downward trend in S-dur was largely due to the earlier snowmelt rather than later D-s. A decline of 5 > day per decade was found for S-dur at the areas with DJFMA temperature below the melting point. The SD, SDWD and phenology metrics changes can be accounted for by temperature warming in most regions. The SDWD-AO relationship was statistically significant for the majority of the cases. The AO anomalies seem to impact SDWD via affecting wintertime temperature. The decrease of snow metrics indicates the occurrence of more severe and frequent dry snow droughts in the studied sub-basins. Thus, drought adaptation strategies need to consider the patterns of snow metrics in addition to total precipitation under global warming. The ERAS outputs can be applied for evaluating snow drought under data scarcity.

AB Trends in flow discharge, temperature and rainfall from the Qom Rood Watershed, Iran, for a period of 1979-2016 were analyzed at monthly and annual time scales. Trend analyses were conducted using the Mann-Kendall test, the double-mass curve of mean annual discharge versus rainfall, and rainfall runoff relationship before and after the 15 Khordad Dam operation. Multiple regression of flow discharge against rainfall and temperature was used to determine the residual trend at four meteorological and hydrological stations located upstream and downstream of the Qom Rood Watershed. Results showed that the temperature at the upstream and downstream stations did not have any significant trend, but a significant decreasing trend (P < .05) in rainfall was detected only in May (z = -1.66) at the downstream stations. There was a significant positive trend (P < .05) in rainfall in February (z = 2.22) and July (z = 2.15) at the upstream stations, and in October (z = 2.3) and November (z = 1.8) at the downstream stations. However, there was a noticeable decrease in monthly and annual flow discharge, and residual trend at 99% significance level at the downstream stations. At the upstream stations, the flow discharges had significant (P < .05) declining trend in all months, but annual flow discharge did not change significantly. Analysis of double mass curve between runoff and rainfall at the downstream stations showed an inconsistency in the line slope concordant with the time of 15 Khordad Dam operation. Annual mean discharge at the upstream stations did not show a significant change before and after 15 Khordad Dam operation. However, annual flow magnitude decreased significantlyby 87.5 and 81.7% in Shad Abad and KoohSefid, respectively. These results confirmed that natural driving forces did not affect flow discharge changes and the observed decreasing tendency in flow discharge at the downstream stations was due to 15 Khordad Dam, and at the upstream stations due to diversion/storage dams. These findings highlighted the role of human interference in changing the hydrologic regime in the study area based on which appropriate adaptive decisions can be made. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The soil moisture (SM) data retrieved from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite are available at a 9km grid spacing since April 2015. This product can provide valuable information for research and applications in hydrology and other related fields. However, the resolution may be too coarse for applications at catchment or field scale. In this study, an established downscaling methodology, which had a major modification regarding its application on the SMAP 33 km domain, was implemented to develop a 1 km soil moisture product based on the SMAP 9km data. The algorithm proposed here is based on the thermal inertia principle and developed by modeling the relationship between surface temperature difference and SM for different Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) classes. The model functions were established and tuned using data from the NASA's Land Information System (LIS) North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) and remotely sensed VISible/InfRared (VIS/IR) reflectance data from Long Term Data Record (LTDR) AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) for the growing season months of April-September 1981-2018. These were then implemented using the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data over the Continental United States (CONUS) domain. Validation activities were carried out using in situ measurements distributed through the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The validation results computed using the 1 km SM data showed that the R-2, unbiased RMSE (root mean square error) and bias were improved relative to the 9km SMAP product by 0.045, 0.018 m(3)/m(3) and 0.001 m(3)/m(3), respectively. The 1 km SM also exhibited a strong time-series autocorrelation. Further accuracy assessment analyses indicated that precipitation might contribute to the uncertainties in both the 9km SMAP and 1 km downscaled SMAP SM products.

AB Under the increasing risk of water scarcity, aquifer management strategies can take advantage of a deeper knowledge about the natural long-term fluctuations driven by climate patterns. This study examines the links between major large-scale atmospheric circulation modes and inter-annual to decadal oscillations in groundwater levels in Portugal. Precipitation and piezometric records (1987-2016) from two aquifer systems, Leirosa-Monte Real in the north and Querenca-Silves in the south, are analyzed using wavelet transform methods and singular spectral analysis. Wavelet coherences computed between hydrologic time series and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic (EA) and Scandinavia (SCAND) climate patterns show non-stationary relationships that are nonetheless consistent in distinct period bands. The strongest covariability occurs in the 6-10 years band for NAO, in the 2-4 years band for EA (especially after 1999) and in the 4-6 years band for SCAND (mainly after 2005). NAO is the mode playing the most relevant role with a stronger influence in the south (60% on average) than in the north (40% on average). The relatively higher frequency ( < 5 year period) contributions of EA and SCAND are difficult to set apart but their joint impact accounts for approximately 20% and 40% of the total variance of groundwater levels in the south and north of the country, respectively. Wavelet coherence patterns also expose transitive couplings between NAO, EA and SCAND. Often, coupled phases between climate modes mark abrupt transitions in synchronization patterns and shifts in the time-frequency domain. Extremes in groundwater storage coincide with anti-phase NAO and EA combinations: maximum piezometric levels occur during NAO-EA + (coincidentally also SCAND + ) phases while minimum levels occur during NAO + EA - phases.

AB Choosing an appropriate method for combining single-value forecasts should depend on characteristics of the individual forecasts being combined and their relationships with each other. This study attempts to develop a guideline to choose effective combining techniques by using analytical derivations and/or hydrological experiments. The two most popular combining techniques, Simple Average (SA) and Weighted Average (WA), are compared from theoretical angles. The standard deviation of the combined forecast error is quantified as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation and the correlation coefficient between the two constituent forecast errors. Following the theoretical study, empirical research for eight combining methods including SA and WA methods was conducted to confirm the theoretical findings of this study and to verify results from other research carried out. The results of the empirical experiments are summarized to confirm the effects of the eight combining methods. The major findings include that: (1) SA yields reasonable results for any combination of forecasts when information of constituent forecasts is absent. (2) one cannot expect combining technique to yield significant improvement when two constituent forecasts are highly correlated, (3) the Regression and ANN combining methods can remove the effects of bias in the constituent forecasts and yield unbiased combining forecasts, and (4) when the constituent forecasts have nonstationary errors, a time-varying-weight combining method yields better results than the constant-weight methods in most cases. Based on these theoretical findings and empirical results, a guideline for combining methods is provided. The guideline suggests appropriate methods for combining single-value streamflow forecasts by considering bias and nonstationarity of the errors in the individual forecasts; the ratio of the error variance of any two forecasts and cross-correlation among the forecasts.

AB Seasonal variability of the energy partitioning was analyzed with a combination of eddy fluxes of sensible and latent heat and weather data on intensely farmed land in the savanna area of Eastern Burkina Faso, West Africa. The analysis covers two rainy seasons (May-October 2003 and 2004), one dry season (December-April 2004), one dry to wet transition period (May-June 2004) and two wet to dry transition periods (October-November 2003 and 2004). This is the first long-term flux measurement reported upon for this part of the world.
   The inter-annual partitioning of the available energy between the latent heat (actual evaporation) and sensible heat flux shows a conservative relationship between a decrease in annual rainfall (33%) and the sum of the increase in sensible heat flux (20%) and decrease in latent heat flux (10%). The latent heat flux was the main consumer of the available energy during the rainy season (71%), while sensible heat flux was dominant during the dry season (77%). In terms of the rainy season water balance, 1229 mm of rainfall was observed in 2003, of which 351 mm evaporated, white 825 mm of rainfall was observed in 2004, of which 268 mm evaporated. During the dry season, the latent heat flux was strongly coupled to the atmosphere, with the decoupling coefficient (0) ranging from 0.18 to 0.4. These tow values were due to tow soil moisture availability and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD > 4 kPa). During the rainy season, the latent heat flux was decoupled from the atmosphere (0.6 <= Omega < 0.9). Following this pattern of coupling and decoupling, a new formulation of actual evaporation and surface conductance was proposed. The results are thought to be relevant inputs for eco-hydrological models in the semi-arid region of West Africa. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, DREAM((ZS)), Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis combined with both formal and informal likelihood functions, is used to investigate uncertainty of parameters of the HEC-HMS model in Tamar watershed, Golestan province, Iran.
   In order to assess the uncertainty of 24 parameters used in HMS, three flood events were used to calibrate and one flood event was used to validate the posterior distributions. Moreover, performance of seven different likelihood functions (L1-L7) was assessed by means of DREAM((zs))approach. Four likelihood functions, L1-L4, Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency, Normalized absolute error (NAE), Index of agreement (IDA), and Chiew-McMahon efficiency (CM), is considered as informal, whereas remaining (L5-L7) is represented in formal category. L5 focuses on the relationship between the traditional least squares fitting and the Bayesian inference, and L6, is a hetereoscedastic maximum likelihood error (HMLE) estimator. Finally, in likelihood function L7, serial dependence of residual errors is accounted using a first-order autoregressive (AR) model of the residuals.
   According to the results, sensitivities of the parameters strongly depend on the likelihood function, and vary for different likelihood functions. Most of the parameters were better defined by formal likelihood functions L5 and L7 and showed a high sensitivity to model performance. Posterior cumulative distributions corresponding to the informal likelihood functions L1, L2, 13, L4 and the formal likelihood function L6 are approximately the same for most of the sub-basins, and these likelihood functions depict almost a similar effect on sensitivity of parameters. 95% total prediction uncertainty bounds bracketed most of the observed data. Considering all the statistical indicators and criteria of uncertainty assessment, including RMSE, KGE, NS, P-factor and R-factor, results showed that DREAM((ZS)) algorithm performed better under formal likelihood functions L5 and L7, but likelihood function L5 may result in biased and unreliable estimation of parameters due to violation of the residualerror assumptions. Thus, likelihood function L7 provides posterior distribution of model parameters credibly and therefore can be employed for further applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Brisbane River estuary (BRE) in Australia not only plays a vital role in ecosystem health, but is also of importance for people who live nearby. Comprehensive investigations, both in the short- and long-term, into the salinity and turbidity distributions in the BRE were conducted. Firstly, the analysis of numerical results revealed that the longitudinal salinity varied at approximately 0.45 and 0.61 psu/h during neap and spring tides, respectively. The turbidity stayed at a higher level and was less impacted by tide in the upper estuary, however, the water cleared up while the tide changed from flood to ebb in the mid and lower estuary. The second investigation into the seasonal variations of salinity and turbidity in the BRE was conducted, using ten-year field measurement data. A fourth-order polynomial equation was proposed, describing the longitudinal variation in salinity dilution changes as the upstream distance in the BRE during the wet and dry seasons. From the observation, the mid and upper estuaries were vertically well-mixed during both seasons, but the lower BRE was stratified, particularly during the wet season. The estuary turbidity maximum (ETM) zone was about 10 km longer during the wet season than the dry season. Particular emphasis was given to the third investigation into the use of satellite remote sensing techniques for estimation of the turbidity level in the BRE. A linear relationship between satellite observed water reflectance and surface turbidity level in the BRE was validated with an R-2 of 0.75. The application of satellite-observed water reflectance therefore provided a practical solution for estimating surface turbidity levels of estuarine rivers not only under normal weather conditions, but also during flood events. The results acquired from this study are valuable for further hydrological research in the BRE and particularly prominent for immediate assessment of flood impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The US Midwest is an important area of first generation biofuels, accounting for 80-90% of US corn and soybean production (2009-2011). However, there are potential adverse impacts of biofuel production on water resources in this area. The objective of this study was to assess potential impacts of biofuel production on water resources by exploring relationships between hydrologic changes and climate and land surface changes based on long-term (similar to 1930s-2010) stream gage and climate data from 55 unregulated watersheds in the US Midwest. Long-term trends in climate (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) and flow were evaluated. Sensitivity of changes in annual streamflow and baseflow to climate was evaluated using climate elasticity (sensitivity) and the residuals were attributed to land surface changes. Results show that streamflow increased significantly (p < 0.05) in 35% (19/55) of watersheds (median 2.4 +/- 0.3 mm/year), baseflow increased in 58% of watersheds (median 1.1 +/- 0.4 mm/year), and baseflow index (baseflow/streamflow, BFI) increased in 42% of watersheds (median 0.2 +/- 0.1%/year). Overall, climatic variability contributed more than land surface change to streamflow change (61 +/- 19% vs. 40 +/- 18%), while land surface change contributed much more to baseflow (74 +/- 10% vs. 27 +/- 10%; 2.7 times higher) and to BFI (119 +/- 14% vs. 27 +/- 18%; 4.4 times higher) than climate change. Watersheds (25/55, 45%) with no significant trend in climate but with significant flow trends provide direct evidence that the Midwest land surface change (cropping system and related land management) significantly impacted flow processes. Restricting analysis to these watersheds shows that land surface change contributed 2.0 times more than climate variability/change to streamflow change, 3.2 times more to baseflow change, and 7.7 times more to BFI change. The importance of past land surface changes on hydrology suggests that any future land surface changes, such as biofuel expansion or changing biofuel feedstocks, should consider impacts on the hydrology.

AB In recent years, many ecological parks have been constructed in the pen-urban areas of Chinese cities to relieve the ecological pressure of high-speed urbanization. Compared with the natural landscape, the artificial ecological park is totally a man-regulated system, which is fragile and very sensitive to the runoff and sediment disturbance from severe storms. Thus, a case study was performed in the artificially constructed Beijing Olympic Forest Park to study its hydrological response to severe storms and to identify the critical areas for implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs). The monitored rainfall-runoff data revealed that infiltration excess runoff was the predominant runoff generation mechanism in the study area. A Dynamic Watershed Simulation Model (DWSM) was used to simulate the runoff and sediment transport processes from monitored and design storms. Owing to the complexity of topography and Jack of a single outlet, the DWSM was calibrated and validated in a typical hillslope with a nested structure to acquire scale appropriate parameters. Then, the DWSM was applied to other overland segments and scaled consistently to perform scenario analysis under design storm conditions. Results showed that, the shift of rainfall intensity in design storms could produce amplified hydrologic responses, but had little impact on the overland rankings based on runoff depth or specific sediment yield. However, the different spatial patterns between runoff and sediment revealed the spatially varied soil erosion processes (transport-limited or supply-limited) and the necessity of site-specific BMPs. Generally, the areas with high runoff and sediment potentials were mostly related to the segments with small drainage areas and short, steep slopes, while the constructed drainage system could function as interception BMPs to reduce runoff and sediment discharges. The analysis of the relationship between overland rankings and overland features could provide guidance to identify critical areas and to implement site-specific BMPs in pen-urban artificial landscapes.

AB Environmental tracers CFCs, O-18, H-2 and tritium were used to determine the natural groundwater recharge and the impact of irrigation activity on the groundwater system in the semi-arid Zhangye Basin of China. Groundwaters in the irrigated areas have been identified as mixtures containing fractions recharged in different periods of time. The CFC and H-3 data show that the oldest fraction in the groundwater was recharged before 1950, whereas the younger fractions were recharged in different periods of time since 1950. Stable isotope (O-18, H-2), CFC and electrical conductivity data show that most of the samples can be regarded as binary mixtures with the river/irrigation water presents the younger fraction and the regional groundwater presents the older fraction. Binary mixing model is used to estimate the age and fraction of the younger component. Most of the younger fraction was recharged after 1980s. in response to the increasing irrigation activities. Compared to local precipitation surface water plays a major role in recharging the aquifer in the irrigated area. The irrigation activity had more impact on the aquifer under thin unsaturated zone (<10 m), due to short travel times and high amounts of recharge, whereas it had less impact on the aquifer under thick unsaturated zone (tens of meters). CFCs are useful in identifying regions of different impact of irrigation return flow. The positive correlation between nitrate and CFC data show that contaminants are transported to the saturated zone by irrigation water. This study shows that in this semi-arid basin due to strong evaporation of infiltrating surface water and regional groundwater, delta O-18 and EC values, in contrast to CFCs, do not show simple relationship with NO; concentration in groundwater. Combined with a proper mixing model, however, they can provide evidences that the CFCs found in groundwater were introduced by infiltrating irrigation return flow and, therefore, reveal that human activities can produce a much localized water circulation and influence groundwater vulnerability.

TI Smoothing the seasonal means of rainfall and runoff in the linear
   perturbation model (LPM) using the kernel estimator
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE linear perturbation model (LPM); seasonal means; smoothing; kernel
   estimator; rainfall-runoff modelling
AB As many natural catchments exhibit a significant or even marked degree of seasonality in their rainfall and runoff data, the means of identification of the seasonality structure and the determination of a quantitative expression or index of seasonality are topics of considerable interest to hydrologists. In a rainfall-runoff model such as the linear perturbation model (LPM), which explicitly takes into account the seasonality of daily data by identifying, smoothing, and subsequently abstracting the smoothed seasonal means of daily rainfall and runoff data, it is also of interest to examine how its efficiency in simulating the rainfall-runoff relationship of a catchment is affected by the smoothing method used. In the standard version of the LPM, the discrete Fourier smoothing method is employed to remove the high-frequency fluctuations of the seasonal means obtained from records of observed daily rainfall and runoff data of necessarily limited length. In the present study, the kernel estimator, which is a widely used non-parametric regression method, is employed as a simpler alternative to Fourier smoothing. Testing the LPM, using both smoothing methods, on three catchments and comparing its results, it is found that both smoothing methods achieve virtually the same results in terms of the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency index R-2. To quantify the relative significance of the seasonal component in the simulated runoff series, a seasonality index (SI) is proposed. It is observed that the performance of the LPM is influenced much more by the seasonal characteristics of the rainfall and runoff processes in a catchment, as expressed by the proposed seasonality index SI, than by the methods used to smoothen the seasonal means. Clearly, for those catchments characterized by strong seasonality, thereby satisfying the design assumption of the model, the LPM can be expected to perform satisfactorily, much better than on catchments having weak seasonality.

AB It is crucial to investigate how a precipitation deficit is transformed into hydrological drought and how climate change and human activities affect this transformation process, which is helpful to gain a deep understanding of drought propagation process in this changing environment. This study proposed an observation-based natural and human-impacted catchment comparison method to assess the impacts of climate change and human activities on propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought. The method mainly consists of the following three steps: (1) selection of natural catchments through analysis of trends and change points of hydrometeorological data, as well as statistics analysis of human influence based on land use and socio-economic indicators data sets; (2) calculation of drought propagation characteristics (e.g., drought severity, duration, and propagation time) based on run theory and the Pearson correlation coefficient; and (3) comparison of drought propagation characteristics of natural catchments between undisturbed and disturbed periods to identify the impacts of climate change on drought propagation, and comparison of the propagation characteristics between natural and human-impacted catchments during the disturbed period to investigate human influence on drought propagation. The Laohahe basin (with eleven sub-catchments), located in northern China, was evaluated via the proposed procedure, and standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized runoff index (SRI) were used to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable tool for distinguishing natural and human-impacted catchments, and separating the impacts of climate change and human activities on drought propagation. Furthermore, the comparison results of different schemes show that climate change accelerates the propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought in the Laohahe basin, shortening it by approximately 3 months. Human activities, however, disturb and then delay the natural propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought, retarding it by 11-12 months. Although the Laohahe basin was selected as a case study in this paper, the proposed method can be applied in other regions as well to improve drought prediction and water resources management.

AB Evaporation from porous media in the presence of dissolved salts is an important topic in relation to several environmental issues. In this study, we investigated the interaction of evaporation, salt crystallization and the internal structure of the porous material. Porous columns with different internal structures were generated through random packing of angular quartz sand and round glass beads. Evaporation-induced salt efflorescence on the surface of porous media was recorded by a camera with micro lens. The internal pore structure before and after salt crystallization was visualized using the x-ray computed tomography and quantified by the extracted pore networks. Hydraulic properties in the absence/presence of salt crystals were simulated numerically using the pore-network approach and partially measured experimentally. The evaporative water loss ratio in the angular quartz sand was greater than that in the glass beads with the same sieving size. The evaporation of saline water in angular quartz sand and round glass beads can be separated into three stages similar to water evaporation. Salt efflorescence was generated a crust dome architecture on the surface of the angular sand, but was in tight patchy contact with the round glass beads. The presence of salt crust interrupted the exchange of vapor between the porous media and atmosphere, hindering evaporation. Salt subflorescence clogged some of the pores, and the pore size distribution shifted to smaller sizes part. The porosity decreased and the geometric tortuosity of the porous materials increased owing to salt subflorescence. The presence of subflorescence salt crystals decreased the intrinsic permeability and relative diffusion coefficient of different porous media. The relationship between the vapor diffusion coefficients and porosity is linear in the presence/absence of salt crystallization, considering the geometric tortuosity. The findings indicate that the feedback of salt precipitation on hydraulic properties and vapor diffusion must be considered to accurately quantify hydrological processes, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas where intensive evaporation is accompanied by soil salinization and water shortage.

AB Methods for predicting streamflow in areas with limited or nonexistent measures of hydrologic response commonly rely on regionalization techniques, where knowledge pertaining to gauged watersheds is transferred to ungauged watersheds. Hydrologic response indices have frequently been employed in contemporary regionalization research related to predictions in ungauged basins. In this study, we developed regionalization models using multiple linear regression and regression tree analysis to derive relationships between hydrologic response and watershed physical characteristics for 163 watersheds in the Great Lakes basin. These models provide an empirical means for simulating runoff in ungauged basins at a monthly time step without implementation of a rainfall-runoff model. For the dependent variable in these regression models, we used monthly runoff ratio as the indicator of hydrologic response and defined it at two temporal scales: (1) treating all monthly runoff ratios as individual observations, and (2) using the mean of these monthly runoff ratios for each watershed as a representative observation. Application of the models to 62 validation watersheds throughout the Great Lakes basin indicated that model simulations were far more sensitive to the temporal characterization of hydrologic response than to the type of regression technique employed, and that models conditioned on individual monthly runoff ratios (rather than long term mean values) performed better. This finding is important in light of the increased usage of hydrologic response indices in recent regionalization studies. Models using individual observations for the dependent variable generally simulated monthly runoff with reasonable skill in the validation watersheds (median Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.53, median R-2 = 0.66, median magnitude of the deviation of runoff volume = 13%). These results suggest the viability of empirical approaches to simulate runoff in ungauged basins. This finding is significant given the many regions of the world with sparse gauging networks and limited resources for gathering the field data required to calibrate rainfall-runoff models.

The Florida Everglades is a highly managed and extensive subtropical wetland that exerts a substantial influence on the hydrology and climate of the south Florida region. However, the effects of seasonality and active water management on energy balance in the Everglades ecosystem are poorly understood. An eddy covariance and micrometeorological tower was established in a short-hydroperiod Everglades marsh to examine the dominant environmental controls on sensible heat (H) and latent energy (LE) fluxes, as well as the effects of seasonality on these parameters. Seasonality differentially affected H and LE fluxes in this marsh, such that H was principally dominant in the dry season and LE was strongly dominant in the wet season. The Bowen ratio was high for much of the dry season (1.5-2.4), but relatively low (<0.7) in the wet season. Net radiation strongly influenced H and LE fluxes across nearly all seasons and years (R-adj(2) = 0.48 - 0.79). However, the 2009 dry season LE data were not consistent with this relationship (R-adj(2) = 0.08) because of low seasonal variation in LE following a prolonged end to the previous wet season. In addition to net radiation, H and LE fluxes were significantly related to soil volumetric water content (VWC), water depth, air temperature, and occasionally vapor pressure deficit. Given that VWC and water depth were determined in part by water management decisions, it is clear that human actions have the ability to influence the mode of energy dissipation from this ecosystem. Impending modifications to water management under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan may shift the dominant turbulent flux from this ecosystem further toward LE, and this change will likely affect local hydrology and climate.

AB The effect of distance-decay on nutrient flux usually plays an important role in nutrient retention from non-point sources to surface waters. However, the distance-decay effect has been inappropriately neglected in many studies that adopted regression modeling method to quantify the relationship between watershed landscape and in-stream nutrient loading level. The goal of this study was to develop non-linear regression models that better quantify the role of distance on non-point source nutrient loads in rivers by using simulation results of a spatially-explicit model applied to the watersheds in the Upper Chattahoochee River Basin, Georgia. Because a detailed spatially-explicit modeling approach typically simulates the nutrient flux across the entire watershed, it provides opportunities to examine the nutrient decay patterns at watershed scale. The simulation results confirmed that regarding the effect of flow distance on nutrient loading, the exponential decay setting in the spatially-explicit model performs well. Other heterogeneous factors including slope and soil conditions do affect the decay results but not strongly enough to change the general exponential patterns. The nutrient contribution from areas that were greater than 300 meters to the river network was negligible. It was also found that the decay rate for urban lands is lower than that for other land-covers. Based on these findings, a spatial aggregation strategy in the lateral dimension of the river network was adopted and eight non-linear regression models which explicitly addressed the effects of distance-decay were designed to estimate the nutrient annual average loads. The model validation results showed that three of them can well estimate the nutrient loads. This study shows the usage of stream-lateral-dimension aggregation strategy in addressing nutrient distance-decay patterns and developing simple regression models of nutrient loading. This study also illustrates the advantages of using comprehensive spatially-explicit models to design and configure simpler regression models for improving our understanding of nutrient export from land to water.

AB Concern has been expressed regarding the impacts of climate change on freshwater aquatic ecosystems in arctic regions. Populated with lakes controlled by flooding from spring break-up ice jams, arctic deltas such as the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada are particularly sensitive to changing ice break-up conditions and the hydroclimatic controls on break-up and ice-jam flooding. An understanding of these controls is necessary for assessing future climate change effects. This paper presents an assessment of hydroclimatic conditions controlling break-up over the period 1974-2006, with a focus on extreme flood events. Both the upstream driving force, capturing elements of the spring discharge hydrograph, and the downstream resistance force, describing the competence of the downstream ice cover, were quantified with reference to the Mackenzie River at Arctic Red River hydrometric station such that the contribution of each to the severity and timing of break-up could be explored. Results show that the severity of peak break-up stage is most influenced by upstream discharge and the balance between upstream and downstream melt, while timing is related to delta ice conditions and the rise of the spring hydrograph. The highest peak stage events require a rapid rise in discharge and high peak discharge. Minimal downstream melting degree-days and greater ice thickness are also important, although no relationship of these appears to control the level of backwater produced from broken ice and ice jamming effects. The pattern of rapid (protracted) upstream melt and lower (higher) intensity melt in the delta characterizes the highest (lowest) break-up events. For the most severe events, upstream forces are important in controlling discharge-driven events, while an altered hydrologic response occurring for ice-driven events was noted, meriting future examination. Finally, trends toward a longer prebreak-up melt interval, lower peak discharge, rate of rise in discharge, and ice thickness, and higher freeze-up stage were observed, with greater variability of these controls and break-up severity in the most recent decade.

AB Along with gradually controlled point source discharges, diffuse nitrogen pollution has become an important cause of eutrophication. Diffuse nitrogen export from forests is an inherent characteristic, and increasing human disturbance aggravates this process. To control diffuse nitrogen pollution effectively, it is of great significance to determine the source, transport path and removal method of diffuse nitrogen export in forest-dominated watersheds. Long-term variations in the nitrogen concentrations indicate that nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are the main diffuse nitrogen export forms in the Buerhatong River watershed (BRW). Thus, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model is conducted to simulate diffuse nitrate and DON export. First, main source of diffuse nitrate and DON export is determined by the fitting results of nitrogen contribution and forest/farmland cover. Then, the relationship between nitrogen export from forest/farmland and main hydrologic streamflow is explored. Finally, the role of wetlands in the diffuse nitrogen load removal is analyzed, and sensitivity results by Monte Carlo simulation of nitrogen export from wetlands, forests and farmlands are compared. The average annual diffuse nitrate and DON export values are 1.19 and 0.43 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, from 2014 to 2017. When forest cover and farmland cover are higher than 70% and 5%, farmlands and forests are the main sources of diffuse nitrate and DON export, respectively. Lateral flow is the dominant transport path of DON export from forests and nitrate export from farmlands, with correlation coefficient of 0.73 and proportion of 98%, respectively. Wetlands have the ability to reduce the diffuse nitrogen load, and their efficiency is related to the relative geographic location. The in situ experimental results show that the nitrate and DON removal rates by wetlands are 24.46% and 11.71%, respectively. The sensitivity of forest and wetland for diffuse nitrate and DON load removal is 0.31, - 0.12 and 0.2, - 0.21, respectively. Returning forests to wetlands is a good method for diffuse nitrogen removal with food production taken into consideration.

AB Identification of thresholds associated with key climate, catchment and morphological variables for hydrological droughts can further improve our understanding of evolution and propagation of droughts in a complex water resource system. These thresholds are associated with complex interaction between climate and catchment variables and they are often connected through hierarchical as well as non-linear relationships. The advantage of selecting a multi-factor predictor domain can detect multiple thresholds that may not be observed by analyses limited to single predictors. In the present study, we developed a conceptual modeling framework by integrating a hydrological model developed based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and statistical models to quantify the potential influence of climate, catchment, and morphological variables and their thresholds on hydrological drought duration and severity for the watersheds located in Savannah River Basin (SRB). The concept of standardized runoff index (SRI) was used to derive the multiscale hydrological drought time series (i.e., SRI 1, SRI 6, and SRI 12) to investigate short term, medium term, and long term drought events based on their duration and severity. It was observed that the linear models developed based on the climate variables may not be capable for predicting the duration of multiscale hydrological droughts, whereas, the performance of statistical models can be significantly improved by the addition of catchment and morphological variables. In addition, among the morphological variables stream order seems to have a significant control over short, medium and long term drought duration across the study area. In the second phase of our analysis, we employed classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm for quantifying the thresholds associated with climate, catchment, and morphological variables that have potential influence on the hydrological drought. The result indicates that the variables and its associated threshold vary for short, medium, and long term drought. The proposed modeling framework can be extended for ungauged basins to improve the drought management.

AB The Xijiang River is known as the Golden Watercourse because of its role in the development of the Pearl River Delta Regional Economic System in China, which was made possible by its abundant water resources. At present, the hydrological regime of the Xijiang River has now become complicated, the water shortages and successive droughts pose a threat to regional economic development. However, the complexity of hydroclimatological processes with emphasizes on drought has not been comprehended. In order to effectively predict and develop the adaptation strategies to cope with the water scarcity damage caused by hydrological droughts, it is essential to thoroughly analyze the relationship between hydrological droughts and pre/post-dependent hydroclimatological factors. To accomplish this, the extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition method (ESMD) was utilized to reveal the periodic variation in hydrological droughts that is characterized by the Standardized Drought Index (SDI). In addition, the cross-wavelet transform method was applied to investigate the correlation between large-scale climate indices and drought. The results showed that hydrological drought had the most significant response to spring ENSO (El Nifio-Southern Oscillation), and the response lags in sub-basins were mostly 8-9 months except that in Yujiang River were mainly 5 or 8 months. Signal reservoir operation in the Yujiang River reduced drought severity by 52-95.8% from January to April over the 2003-2014 time period. Similarly, the cascade reservoir alleviated winter and spring droughts in the Hongshuihe River Basin. However, autumn drought was aggravated with severity increased by 41.9% in September and by 160.9% in October, so that the land surface models without considering human intervention must be used with caution in the hydrological simulation. The response lags of the VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) to hydrological drought were different in the sub-basins. The response lag for the Hongshuihe, Yujiang, and Liujiang River Basins were mostly 0-4 months, 0-1 months, and 2-3 months, respectively, but there was no obvious regular change pattern in the Guijiang River Basin.

AB Weekly variation of delta O-18 was measured over 2 years in precipitation and river water in four relatively large catchments in north east Scotland. The River Dee (1712 km(2)) is predominantly upland, with impermeable geology and hydrologically responsive soils. The headwaters of the River North Esk (732 km(2)) are similar, but the lower third of the catchment is underlain by a major sandstone aquifer and is lowland (i.e. < 300 m altitude) in nature. The upper 20% of the River Don catchment (1273 km(2)) is upland, but the remainder is lowland with freely draining soils recharging significant groundwater reservoirs in superficial drifts. The River Ythan catchment (662 km(2)) is entirely lowland and similar to the lower Don. The hydrological responsiveness of the catchments was directly related to their upland area, with the Dee and the North Esk generating the highest specific discharges during high flow events. Conversely, the Don and Ythan had more subdued hydrological regimes, but higher specific discharge under baseflows. Despite broadly similar delta O-18 variation in precipitation inputs, the variability of stream waters was increasingly damped in the order Ythan > Don > North Esk > Dee. Convolution integral models were used to estimate Mean Transit Times (MTTs) for the four catchments from the isotope data. These were reasonably well-constrained at around 2 years for the Dee and 3 years for the North Esk. Estimates for the Don and Ythan were poorly constrained and therefore highly uncertain, but are both likely to exceed 10 years. MTTs in upland catchments in the Scottish Highlands are relatively short (ca. 2 months-4 years) and have been shown to be strongly correlated with soil hydrology, topographic indices and precipitation intensity. However, these relationships change in lowland areas as catchments become less surface water dominated and greater groundwater storage and deeper mixing processes result in much higher MTTs. Nevertheless, a close correlation between soil cover and MTT remains. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sapflow measurements were carried out in a larch forest in eastern Siberia, an area of wide permafrost distribution. Canopy transpiration and canopy conductance were scaled up from these values. The objective was to analyze the relationship between environmental variables, mainly vapour pressure deficit (D), soil moisture and soil, thawing rate with canopy transpiration and canopy conductance. Maximum sapflow rate was 42.4 kg d(-1) tree(-1) with bigger trees showing a more accentuated response to environmental changes. Canopy transpiration (E-c) showed inter-annual variability, with a maximum value of 1.7 mm d(-1) in 2003 and 1.2 mm d(-1) in 2004. Soil moisture was higher in 2003 because of higher precipitation (230 mm in 2003 compared to 110 mm in 2004 for the total growing season). Maximum soil thawing rate in 2003 and 2004 was 140 cm and 120 cm, respectively, because of different air temperature, soil water content and precipitation regime among other factors. Canopy conductance (g(c)) was positively correlated with D during fine weather and well-watered days in both years. On the other hand, canopy conductance was well correlated with soil moisture (R-2 = 0.83) in the upper layers (20-30 cm depth) during 2003 (wet year) but not in 2004 (dry year), representing its strong but limited control over water fluxes from the forest. By comparison with other studies in this region, canopy transpiration is estimated to contribute to almost 50% of the total forest evaporation, highlighting the important role of understorey transpiration in permafrost regions. Our results show that it is not only the impermeability of permafrost with the property of keeping soil moisture in the thin active layer but it is also the slow soil thawing rate that plays the important role of controlling the amount of water available for trees roots in the upper soil layers during dry years.

TI Errors in remote sensing of intercepted photosynthetically active
   radiation: An example from HAPEX-Sahel
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID VEGETATION INDEX; MODEL; REFLECTANCE; SATELLITE
AB Canopy PAR interception (IPAR) is an important variable in many models of canopy photosynthesis and net primary production. IPAR can be estimated remotely using spectral vegetation indices (VI). However, IPAR estimates by this method are subject to errors (E) associated with (i) the estimation of fractional interception (f(PAR)) from a VI measurement (E-F), (ii) the accuracy of estimates of incident PAR (E-T) and (iii) the interaction of these errors (E-X). During the HAPEX-Sahel experiment in Niger in 1991 the temporal evolution of a VI was measured over the study sites with a radiometer mounted in a light aircraft. Ground measurements of f(PAR) and incident PAB on HAPEX West Central shrub fallow, grass fallow, degraded shrub fallow and millet sites were available. The f(PAR) measurements were used to determine the relationship between the VI and fractional interception. The aircraft measurements were then used. together with remote estimates of incident PAR from the TOMS satellite. to estimate IPAR through the season and to quantify the error sources. Both E-F and E-T can result in large absolute and relative errors in IPAR estimates, E-X was generally small. In ten-day summations on the shrub and grass fallow sites, the total errors were mostly less than 20% of the round measurements. On the millet and degraded shrub fallow, the ten-day errors were more substantial. The errors at short time steps (1-10 days) cancel when summed for the whole growing season.
   In applications where the precise daily errors in IPAR estimates cannot be quantified, the statistical uncertainty of the estimates can be evaluated if the uncertainty in the input variables is known. The standard error of IPAR estimates is then dependent on the residual variance in the regression between vegetation index and f(PAR) and on the mean square error of the remote estimates of incident PAR.

AB Cascade damming has seriously affected the hydrologic regimes and solutes transport of the river systems. However, the effect of damming on carbon cycle and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, to reveal the effects of damming on riverine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) transport, the water chemistry and stable isotopic signature of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-1(3)Dic) were analyzed in the tributaries and four subtropical karst reservoirs on the Pearl River in southern China. From reservoir epilimnion to hypolimnion, DIC concentrations increased from 183.2 to 229.4 mg L-1, 167.6 to 192.0 mg L-1, 179.1 to 181.5 mg L-1, and 182.4 to 183.8 mg L(-1 )while delta C-1(3) mc decreased from -6.6 parts per thousand to -9.7 parts per thousand, -7.8 parts per thousand to -10.4 parts per thousand, -9.7 parts per thousand to -10.0 parts per thousand and - 9.9 parts per thousand to -10.0 parts per thousand in the Chaishitan (CST), Longtan (LT), Yantan (YT), and Dahua (DH) reservoirs, respectively. Our analyses suggest that primary production and organic matter degradation were two dominant processes in carbon evolution in the epilimnion and hypolimnion, respectively. However, there was no obvious spatial heterogeneity of solutes' concentration in the DH reservoir. Our results also suggested that cascade reservoirs had a regional damming effect and could be significantly weakened without damming or in daily regulated reservoirs. Furthermore, delta(1)(3)C(DIC )had a significant positive relationship with the reservoir effect index (Ri), which was affected by hydraulic retention time and water temperature in the water column of reservoirs and is useful to evaluate the thermal stratification strength. This study highlights that dam constructions affected carbon transport and transformation significantly, and the degree of the damming effect on the carbon cycle can be expressed by Ri.

AB The phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) 3D fluorescent signatures were appointed to elaborate arsenic (As) mobilization mechanism in groundwater from the Datong Basin. Groundwater samples were collected along the groundwater flow path from recharge zones to discharge zones according to redox sensitive parameters. Variations of Eh, NO3- and SO42- manifested the redox condition shifted from a weakly oxidative environment to highly reductive environment. In recharge zones, some aerobic bacteria may serve as the dominant species, such as Thiothrbc (S-oxidizing bacteria: SOB), Gallionella (Fe-oxidizing bacteria: FeOB) and Fluviicola, characterized by 16:1 omega 7, 16:0 and 18:1 omega 7 PLFAs. The biogeochemical processes were mainly governed by aerobic bacteria exploiting protein-like DOM as electron donors to maintain metabolism together with depleting of O-2 and NO3- (electron acceptors), which restricted the reduction of As. While in discharge zones, the anaerobic microbes played a predominant role, such as Desulfosporosinus (Sulfate reducing bacteria: SRB) and Clostridia (Fe reducing bacteria: FeRB), indicated by cy17:0, cy19:0 and 18:1 omega 9 PLFAs. SRB and FeRB mainly utilized protein-like DOM as energy sources for respiratory action. Simultaneously, biogenic reductive dissolution of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides and reduction of As(V), SO42- resulted in geogenic immobilized As reductive desorption into aquifers. The positive linear correlations between humic substances and Fe, As suggested that As-Fe-DOM complexation can enhance the transport of As and Fe in aqueous environments. The negative relationships between SRB/FeRB and As/Fe concentrations demonstrated that the HS- could react with Fe(II) and As(III) to form secondary Fe(II) sulfides or As-bearing sulfides, which subsequently sequestered As from groundwater via sorption or coprecipitation. In conclusion, the utilization of biodegradable protein-like DOM by SRB/FeRB being associated with reductive dissolution of As-bearing Fe (hydr)oxides minerals and AsFe-DOM complexation promoted As mobility in groundwater aquifers.

AB Soil moisture is a variable of paramount importance for a number of natural processes and requires the capacity to be routinely measured at different spatial and temporal scales (e.g., hillslope and/or small catchment scale). The electromagnetic induction (EMI) method is one of the geophysical techniques potentially useful in this regard. Indeed, it does not require contact with the ground, it allows a relatively fast survey of hillslope, it gives information related to soil depth greater than few centimetres and it can also be used in wooded areas. In this study, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and soil moisture (SM) measurements were jointly carried out by using a multi-frequency EMI sensor (GEM-300) and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probes, respectively. The aim was to retrieve SM variations at the hillslope scale over four sites, characterized by different land-soil units, located in a small mountainous catchment in southern Italy. Repeated measurements of ECa carried out over a fixed point showed that the signal variability of the GEM-300 sensor (Std. Err. similar to[0.02-0.1 ms/m]) was negligible. The correlation estimated between point ECa and SM, measured with both portable and buried TDR probes, varied between 0.24 and 0.58, depending on the site considered. In order to reduce the effect of small-scale variability, a spatial smoothing filter was applied which allowed the estimation of linear relationships with higher coefficient of correlation (r similar to 0.46-0.8). The accuracy obtained in the estimation of the temporal trend of the soil moisture spatial averages was in the range similar to 4.5-7.8% v/v and up to the similar to 70% of the point soil moisture variance was explained by the ECa signal. The obtained results highlighted the potential of EMI to provide, in a short time, sufficiently accurate estimate of soil moisture over large areas that are highly needed for hydrological and remote sensing applications.

AB A better knowledge of dripwater hydrology in karst systems is needed to understand the palaeoclimate implications of temporal variations in Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca of calcareous cave deposits. Quantitative modelling of drip hydrology and hydrochemistry was undertaken at a disused limestone mine (Brown's Folly Mine) in SW England overlain by 15 m of poorly karstified Jurassic limestones, with sub-vertical fracturing enhanced by proximity to an escarpment. Discharge was monitored at 15 sites intermittently from the beginning of 1996, and every 10-20 days from later 1996 to early 1998. Samples for hydrochemical parameters (pH, alkalinity, cations, anions, fluorescence) were taken corresponding to a sub-set of these data and supplernented by bedrock and soil sampling, limited continuously logged discharge, and soil water observations. Three sites, covering the range of discharge (approximately 1 mu L s(-1) to 1 ml s(-1) maximum discharge) and hydrochemical behaviours, were studied in more detail. A quantitative flow model was constructed, based on two parallel unit hydrographs: responsive and relatively unresponsive to discharge events, respectively. The linear response and conservative mixing assumptions of the model were tested with hydrogeochemical data.
   Dripwaters at many of sites are characterized by evidence of prior calcite precipitation in the flowpath above the mine, which in the higher discharging sites diminishes at high flow. Also at low flow rates, dripwaters may access seepage reservoirs enriched in Mg and/or Sr, dependent on the site. The discharge at all three sites can be approximated by the flow model, but in each case, hydrochemical data show violations of the model assumptions. All sites show evidence of non-conservative mixing, and there are temporal discontinuities in behaviour, which may be stimulated by airlocks generated at low flow. Enhanced Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca often do relate to low-flow conditions, but the relationships between climate and hydrogeochemical response are non-linear. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Concerns about climate change are amplifying interest in future rainfall extremes. However, there are big differences between the statistics of rainfall extremes obtained using future rainfall time series produced from various climate models. Such large uncertainties create a la of confusion in establishing climate change adaptation measures. Looking at future rainfall extremes at a particular site yields increasing trends in some climate models and decreasing trends in others. The spatial patterns of rate of change in rainfall extremes also vary widely, depending on the climate model. As a result, they often do not gain the public's trust. We believe that this difficulty in obtaining credibility does not come from a lack of theory or technique, but from an approach that persuades the public of uncertain future rainfall extremes. In this study, we employed a novel approach to integrate a co-variate of the not-stationary Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) - Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) model identified at each site with its future projection information for obtaining future rainfall extreme ensembles. Rainfall extremes are obtained from the observed rainfall time series using the POT method, and the scale parameter among GPD parameters are applied as a function of surface air temperature (SAT) or dew-point temperature (DPT). M this time, the threshold of the POT series is set to match the results of frequency analysis of the annual maximum series and the POT series for each site as much as possible. The behavior of future rainfall extremes is analyzed by inputting the future SAT or DAT produced from various climate models into the non-stationary frequency model using the co-variate. As a result of comparing the rainfall extremes obtained using the future rainfall time series directly with the future rainfall extremes obtained indirectly using the proposed method, it was found that the proposed approach projected future design rainfall depths with much less variation between climate models. The spatial pattern of rate of change was also consistent regardless of climate model. The proposed method is expected to contribute to the public's confidence in future rainfall extremes under climate change scenarios and to be of practical help in formulating reasonable climate change adaptation policies.

TI Reconstruction of daily rainfall data using the concepts of networks:
   Accounting for spatial connections in neighborhood selection

AB Accurate and reliable rainfall data is one of the fundamental prerequisites in hydrological modelling. The rainfall data at a desired location can be reconstructed using interpolation methods, such as Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), which is frequently used in hydrology. In standard IDW neighbors are selected based on geographical proximity or nearest neighbor (IDW_NN). However, in a basin with variable topography, nearby rain gauges may be located at very different elevations and, thus, they may not accurately represent the spatial connection in rainfall. In this work, the theory of networks, with nodes and links as the basis, is applied to select neighbors while applying IDW. Two variants of neighbor selection models are proposed: IDW with linked neighbours (IDW_LN) and IDW with clustered neighbors (IDW_CN). For reconstruction, thirty years of daily rainfall data from 430 rain gauges in Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) are utilized. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, one-station-leave-out cross validation approach is used and the associated Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) and Bias-percentage (BP) are calculated. Different values of number of neighbors (n), Correlation Threshold (CT) and Clustering Coefficient Range (CCR) are used to measure the errors associated with the proposed models. On comparing with IDW_NN, results show that reconstruction using IDW_LN has lower RMSE at about 30 percent of stations and lower BP for about 50 percent of stations; while EDW_CN shows lower RMSE at about 25 percent of stations and lower BP for about 45 percent of stations. The IDW_NN performed better than IDW_LN and IDW_CN at more than 50 percent of stations though the average error associated with all the three models are comparable for all CT values. In a natural system, a concept like traditional IDW (IDW_NN) may be more accurate than the network-based approach (IDW_LN and IDW_CN) but may not be completely efficient in accounting the spatial rainfall variability. The encouraging results for the reconstruction of rainfall in this study seem to indicate that the approach can be further helpful in the reconstruction of a wide range of meteorological parameters with spatial correlation.

AB The accurate quantification of lake volume is essential for regional water resources management and ecosystem health. Because of the high cost of traditional full-lake depth measurements, the bathymetric and volume in-formation for most lakes globally is inaccessible. Whether the limited field measurements over the lake can be used to estimate lake volume is worth investigating. This study aims to propose an effective method for esti-mating lake mean depth/volume based on the lake deepest record. We first constructed the empirical model that relies on the linear relationship between lake maximum depth and lake mean depth/volume. The different machine learning (ML) methods were then developed and tested based on the available lake deepest record and multi-type geospatial parameters. Although the linear model shows good performance for estimating lake mean depth (R2 = 0.83), it is difficult to predict lake volume (R2 = 0.23). Most ML models perform better (R2 >= 0.85) than linear models. However, the support vector machines (SVM) model (SVM-3: R2 = 0.54, MAPE = 134.93 %) and deep neural network (DNN) model (DNN-3: R2 = 0.83, MAPE = 82.56 %) constructed with low influential input parameters performed poorly. In contrast, extremely gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) methods have high stability and accuracy both in predicting lake mean depth (XGBoost-1: R2 = 0.87, MAPE = 23.35 %; RF-1: R2 = 0.90, MAPE = 22.75 %) and volume (XGBoost-3: R2 = 0.99, MAPE = 31.03 %; RF-3: R2 = 0.98, MAPE = 32.63 %). The RF and XGBoost models constructed with a small amount of measured lake depth data in a different region also had a good performance. Generally, the results suggest that the XGBoost and RF methods have great potential in lake volume estimation. This research is expected to provide a feasible approach to predict lake volume and benefit lake water resources management.

AB During the complex dynamic interactions between rainfall and basin properties, different portions of the basin produce runoff at different moments. Capturing this spatiotemporal variability is important for flood analysis, but knowledge of this subject is limited. The presented research aims at improving the understanding of runoff contributing areas (RCA; hillslope sections from which water flows, reaches the stream network, and consequently the basin outlet) and at examining their relationship with the magnitude of a flash flood's peak discharge. A distributed hydrological model (GB-HYDRA) that enables computing RCA and flood discharge was developed. The model was applied to four medium-size basins (18-69 km(2)) in a Mediterranean climate and 59 flash flood events were analyzed. The correlation between basin input flux (basin area multiplied by the basin maximal rain intensity averaged over the time of concentration) and output flux (observed peak discharge) was poor (R-2 = 0.16). However, using a newly developed index, termed IRCA, to calculate the input flux accounting only for the RCA extent and rainfall intensity over it, resulted in a substantially higher correlation (R-2 = 0.64) across a wide range of flood magnitudes. The highest correlation was found using a 50-min time window, which is shorter than the time of concentration. Flood events were categorized according to their magnitude and the differences of several factors among the groups were examined. Pre-storm soil moisture content was found to be similar for all event magnitudes; however, pre-peak soil moisture content was substantially different between moderate and large extreme events. Other important properties that differed between magnitudes were: RCA extent and its averaged rain intensity and ratio of convective rainfall. Finally, areas with land-uses characterized by low runoff potential became dominant and contributed mainly during large and extreme events. Although the RCA and its extent full potential is yet to be fulfilled, it is proposed as a significant tool for understanding processes of flash flood generation at the basin scale in future research.

AB Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) of surface soil changes substantially with space and time, and it is of great importance for many ecological, agricultural, and hydrological applications. In general, K is measured in the laboratory, or more commonly, predicted using soil water retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity. In the field, K can be determined through infiltration experiments. However, none of these approaches are capable of continuously monitoring K in-situ at fine depth scales. In this study, we propose and investigate an approach to continuously estimate fine depth-scale K dynamics under field conditions. Evaporation rate and change in water storage in a near-surface soil layer are measured with the heat pulse method. Then, water flux density at the lower boundary of the soil layer is estimated from evaporation rate, change in water storage, and rainfall or irrigation rate using a simple water balance approach. Finally, K values at different soil depths are derived using the Buckingham-Darcy equation from water flux densities and measured water potential gradients. A field experiment is performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. K values at 2-, 4-, 7.5-, and 12.5-cm depths are estimated with the new approach. The results show that in-situ K estimates vary with time following changes in soil water content, and the K-water content relationship changes with depth due to the difference in bulk density. In-situ estimated K-matric potential curves agree well with those measured in the laboratory. In-situ K estimates also show good agreement with the Mualem-van Genuchten model predictions, with an average root mean square error in log(10) (K, mm h(-1)) of 0.54 and an average bias of 0.17. The new approach provides reasonable in-situ K estimates and has potential to reveal the influences of natural soil conditions on hydraulic properties as they change with depth and time.

AB Soil and water conservation structures, promoted by local and international development organizations throughout rural landscapes, aim to increase recharge and prevent degradation of soil surface characteristics. This study investigates this unexamined relationship between recharge, water table depths, and soil surface characteristics (nutrients) in a small sub-watershed in the northwestern Ethiopian highlands. These highland watersheds have high infiltration rates (mean 70 mm hr(-1) median 33 mm hr(-1)), recharging the shallow unconfined hillslope aquifer with water transport occurring via subsurface pathways down the slope. The perched water tables reflect the subsurface flux and are deep where this flux is rapid in the upland areas (138 cm below surface). Soil saturation and overland flow occur when the subsurface flux exceeds the transport capacity of the soil in the lower downslope areas near the ephemeral stream (19 cm below surface). Land use is directly related to the water table depth, corresponding to grazing and fallowed (saturated) land in the downslope areas and cultivated (unsaturated) land in the middle and upper parts where the water table is deeper. Kjeldahl Total Nitrogen (TN), Bray II available phosphorus (AP), and exchangeable potassium (K+) averages exhibit different behaviors across slope, land use transects, or saturation conditions. TN was moderate to low (0.07% +/- 0.04) in various land uses and slope regions. Bray II AP had very low concentrations (0.25 mg kg(-1) +/- 0.26) among the different slope regions with no significant differences throughout (p > .05). The exchangeable cation (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) concentrations and pH, however, were greater in non-cultivated (seasonally saturated) lands and in a downslope direction (p < .001, p < .005, p < .05, and p < .005, respectively). These results show that the perched groundwater plays an important role in influencing land use, the amount of water seasonally available for crop growth, and exchangeable cations, but have no clear effect on the concentration of the two primarily applied nutrients in fertilizers (N, P).

AB In-stream structures can potentially enhance surface and subsurface solute retention. They form naturally in small streams and their installation has gained popularity in stream restoration for multiple purposes, including improved water quality. Yet few studies have quantified the cumulative effect of multiple structures on solute transport at the reach scale, nor how this varies with changing stream flow. We built a series of weirs in a small stream to simulate channel spanning structures such as natural debris dams and stream restoration log dams and boulder weirs. We conducted constant rate conservative (NaCl) tracer injections to quantify the effect of the weirs on solute transport at the reach scale. We used a one dimensional solute transport model with transient storage to quantify the change of solute transport parameters with increasing number of weirs. Results indicate that adding weirs significantly increased the cross-sectional area of the surface stream (A) and transient storage zones (A(s)) while exchange with transient storage (cc) decreased. The increase in A and As is due to backwater behind weirs and increased hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange induced by the weirs, while we surmise that the reduction in alpha is due at least in part to reduced hydrodynamically driven hyporheic exchange in bed ripples drowned by the weir backwater. In order for weir installation to achieve net improvement in solute retention and thus water quality, cumulative reactions in weir backwater and enhanced hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange would have to overcome the reduced hydrodynamically driven exchange. Analysis of channel flow variation over the course of the experiments indicated that weirs change the relationship between transient storage parameters and flow, for example the trend of increasing a with flow without weirs was reversed in the presence of weirs. Effects of flow variation were substantial, indicating that transient storage measurements at a single point in time typically cannot be extrapolated to estimate net annual effects. Thus, rigorous evaluation of water quality effects of stream restoration structures requires measurements at multiple channel flow rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on the bio-optical properties of highly turbid productive inland waterbody, Taihu Lake, a novel bio-optical optimization algorithm was developed to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration (C-chla) and total suspended matter concentration (C-TSM) after optical classification. Between 2006 and 2013, 1080 in situ samples collected from four inland lakes in China were utilized to test this optimization algorithm. All data were classified into four classes based on a new bio-optical classification method. The retrieval results of C-TSM and C-chla exhibit a good consistency with in situ measured C-TSM and C-chla. C-TSM retrieval accuracies (evaluated by the root mean square of percentage errors: RMSPs) of classes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 35.77%, 16.09%, 28.42%, and 26.86% for datal and were 32.15%, 33.14%, 47.71%, and 34.89% for data3, respectively. C-chla retrieval accuracies (RMSPs) of classes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 32.49%, 20.05%, 42.01%, and 34.85% for datal, were 44.71%, 32.59%, 47.92%, and 38.11% for data2, and were 33.12%, 25.65%, 70.88%, and 23.57% for data3, respectively. The optimization algorithm was also tested by the simulated data of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor satellite sensors' center wavelengths. The validation shows a good correlation with the measured C-TSM and C-chla. All these examinations demonstrate that the bio-optical optimization algorithm and classification are valid and robust for both the in situ data and the simulated satellite data. The optical relationships of a(ph)(440) to C-chla and b(bp)(440) to C-TSM are reasonable and effective. In summary, the results present that the bio-optical optimization algorithm proposed in this study shows high potential application to various water types and satellite sensors. The retrieval accuracy of C-TSM and C-chla derived by bio-optical optimization algorithm was significantly improved after classification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forest structure can both reduce and intensify precipitation inputs to the ground surface at fine spatial scales. Areas of localized input at the soil surface may have large effects on deep drainage because of the strongly nonlinear relationship between soil water content (SWC) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. We therefore explored the following questions: Does forest structure that creates high spatial heterogeneity in canopy throughfall also create associated deep percolation pathways capable of quickly moving water beyond the rooting zone? Or alternatively, do soil properties resulting from biological activity (e.g. root networks) reduce SWC heterogeneity created by the focused inputs from the canopy and eliminate the potential for these deep percolation pathways? We explored these questions by measuring spatial variation in both throughfall and SWC within 8 forested plots of the Sarapiqui region, Costa Rica where soil texture is relatively homogeneous within deep, clay-rich soils. A novel method that combined soil augering and frequency domain reflectometry was used to assess SWC profiles below the most extreme wet and dry throughfall locations within each plot. Findings revealed relatively homogeneous soil moisture within the surface root zone (0-90 cm depth) with SWC values of roughly 45%. Below the root zone, SWC heterogeneity increased, with the wettest throughfall sites having significantly (alpha = 0.05) higher SWC than their paired driest throughfall end-members (by 2-15%). Below approximately 130 cm depth, SWC homogeneity was observed again. Physically-based modeling in HYDRUS-3D supports these findings and suggests processes that may explain these changes in SWC patterns observed with increasing depth, such as redistribution through macropores, focused deep-percolation, and lateral downslope flow, respectively. This is the first field-based study that explores the linkage between throughfall heterogeneity and focused deep-percolation, and therefore advances the integrated understanding of how the structure, diversity, and spatial heterogeneity of forests influence their hydrologic outputs.

AB Despite the fact that electrical resistivity surveys are increasingly used to monitor solute migration in porous media, there is limited experience in how these data can be used to characterize aquifer transport parameters. In this study we evaluate whether electrical resistivity monitoring data can constrain the hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and dispersivity of a homogenous aquifer within the framework of coupled inversion. We focus on voltage responses from a single set of current electrodes to provide insights into the information content of these measurements and motivate future work in designing optimal surveys for monitoring groundwater transport processes. We have found that even in this simple system two distinct types of tradeoffs exist that could confound the direct estimation of transport parameters. First, different values of porosity and hydraulic conductivity can produce the same plume velocity, thereby leading to identical concentration distributions in the subsurface. In ideal cases this hydrologic non-uniqueness can be resolved by electrical data because electrical resistivity is dependent on both solute concentration and porosity, but this discrimination will only be possible when the rock physics relationship between concentration and resistivity can be accurately determined. The second type of non-uniqueness occurs when different concentration plumes produce equivalent electrical responses. In this case, tradeoffs between plume velocity and dispersivity cause shifts in the position and mass of solute relative to the electrodes that result in equivalent values of subsurface apparent resistivity. This non-uniqueness contributes to poor discriminating power when using an objective function based on the magnitude of voltage changes. However, the problem can be overcome by explicitly recognizing that different information about transport processes is captured by the timing versus magnitude of the electrical response in monitoring data. Though we have investigated a homogenous system, we argue that the insights here can also be applied to the estimation of effective transport parameters for heterogeneous systems.

AB Pebble mulches have been used to conserve soil moisture in the semiarid regions of China for over 300 years. However, little work has been carried out on rainfall interception loss by a pebble mulch layer. A field study was conducted to measure interception loss by pebble mulches during individual rainfall events, determine the rainfall-storage capacity of pebble mulch, and discuss the relationships between interception and rainfall parameters. The study showed that pebble size could affect interception loss. A 5 cm-thick pebble mulch layer, with pebbles 7.5-14.0 cm in the long dimension and 5.0-9.0 cm in the short dimension (larger pebble), had a saturation value of 0.281 mm, an average interception of 0.481 mm. and an average percentage interception of 11.5% during individual rainfall events. In contrast, a similar layer, with pebbles 2.0-6.5 cm in the long dimension and 2.0-6.0 cm in the short dimension (smaller pebble), had a saturation value of 0.526 mm, and an average interception of 0.742 mm, or 17.4% gross rainfall per storm. The correlation between interception by pebble mulch and gross rainfall was poor. The proportion of gross rainfall intercepted by pebble mulch tended to decrease as gross rainfall increased. The reduction in percentage was very marked for rains over 10 mm. Interception showed a tendency to decline with increasing rain intensity (I-30). There was a broad variability in interception for intensities under 6 mm h(-1). Interception tended to remain constant at about 0.25 mm for larger pebble and 0.40 mm for smaller pebble when intensity was over 6 mm h(-1). Antecedent water content of pebble before a storm significantly affected interception loss, with about 50% interception occurring in the initial stage of a rainfall event. Rainfall duration and wind factors should, therefore, also be considered in future interception analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasingly available high-frequency data during storm events, when hydrological dynamics most likely activate nitrate storage-flux exchanges, reveal insights into catchment nitrate dynamics. In this study, we explored impacts of seasonality and landscape gradients on nitrate concentration-discharge (C-Q) hysteresis patterns in the Selke catchment, central Germany, which has heterogeneous combinations of meteorological, hydrogeological and land use conditions. Three nested gauging stations established along the main Selke River captured flow and nitrate export dynamics from the uppermost subcatchment (mixed forest and arable land), middle subcatchment (pure steep forest) and lowermost subcatchment (arable and urban land). We collected continuous high-frequency (15-min) discharge and nitrate concentration data from 2012 to 2017 and analyzed the 223 events detected at all three stations. A dominant hysteresis pattern in the uppermost and middle subcatchments was counter-clockwise and combined with an accretion effect, indicating many proximal and mobilized distal nitrate sources. However, 66% of all events at the catchment outlet experienced a dilution effect, possibly due to mechanisms that vary seasonally. During wetting/wet periods (October-March), it was combined mainly with a counter-clockwise pattern due to the dominance of event runoff volume from the uppermost and middle subcatchments. During drying/dry periods (April-September), however, it was combined mainly with a clockwise pattern due to occasional quick surface flows from lowland near-stream urban areas. In addition, the clockwise hysteresis occurred mainly from May-October during mostly drying/dry periods at all three sites, indicating little distal nitrate transport in response to the low terrestrial hydrological connectivity, especially in the lowermost dry and flat sub-catchment. This comprehensive analysis (i.e., clockwise vs. counter-clockwise, accretion vs. dilution) enables in-depth analysis of nitrate export mechanisms during certain periods under different landscape conditions. Specific combination of C-Q relationships could identify target locations for agricultural management actions that decrease nitrate output. Therefore, we strongly encourage long-term multisite and high-frequency monitoring strategies in heterogeneous nested catchment(s), which can help understand process mechanisms, generate data for physical-based water-quality modeling and provide guidance for water and agricultural management.

AB Long lead-time streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resources planning and management in both the short and long terms. Despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting, only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead-time forecasting capabilities of these methods, and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a long short term memory (LSTM), a powerful tool for learning long-term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship, have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead-time period. For long lead-time streamflow forecasting, a recursive forecasting procedure, which takes the last one-step-ahead forecast as a new input for the next-step-ahead forecast, is used in the ANN and LSTM forecasting systems. Two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin, Thailand, covering the period 1974 to 2014. To further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance, two parameters, i.e. the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs, are examined in the ANN and LSTM models. The main findings are highlighted here. First, with an optimal setting up of model parameters, both the ANN and LSTM model can provide accurate daily forecasting (up to 20 days ahead). Second, in comparison to the ANN model, the LSTM model exhibits better model performance in long lead-time daily forecasting, but less satisfactory in multi-monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset. Third, the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ANN and LSTM modelling are the key for long lead-time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales. These findings suggest that the LSTM could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management.

AB Flash floods are a worldwide threat to humans, which is why they are being intensively studied using historical event records. As measurements and event data increase, databases are becoming increasingly important for flash flood research. However, the recent literature on flood databases lacks technical details as well as discussions about a suitable database design for scientific investigations. In this paper, we thus show how an event database for the investigation of heavy rain-induced flood occurrences can be created. Based on the HiOS dataset (a German dataset with similar to 23,800 flash flood and pluvial flood events), we exemplify the database design and explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of floods caused by heavy rain in Germany. We outline all aspects relevant to database setup: from database requirements and system architecture through table and attribute design to a key and relationship definition. Furthermore, we clarify why a spatial database with interfaces for GIS softwares should be chosen, why a damage-based event definition is preferable to a hydrometeorological definition, and how table attributes support differentiated analyses. By means of the database, we investigated frequency, temporal evolution, spatial distribution and patterns, fatalities and injuries, as well as the seasonality of heavy rain-induced floods in Germany. The results indicate that floods caused by heavy rain occur throughout Germany but with a tendency toward fewer events in the northern direction. Across the country, we identified seven hot spots in urbanized and mountainous regions. Although heavy rain-induced floods in Germany take place mostly between noon and late afternoon, most people are injured and killed in events starting in the evening. Our investigation indicates an increased incidence of flash flood and pluvial flood-related injuries and fatalities in the identified hot spots. Overall, we observe a pronounced summer seasonality of the heavy rain-induced flood events. This study highlights the importance of event databases for flash flood research and advances our understanding of heavy rain-induced flood occurrences in Germany.

AB Under the background of climate variability and anthropogenic stresses, changes of the runoff and sediment processes have drawn increasing concerns during the past decades. Analyzing the evolution characteristics and causes of runoff and sediment load is critical for the sustainable development of water resource and terrestrial ecosystems of river basins. This study presents an integrated approach for analyzing the evolution characteristics of the annual runoff and sediment load, including the trend, periodicity, change point and their correlations in the Wujiang River basin (WRB) -a typical mountainous river system in southwest China, based on the observed data during the period 1970-2016. On this basis, the contributions of climate variability and human activities on runoff change were first distinguished by using a widely applied Budyko-based hydrological sensitivity method, and then the quantified result was further applied in the attribution analysis of river sediment load change. Research results revealed that the change patterns of runoff and sediment processes, such as the trend, periodicity and potential change point, as well as the relationships of precipitation-runoff and runoff-sediment load are quite different in the WRB. Quantitative assessment revealed that climate variability contributes to 71.5%-85.6% changes of mean annual runoff in 1985-1994, 1995-2004 and 2005-2016 with reference to the baseline period of 1970-1984. In contrary, human activities dominate the reduction of sediment load in the river, and the contribution rate ranged in 67.2%-107.5%. Variations of annual runoff in the WRB was the direct result of climate variability, while land use change played a secondary role. The construction of cascade hydropower reservoirs, particularly in the upper and middle reaches of the Wujiang River is fundamentally responsible for the significant decreasing and the weakened periodicity of sediment load as well as the changed runoff-sediment load correlation at Wulong station in recent years. However, this influence was not big enough to modify the regime of annual runoff.

AB The different types of soil macropores (e.g., biopores and non-biopores) vary in the conductivity of water or air due to the difference in the 3D pore characteristics. The objectives of this study were to reveal which types of macropores and which macropore characteristics played the most important roles in regulating water or air flow. Intact soil columns sampled from the subsoil of a long-term fertilization experiment were scanned by medical X-ray computed tomography (CT), and subsequently, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and air permeability at -12 cm water potential (K-a12) were measured. The 3D characteristics of macropores were then analyzed with image analysis. The biopores and the percolating biopores that connected the top and the bottom of a soil column were separated for the biopore-dominated samples (with percolating biopores) and their 3D characteristics were also quantified. Our results showed that the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer (MDLL) presented the best relationships with K(s )and K-a12 compared with the other macropore characteristics for all the samples. The biopores and percolating biopores contributed 27.8-74.5% and 3.26-64.4% of the volume of total macropores, respectively, for the biopore-dominated samples. The hydraulic radius, mean diameter, compactness, global and local connectivities, and MDLL of biopores, especially those of percolating biopores, were generally larger than those of total macropores. The global connectivity (Gamma) of biopores performed very well for estimating K(s )and K-a12. The MDLL of percolating biopores could predict K-s much better than the MDLL of biopores and total macropores. Moreover, the performance of MDLL for estimating K-a12 was as good as the MDLL of biopores but was much better than the MDLL of total macropores. The findings of this study reveal that the MDLL is a more useful parameter in estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability at low water potential than the other CT-derived pore characteristics.

AB The cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CANS), which estimates field scale soil water content, bridges the gap between point measurement and remote sensing. The accuracy of CRNS measurements, however, is affected by additional hydrogen pools (e.g., vegetation, snow, and rainfall interception). The objectives of this study are to: (i) evaluate the accuracy of CRNS estimates in a farmland system using depth and horizontal weighted point measurements, (ii) introduce a novel method for estimating the amounts of hydrogen from biomass and snow cover in CRNS data, and (iii) propose a simple approach for correcting the influences of aboveground hydrogen pool (expressed as aboveground water equivalent, AWE) on CRNS measurements. A field experiment was conducted in northeast China to compare soil water content results from CANS to in-situ data with time domain reflectometry (TDR) and neutron probe (NP) in the 0-40 cm soil layers. The biomass water equivalent (BWE) and snow water equivalent (SWE) were observed to have separate linear relationships with the thermal fast neutron ratio, and the dynamics of BWE and SWE were estimated correctly in the crop seasons and snow-covered seasons, respectively. A simple approach, which considered the AWE, AWE at calibration, and the effective measurement depth of CRNS, was introduced to correct the errors caused by BWE and SWE. After correction, the correlation coefficients between soil water contents determined by CRNS and TDR were 0.79 and 0.77 during the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons, respectively, and CRNS measurements had RMSEs of 0.028, 0.030, and 0.039 m(3) m(-3) in the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons and the snow-covered seasons, respectively. The experimental results also indicated that the accuracies of CRNS estimated BWE and SWE were affected by the distributions of aboveground hydrogen pools, which were related to the height of the CRNS device above ground surface.

AB This paper aims to interpret the low-velocity nonlinear flow occurring in low-permeability reservoirs based on the theories of electrokinetic transport and non-Newtonian rheology of fluids. To achieve this end, we simulate the steady-state electroviscous flow of Bingham-Papanastasiou (BP) fluids in circular microtubes by simultaneously solving the Poisson-Boltzmann and the modified Navier-Stokes equations. The induced electrical field strength vertical bar E-s vertical bar, velocity profiles, and the transport capacity of the non-Newtonian fluid under the effects of various factors (such as capillary radius R, zeta potential zeta, yield stress tau(0), and stress growth index m) were examined. The results show that the generated vertical bar E-s vertical bar of the BP fluid is highly affected by the fluid rheology, which is quite different from that of the Newtonian liquid. The velocity profiles become lower and flatter as m or tau(0) increases, and this is more remarkable in smaller microtubes. The apparent viscosity of non-Newtonian fluid declines monotonically with increasing c(infinity), yet non-monotonically with R, m, tau(0), and zeta. In addition, the low-velocity nonlinear flow in microtubes can be successfully captured when considering the electrokinetic flow of the nonNewtonian fluid rheology. While for the Newtonian fluid, only involving the electroviscous effect fails to generate the nonlinear flow behavior. The contributions of electrokinetic parameters versus rheological properties to the degree of flow nonlinearity are also discussed. The impact of electrokinetic parameters (zeta, c(infinity)) on the flow characteristics is significant at high-pressure gradients and becomes trivial when the pressure gradient is relatively low. In contrast, the fluid rheological parameters (m, tau(0)) greatly determine the magnitude of the flow nonlinearity occurring at the low-pressure gradients. In sum, the electroviscous flow of BP fluids in microchannels provides a possible explanation of the low-velocity non-Darcy flow in porous media.

AB Understanding the effects of climate and catchment characteristics on hydrological behavior is critical in hydrological sciences. Furthermore, improving the clarity associated with the physical meaning of the Budyko hypothesis on how it can be incorporated into ecohydrological processes remains a significant challenge, while the conciseness it affords in addressing hydrological responses has promoted its application. This study explores the hydrological effects of the snow fraction (fs) and assesses the ecohydrological meaning of the catchment parameter (n) within the Budyko framework, employing 1576 globally investigated catchments. Results showed that the Budyko hypothesis decreased systematic errors (NS = 0.76, RMSE = 181.01 mm a-1) when incorporating the fs compared with no snow fraction incorporated it (NS = 0.54, RMSE = 248.85 mm a-1), especially for catchments with higher fs. In these catchments, a higher fs was generally consistent with a higher normalized mean streamflow (Q), while the opposite was true for normalized evaporation (E/P). Under the Budyko framework, n and fs distribution generally exhibited opposite trends. Moreover, higher n was mainly distributed near water limited and the highest energy limited boundaries, while higher fs represented lower (P-Q)/P (i.e., the mean (P-Q)/P was 0.59, 0.57, and 0.38 for catchments with lower (fs < 0.15), medium (0.15 <= fs < 0.50), and higher (fs >= 0.50) fs). Statistical relationships among ecohydrological processes and catchment parameter suggested that: (i) higher storm depth (alpha) generally indicated higher normalized mean Q; (ii) a higher plant-available water holding capacity (kappa) resulted in a reduction in Q/P, especially when kappa was > 0.12; (iii) the effective rooting depth (Ze) exhibited a complex regulatory effect on P partitioning; and (iv) alpha, Ze, and kappa controlled n by 65%, 22%, and 13%, respectively, in all catchments. The ecohydrological processes incorporated into catchment parameters will broaden the ability of the Budyko hypothesis to describe hydrological behavior in a changing world, especially in the ungauged catchment.

AB The local meteoric water line (LMWL) reflects the relationship between stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation, and is usually calculated using an ordinary least squares regression (OLSR). When event-based data are used to calculate a LMWL, the differences in precipitation amount of samples are not considered using OLSR, which in turn may influence the representativeness of the LMWL for local hydrology. Small rain events occur widely in arid Central Asia (annual mean precipitation < 150 mm), and where smaller precipitation has lower deuterium excess, this results in LMWLs with slopes and intercepts lower than the global average. Based on an observation network of isotopes in precipitation across the Tianshan Mountains in arid Central Asia, LMWLs for 23 stations are calculated from event-based data from 2012 to 2013 (n = 978), using ordinary least squares, reduced major axis and major axis regressions and their precipitation-weighted counterparts. For the northern slope and mountainous areas, the LMWL slope and intercept are close to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), but the slope and intercept are lower for the southern slope indicating the greater dominance of sub-cloud evaporation. The effect of moisture recycling in the irrigated areas on the northern slope also can be seen where the LMWL slopes are > 8. Using a precipitation weighted regression method with event-based data (especially precipitation-weighted reduced major axis regression, PWRMA) is generally consistent with the OLSR regression using monthly data. However, event-based datasets provide a wider range of values to better constrain the regression than can be achieved using monthly data over a short period, providing a sounder basis for determining LMWLs for relatively short-term sampling campaigns in an arid setting. The use of the PWRMA regression is preferred for determining the LMWL for the Tianshan Mountains, and results in a regional meteoric water line of delta D = 7.9 delta O-l8 + 10.16.

AB Runoff and sediment loads from river basin are largely affected by the interplay of climate variability and human activities within the basin. However, distinguishing the impacts of climate variability and human activities would vastly improve our knowledge of water resources, climate variability and climate adaptation, and watershed management. We propose a new and simple method to determine the impact of human activities within paired datasets under the same or similar weather conditions (SWC). These weather conditions cover one or more meteorological elements such as precipitation, temperature, or evaporation. If there are two or more periods with similar weather conditions but different runoff, the relative runoff and sediment load changes can be considered a consequence of human-induced land surface changes. This study will report on the application of this new method, using the Yan River Basin in China as a case study. We found 10 sets PPs (paired periods) in 1 year intervals and 12 sets of PPs in intervals of 3 years when (1) there was a 2.0% and 1.0% difference of annual precipitation and annual ETO, respectively, (2) the relationship between monthly precipitation and ETO of PPs was significant (P < 0.05) and, (3) there was no overlap of years for the PPs with intervals of 1 and 3 years. We found that the impact of human activities varied greatly between PPs, with the main trend of declining PPs, matched the trends evident from statistical analysis and land use and land cover (LULC) change evaluation. The method is simple and easily applicable to selected periods in most areas and could be extended when more detailed data are available. The result of this method is the impact of all human activities, allowing for further discussion on the contributions of each kind of human activity over time in determining the range which links the research results at different scales, e.g. to define the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) describing soil erosion on catchment slopes and sediment load in the river.

AB Despite the significant spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture, the phenomenon of temporal stability of soil moisture (TS SM) has been widely observed in field studies. However, the lack of understandings of the factors that control TS SM has led to some contradictory findings about TS SM. To resolve this issue, numerical models may offer an alternative way to complement field studies by quantifying different controls on TS SM. In this study, a 1-D vadose zone model was adopted to simulate daily soil moisture contents, which were used to compute the mean relative difference (MRD) and standard deviation of relative difference (SDRD) of soil moisture. Different from recent modeling studies, a soil dataset was employed with 200 samples of correlated soil hydraulic parameters for sandy soils. Compared to the results of previous modeling studies, more reasonable patterns of MRD and SDRD that resembled field observations were produced. By varying soil hydraulic parameter values, different patterns of MRD and SDRD could also be generated, implying variations in soil hydraulic properties could partly control the patterns of MRD and SDRD. More specifically, the residual soil moisture content (Or) was found to be the primary control on MRD, mainly due to the semi-arid climate that was simulated. By fixing 0,, however, a highly nonlinear relationship emerged between MRD and the shape factor n in the van Genuchten model, which resulted in the positively skewed distributions of MRD widely observed for sandy soils in field experiments. Moreover, both the range and skewness of the distributions of MRD were affected by the range of n. In addition, with increasing n, a positive correlation between MRD and the shape factor I in the van Genuchten model was also found. The simulation results suggested that the control of soil hydraulic properties on MRD might weaken for areas under bare surface conditions or for regions with more humid climates due to elevated soil moisture contents. Therefore, the impacts of soil hydraulic properties on TS SM may vary under different climate regimes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dam break outburst floods are sudden, short-lived and high-magnitude discharges of water and sediment propagating over an initially 'dry' terrain. Both field observations by geoscientists and experimental measurements by engineers have produced understanding of outburst floods but neither approach has satisfactorily supplied data that is directly of use to hazard managers. This study draws together those two literature groups and provides new experimental data to test hypotheses concerning the effect of a series of external controls on resultant longitudinal flow propagation and transitory hydraulics. These external controls form experimental treatments and are; (i) the height of the lock gate raise as a surrogate for dam breach evolution and initial hydrograph, (ii) bed roughness, and (iii) suspended sediment concentration. These control both horizontal and vertical fluid motion, the latter of which is a key property for controlling aeration, bed shear stress and turbulence intensity. The experimental treatments show that outburst floods on horizontal beds can be identified to possess three longitudinal flow regimes. Firstly, there is a short acceleration due to the reservoir pressure level; i.e. the depth of impounded water. Secondly, channel flow quickly converges to an inertial regime. The third flow regime is viscous and dominated by channel bed friction. Flow depth increases in the inertial regime, then decreases in the viscous regime. Experiments herein show that the timing of the peaks at-a-point down channel of each hydraulic quantity varies; most notably peak bed shear stress precedes flow velocity, which precedes peak flow depth. A point of inflexion occurs with distance down channel that is a manifestation of the transition from accelerating to decelerating flows. These external controls, and the effects of them on longitudinal and vertical motion are analysed statistically and quantitative relationships are derived to underpin the resultant conceptual model. This conceptual model should serve as a platform for future probabilistic and process-based modelling of outburst floods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Actual evapotranspiration (AET) is a critical component of hydrological processes. Accurate estimation of AET variation and its driving hydrological factors is vital for natural hazard adaptation and water resource management. This study first used AET observations from FLUXNET at 12 flux tower sites representing four different land cover types and three climate zones over Northeast Asia. Then the relationships and seasonal patterns among AET and seven hydrological variables of gross primary production (GPP), wind speed (WS), air temperature (T-a), net radiation (R-N), soil moisture (S-M), precipitation (P), and air pressure (P-a) were assessed using Bayesian model averaging (BMA). Finally, the performance of BMA was examined at all flux tower sites, and the impact of factor importance to predicting performance was analyzed. Generally, the results demonstrated higher AET values at sites associated with temperate and cropland areas. Analysis of the contributions of key elements to AET based on BMA suggested that RN and GPP were the two most sensitive factors for AET variation over all the selected sites. With the exception of RN and GPP, WS strongly influenced AET estimations in the wetland and cold regions. AET variation in the cropland and grassland regions was significantly affected by SM. Regardless of landscape type and climate zone, RN was the most important variable in each season, followed by GPP, WS, T-a, and SM. T-a was found to be important in spring, while WS showed a strong influence on AET in winter. In terms of prediction performance, the mean correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) of the BMA model was 0.92 and 0.49 mm/day, respectively. Using more factors with a posterior inclusion probability larger than 0.9 improved the performance of BMA. Overall, the strong correlation and low error demonstrate that BMA is an effective approach to capturing AET and exploring its interaction with climatological anomalies across different regions, especially under varied agricultural conditions, which could improve crop water management.

AB Fog is considered as an important source of water in many drylands, and the knowledge of possible sources of its formation is essential to make future predictions. Prior studies have suggested the presence of locally generated fog in drylands; however, its formation mechanism remains unclear. There have been studies on the effects of fog on soil moisture dynamics. On the contrary, no research has yet been conducted to understand the potential contribution of soil moisture to fog formation. This study, therefore, for the first time intends to examine such possibility in a fog-dominated dryland ecosystem, the Namib Desert. The study was conducted at two sites representing two different land forms (sand dunes and gravel plains) in the Namib Desert. We first examined evidence of fog formation through water vapor movement using field observations, and then simulated water vapor transport using HYDRUS-1D model. In the first part of the study, soil moisture, soil temperature and air temperature data were analyzed, and the relationships between these variables were taken as one of the key indicators for the linkage between soil water and fog formation. The analysis showed that increase in soil moisture generally corresponded to similar increase in air or soil temperature near the soil surface, which implied that variation in soil moisture might be the result of water vapor movement (evaporated soil moisture) from lower depths to the soil surface. In the second part of the study, surface fluxes of water vapor were simulated using the HYDRUS-1D model to explore whether the available surface flux was sufficient to support fog formation. The surface flux and cumulative evaporation obtained from the model showed positive surface fluxes of water vapor. Based on the field observations and the HYDRUS-1D model results, it can be concluded that water vapor from soil layers is transported through the vadose zone to the surface and this water vapor likely contributes to the fog formation in fog-dominated drylands, like the Namib Desert.

AB Uncertainties about the age of base-flow discharge can have serious implications for the management of degraded environmental systems where subsurface pathways, and the ongoing release of pollutants that accumulated in the subsurface during past decades, dominate the water quality signal. Numerical groundwater models may be used to estimate groundwater return times and base-flow ages and thus predict the time required for stakeholders to see the results of improved agricultural management practices. However, the uncertainty inherent in the relationship between (i) the observations of atmospherically-derived tracers that are required to calibrate such models and (ii) the predictions of system age that the observations inform have not been investigated. For example, few if any studies have assessed the uncertainty of numerically-simulated system ages or evaluated the uncertainty reductions that may result from the expense of collecting additional subsurface tracer data. In this study we combine numerical flow and transport modeling of atmospherically-derived tracers with prediction uncertainty methods to accomplish four objectives. First, we show the relative importance of head, discharge, and tracer information for characterizing response times in a uniquely data rich catchment that includes 266 age-tracer measurements (SF6, CFCs, and H-3) in addition to long term monitoring of water levels and stream discharge. Second, we calculate uncertainty intervals for model-simulated base-flow ages using both linear and non-linear methods, and find that the prediction sensitivity vector used by linear first order second-moment methods results in much larger uncertainties than non-linear Monte Carlo methods operating on the same parameter uncertainty. Third, by combining prediction uncertainty analysis with multiple models of the system, we show that data-worth calculations and monitoring network design are sensitive to variations in the amount of water leaving the system via stream discharge and irrigation withdrawals. Finally, we demonstrate a novel model-averaged computation of potential data worth that can account for these uncertainties in model structure. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study we used a dual stable isotope approach (delta O-18 and (delta H-2) to assess the ecohydrological separation hypothesis and to identify the seasonal variation in water sources of Ginkgo biloba L in the riparian zone in the Taihu Lake basin, China. Three study sites located at 5,10, and 30 m from a river bank were established. From August 2014 to July 2015, samples of rainwater, river water, groundwater, bulk soil water at five soil depths (i.e. 0-30,30-60,60-90,90-120,120-150 cm), and xylem water of G. biloba, were collected and their delta O-18 and delta H-2 values were measured. Generally, the delta O-18 and delta H-2 values for xylem water, groundwater, and soil water clustered together and separated from those of river water, suggesting the possible occurrence of ecohydrological separation. However, the line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) values of most xylem water were positive, indicating a mixture of different water sources. Significant correlations were observed between the contributions of precipitation, soil water, and groundwater to water uptake by G. biloba, further supporting ecohydrological connectivity rather than ecohydrological separation. G. biloba switched its major water sources from soil water at 0-60 cm depth and precipitation in the wet summer, to soil water from >90 cm depth and groundwater in the dry winter. The river water was a minor water source for G. biloba, but its contribution was comparatively greater at the site closest to the river bank. Our findings contribute to understanding of plant-soil-water relationships and the water balance, and may provide important information for investigations of nutrient sources and sinks in riparian zones. The present study suggests the need to rethink the application of ecohydrological connectivity and separation in different biomes, especially where river water and groundwater recharge each other over time.

AB Bedrock rivers exhibit very different hydraulic and ecological regimes compared to alluvial rivers. Groundwater-surface water interaction in rivers that flow directly on sedimentary bedrock surfaces with exposed fracture and conduit networks is generally based on alluvial river conceptual models. However, the dual and triple porosity systems of sedimentary rock (e.g., matrix, fractures and vugs) leads to highly variable hydraulic pathways and groundwater velocities that, in turn, result in processes that are very different than those derived from alluvial concepts. Relative to alluvial rivers there has been very little direct examination of dynamic interactions, such as fluxes, groundwater velocities, and mechanisms affecting water quality across the channel interface; this is largely because bedrock rivers are difficult to instrument and monitor given their heterogeneous and anisotropic flow systems. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of non-invasive, low impact ground-penetrating radar and frequency-domain electromagnetic induction methods capable of detecting discrete fracture and conduit features, mapping complex distributions of lithostratigraphic interfaces, and providing information about formation properties along a partially exposed section of the Eramosa River located in Ontario, Canada. Geophysical data are supported by direct hydrogeologic and geologic information obtained from a nearby borehole piezometer cluster and a continuous 15 m rock core. Valuable insights were gained into the lateral extent and geometry of structurally-controlled whydrostratigraphic units (e.g., dissolution-enhanced fractures, epikarst and karst features), which are expected to strongly influence groundwater and surface water interaction along the channel. An integrated application of GPR and EMI methods was necessary to fully understand the complex geometry of geologic boundaries and karst features within the shallow bedrock aquifer. The identification of epikarst below fluvial sediment and its relationship to the formation of dissolution features, exposed fracture conduit networks and sinkholes represents the basis for understanding the dynamic hydraulic responses between the surface water and the shallow bedrock aquifer.

AB Groundwater upwelling to streams creates unique habitat by influencing stream water quality and temperature; upwelling zones also serve as vectors for contamination when groundwater is degraded. Temperature time series data acquired along vertical profiles in the streambed have been applied to simple analytical models to determine rates of vertical fluid flux. These models are based on the downward propagation characteristics (amplitude attenuation and phase-lag) of the surface diurnal signal. Despite the popularity of these models, there are few published characterizations of moderate-to-strong upwelling. We attribute this limitation to the thermodynamics of upwelling, under which the downward conductive signal transport from the streambed interface occurs opposite the upward advective fluid flux. Governing equations describing the advection-diffusion of heat within the streambed predict that under upwelling conditions, signal amplitude attenuation will increase, but, counterintuitively, phase-lag will decrease. Therefore the extinction (measurable) depth of the diurnal signal is very shallow, but phase lag is also short, yielding low signal to noise ratio and poor model sensitivity. Conversely, amplitude attenuation over similar sensor spacing is strong, yielding greater potential model sensitivity. Here we present streambed thermal time series over a range of moderate to strong upwelling sites in the Quash-net River, Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The predicted inverse relationship between phase-lag and rate of upwelling was observed in the field data over a range of conditions, but the observed phase-lags were consistently shorter than predicted. Analytical solutions for fluid flux based on signal amplitude attenuation return results consistent with numerical models and physical seepage meters, but the phase-lag analytical model results are generally unreasonable. Through numerical modeling we explore reasons why phase-lag may have been over-predicted by the analytical models, and develop guiding relations of diurnal temperature signal extinction depth based on stream diurnal signal amplitude, upwelling magnitude, and streambed thermal properties that will be useful in designing future experiments.

AB We combined electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) on land and in a stream with zone-based hydraulic conductivities (from multi-level slug testing) to investigate the local geological heterogeneity of the deposits in a wetland-stream system. The detailed geology was incorporated into a numerical steady-state groundwater model that was calibrated against average head observations. The model results were tested against groundwater fluxes determined from streambed temperature measurements. Discharge varied up to one order of magnitude across the stream and the model was successful in capturing this variability. Water quality analyses from multi-level sampling underneath the streambed and in the wetland showed a stratification in groundwater composition with an aerobic shallow zone with oxygen and nitrate (top similar to 3 m) overlying a reduced, anoxic zone. While NO3- concentrations up to 58 mg L-1 were found in the top of the aquifer and immediately underneath the streambed no NO; was detected deeper within the aquifer. An inverse relationship between NO3- and SO42- suggests that pyrite oxidation takes place in the deeper parts of the aquifer. Simulated flow path lines showed very different origins for deeper groundwater samples. No nitrate reduction is believed to occur in the shallow zone, where oxygen is present, and the residence time is on the order of 1 year. Nitrate reduction can, however, occur in the deeper parts, which are oxygen-free, and where the residence time is on the order of 7 years. A simulation with a homogeneous model did not match the observations nearly as well as a heterogeneous model based on ERT and a spatially distributed hydraulic conductivity. Furthermore, the origin of the sampled groundwater could not have been predicted from groundwater hydraulic head and the groundwater chemistry alone. The presented approach of integrating such methods in groundwater-surface water exchange studies, proved efficient to obtain information of the controlling factors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Runoff response to rain events depends on the initial moisture conditions in the subsurface. This study explores subsurface stormflow response to initial conditions within the context of a continuous hillslope water balance. A hypothetical hillslope with three-dimensional variably saturated subsurface flow is developed using the HYDRUS model forced with a year-long sequence of hourly precipitation and transpiration from Seattle, WA, USA. Using six different soil hydraulic parameter sets, test simulations examine (1) variability of hillslope initial conditions prior to rain events, (2) persistence of initial conditions in a continuous simulation, and (3) effects of initial conditions on subsurface stormflow during rain events. Results show that hillslope initial conditions vary seasonally, producing bimodal distributions of storage values with preferred storage ranges for wet and dry seasons. Preferred storage ranges differ by soil texture and by hydraulic conductivity. Wet season initial conditions are most frequently at storage values above hillslope field capacity, with higher preferred ranges of storage for scenarios with lower saturated hydraulic conductivity. Dry season hillslope storage values converge to minimum values below field capacity, and these minimum values vary with soil texture but not with saturated hydraulic conductivity. Tests of initial condition convergence show that scenarios with different initial storages can eventually converge under either persistent wetting or persistent drying until hillslope storage reaches the wet or dry preferred states. Dry preferred states are unlikely to produce subsurface stormflow, as test rain events generate hillslope outflow only when initial storage is at or above an event and parameter-specific threshold near the hillslope field capacity. Above this flow threshold, all simulations show a nonlinear increase in subsurface stormflow with increasing initial storage, with the steepest rates of increase for scenarios with the highest values of saturated hydraulic conductivity. Simulation experiments present a quantitative approach for deriving functional relationships between event response, initial storage, and hillslope water retention. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aim is to build a seasonal flood frequency analysis model and estimate seasonal design floods. The importance of seasonal flood frequency analysis and the advantages of considering seasonal design floods in the derivation of reservoir planning and operating rules are discussed, recognising that seasonal flood frequency models have been in use for over 30 years. A set of non-identical models with non-constant parameters is proposed and developed to describe flows that reflect seasonal flood variation. The peak-over-threshold (POT) sampling method was used, as it is considered to provide significantly more information on flood seasonality than annual maximum (AM) sampling and has better performance in flood seasonality estimation. The number of exceedences is assumed to follow the Poisson distribution (Po), while the peak exceedences are described by the exponential (Ex) and generalized Pareto (GP) distributions and a combination of both, resulting in three models, viz. Po-Ex, Po-GP and Po-Ex/GP. Their performances are analysed and compared. The Geheyan and the Baiyunshan reservoirs were chosen for the case study. The application and statistical experiment results show that each model has its merits and that the Po-Ex/GP model performs best. Use of the Po-Ex/GP model is recommended in seasonal flood frequency analysis for the purpose of deriving reservoir operation rules.

AB The Shenzhen River estuary is a small estuary in highly urbanized regions between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, China. An increasing amount of sediment has been observed to accumulate in the estuary, imposing a severe impact on the ecological environment. In this study we utilized a series of hydrographic and bathymetry surveys to study the hydrology, sediment transport and morphological processes in the estuary. Flow and sediment circulation patterns in different seasons were inferred using current velocity, salinity and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) time series collected in the hydrographic surveys in conjunction with fathometer profiles in bathymety surveys. Historical time series at two stations were also analyzed by Mann-Kendall test for possible trends of the driving forces for estuarine morphological processes. The two-dimensional depth-averaged DELFT numerical model was employed to simulate the flow, salinity and SSC fields during the synchronous surveys and to predict the long-term morphological processes in the estuary. A bimodal SSC distribution was observed with two high-SSC zones separated by a low-SSC zone near the central bay, which cannot be explained by the conventional nongravitational transport theory of Postma (1967). It is hypothesized that sediment circulation in the estuary can be separated into two different systems: the "tidal zone" is under the influence of marine sediment from the Pearl River estuary, whereas the "fluvial zone" is mainly affected by terrestrial sediment from the river. Sediment mass exchange between the two systems is limited due to the presence of the low-SSC zone, the location of which could vary with the relative strengths of river flow and tides. The trend analysis of historical time series shows that the river discharge and the mean sea level are increasing and the flood tide range and the ebb tide range are decreasing. These trends are closely related to the intense human activities in the urbanization of Shenzhen. The long-term simulations show depositional trends for the inner bay and the coastline of the outer bay, which could be further aggravated by the detected trends of the driving forces.

AB For more than a century, hydrologists and hydrogeologists have been investigating the processes of stream and spring baseflow recession, for obtaining data on aquifer characteristics. The Maillet Formula [Librairie Sci., A. Hermann, Paris (1905) 218], an exponential equation widely used for recession curve analysis, is an approximate analytical solution for the diffusion equation in porous media whereas the equation proposed by Boussinesq [C. R. Acad. Sci. 137 (1903) 5; J. Math. Pure Appl. 10 (1904) 5], that depicts baseflow recession as a quadratic form, is an exact analytical solution. Other formulas currently used involve mathematical functions with no basis on groundwater theory. Only the exact analytical solutions can provide quantitative data on aquifer characteristics.
   The efficiency of the two methods was compared on the basis of recession curves obtained with a 2D cross-sectional finite differences model that simulates natural aquifers. Simulations of shallow aquifers with an impermeable floor at the level of the outlet show that their recession curves have a quadratic form. Thus, the approximate Maillet solution largely overestimates the duration of the 'influenced' stage and underestimates the dynamic volume of the aquifer. Moreover, only the Boussinesq equations enable correct estimates of the aquifer parameters.
   Numerical simulations of more realistic aquifers, with an impermeable floor much deeper than the outlet, proves the robustness of the Boussinesq formula even under conditions far from the simplifying assumptions that were used to integrate the diffusion equation. The quadratic form of recession is valid regardless of the thickness of the aquifer under the outlet, and provides good estimates of the aquifer's hydrodynamic parameters. Nevertheless, the same numerical simulations show that aquifers with a very deep floor provide an exponential recession. Thus, in that configuration, the Maillet formula also provides a good fit of recession curves, even if parameter estimation remains poor. In fact, the recession curve appears to be closer to exponential when flow has a very important vertical component, and closer to quadratic when horizontal flow is dominant. As a consequence, aquifer permeability anisotropy also changes the recession form.
   The combined use of the two fitting methods allows one to quantify the thickness of the aquifer under the outlet. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In a companion paper [Veneziano and Niemann, this issue] the authors have proposed self-similarity and multifractality conditions for fluvial erosion topography within basins and have shown that topographic surfaces with this property can evolve from a broad class of dynamic models. Here we use the same self-similarity and multifractality conditions to derive geomorphological scaling laws of hydrologic interest. We find that several existing relations should be modified, as they were obtained using definitions of the quantities involved or measurement techniques that are inappropriate under selfsimilarity. These relations include Hack's law, the power law decay of the distributions of contributing area and main channel length, the scaling of channel slope with contributing area, and the self-similarity condition for river courses. Most results are further generalized by replacing main stream flow length and drainage area with generic measures of basin size. The relations we obtain among properly measured topographic variables have simple universal exponents. For example, the exponent of Hack's law is 0.5, the exponent of the distribution of contributing area is -0.5, and the exponent of the distribution of main stream length is -1.0. We also suggest a stochastic condition of drainage network self-similarity that incorporates topological as well as geometric and hydrologic features and a reformulation of Horton's laws using drained area rather than stream order.

AB Runoff and baseflow estimates provide critical information on surface and groundwater flow dynamics, water resource availability, and water usage patterns for effective water resource planning and management. Developing a physical-based model at large spatial scales such as continental/global scales require extensive datasets, complex parameterization, and higher computational capacity. Recent advances in satellite datasets related to water cycle process modeling, on the other hand, involve less parameterization and more effective computation over larger spatial and finer temporal scales. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical flux in the water cycle that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy from satellite-based information by using complementary relationship (CR) concepts. Similarly, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission satellite datasets provide useful estimates of total water storage change over large spatial extents. GRACE datasets have been extensively used in groundwater storage change and groundwater depletion studies. However, the application of GRACE data products for estimating runoff and baseflow is limited. Therefore, in this study, we used a CR approach to estimate ET and a water balance method for estimating runoff and baseflow over the Conterminous United States (CONUS). We evaluated the CR-based water balance model (CR-GRACE) with United States Geological Survey (USGS) runoff datasets based on hydrologic unit code level-2 (HUC-2) basin boundaries. The CR-GRACE model estimated annual runoff values agreed with USGS runoff values with root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient values of 14.7 mm/month and 0.81, respectively. We also evaluated the CR-GRACE model with two well-known Land Surface Models (LSM), Noah-LSM and Variable Infiltration Capacity LSM (VIC-LSM), from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) database. The comparison results for baseflow estimates from the CR-GRACE model have improved over Noah-LSM and VIC-LSM model estimates with RMSE values of 62.16, 101.00, and 207.32 mm/year, respectively. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the CR-GRACE model to estimate runoff and baseflows with limited parameterization and datasets.

AB The Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model and X-ray computed tomography (CT) have been increasingly used in combination over the past decade to simulate water flow and chemical transport at pore scale in porous materials. Because of its limitation in resolution and the hierarchical structure of most natural soils, the X-ray CT tomography can only identify pores that are greater than its resolution and treats other pores as solid. As a result, the so-called solid phase in X-ray images may in reality be a grey phase, containing substantial connected pores capable of conducing fluids and solute. Although modified LB models have been developed to simulate fluid flow in such media, models for solute transport are relatively limited. In this paper, we propose a LB model for simulating solute transport in binary soil images containing permeable solid phase. The model is based on the single-relaxation time approach and uses a modified partial bounce-back method to describe the resistance caused by the permeable solid phase to chemical transport. We derive the relationship between the diffusion coefficient and the parameter introduced in the partial bounce-back method, and test the model against analytical solution for movement of a pulse of tracer. We also validate it against classical finite volume method for solute diffusion in a simple 2D image, and then apply the model to a soil image acquired using X-ray tomography at resolution of 30 mu m in attempts to analyse how the ability of the solid phase to diffuse solute at micron-scale affects the behaviour of the solute at macro-scale after a volumetric average. Based on the simulated results, we discuss briefly the danger in interpreting experimental results using the continuum model without fully understanding the pore-scale processes, as well as the potential of using pore-scale modelling and tomography to help improve the continuum models.

AB In the central highlands of Eritrea, the fractures derived as lineaments from digitally enhanced Landsat TM images are grouped based on their tectonic origins and relative ages into three major sets of geological structures, Set 1, Set 2 and Set 3. Set 1 comprises the oldest NNE-SSW and NW-SE trending tensile lineaments, Set 2 is N-S and WNW-ESE and Set 3 is NE-SW and ENE-WSW. Both Set 2 and Set 3 are conjugate shear fractures. Frequency of groundwater occurrence (producing wells close to fracture lineaments), well yield and distance or locations of welt data from the fractures are the main parameters considered in the analysis using geographic information systems (GIS). In the Set 2 and Set 3 shear fractures, welt yields at distances of 0-60 m to lineaments are low while welt yields at a distance of about 90-120 m away from the major lineaments are high. In the NNE-SSW fractures of Set 1, welt yields at distances of 0-60 m from the major fractures are high but much tower than the highest well yields in the shear fractures at about 90-120 m. The relationship between welt yield and distance to fracture lineaments in the three sets of fractures indicates that both of the shear fractures are hydrotectonically more significant than the tensile fractures. Of the shear fractures the N-S trending Set 2 lineaments are relatively the most important in terms of groundwater potential. The data summarized in a conceptual hydrotectonic model can be used as a working reference in selecting potential sites for future groundwater exploration in the region. Although drilling sites can be designed within the optimum distances, for example, 90 m distance, along the N-S trending fractures, supplementary detailed geophysical investigations should be carried out prior to drilling. The lineament analysis using GIS thus provides a means for scaling down target areas and design cost-effective and successful groundwater exploration programmes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB There has been an unsettling rise in the river contamination due to the climate change and anthropogenic activities. Last decades' research has immensely focussed on river basin water quality (WQ) prediction, risk assessment and pollutant classification techniques to design more potent management policies and advanced early warning system. The next challenge is dealing with water-related data as they are problematic to handle owing to their nonlinearity, nonstationary feature and vague properties due to the unpredictable natural changes, interdependent relationship, human interference and complexity. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown remarkable success and superiority to handle such data owing to their higher accuracy to deal with non-linear data, robustness, reliability, cost-effectiveness, problem-solving capability, decision-making capability, efficiency and effectiveness. AI models are the perfect tools for river WQ monitoring, management, sustainability and policymaking. This research reports the state of the art of various AI models implemented for river WQ simulation over the past two decades (2000-2020). Correspondingly, over 200 research articles are reviewed from the Web of Science journals. The survey covers the model structure, input variability, performance metrics, regional generalisation investigation and comprehensive assessments of AI models progress in river water quality research. The increasing contaminants, the lack of funding and the deficiency in data, numerous variables and unique data time series pattern based on the geological area have increased the need for river WQ monitoring and control even more. Hence, this is highly emphasising the involvement of AI models development which can deal with missing data, able to integrate the features of a black-box model and white-box models, benchmarked model and automated early warning system are few of many points need more research. Despite extensive research on WQ simulation using AI models, shortcomings remain according to the current survey, and several possible future research directions are proposed. Overall, this survey provides a new milestone in water resource engineering on the AI model implementation, innovation and transformation in surface WQ modelling with many formidable problems in different blossoming area and objectives to be achieved in the future.

AB Stable isotope ratios (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in precipitation not only show a certain response to climate change at different time scales, but also have strong linkages to extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones (hurricanes/typhoons). Typhoon activity in the coastal region of Southeast China is quite intense, bringing huge amounts of moisture; thus, contributing to extreme rainfall in this region. The existing isotope data in Southeast China is available on a monthly or daily temporal resolution, which is inadequate to study 1-2-day-long typhoon rainfall events at a particular location. In this study, hourly rainfall delta H-2 and delta O-18 data are collected for eight typhoon events from 2013 to 2017 in Fuzhou, Southeast China. The total correlation between delta H-2 and delta O-18 is obtained as delta H-2 = 7.41 delta O-18 + 0.81 (R-2 = 0.96, N = 220). All the eight typhoon events reveal a similar variability pattern in delta(18)Ovalues which can be divided into three stages. More positive delta O-18 values occur in the first and third stages, while the second stage is dominated by most negative delta O-18 values, exhibiting an inverted U-shaped pattern. The positive delta O-18 values during the first and third stages are governed by re-evaporation. The precipitation during the second stage has distinctly lower delta O-18 values than the weighted average delta O-18 of summer precipitation in Fuzhou. Some of these values are slightly lower than those of the water vapor over the Pacific Ocean's surface. No significant relationship is observed between precipitation delta O-18 and temperature as well as the amount of precipitation during the second stage. We hypothesize that the significant O-18-depletion is mainly caused by the 'rain shield effect', which refers to combination of large-scale convection, high condensation efficiency, and recycling of isotopically depleted vapor in rain shield areas leading to very negative delta O-18 values during typhoon system. These findings suggest the use of stable isotope ratios as important tracers of typhoon water.

AB Rill detachment is an important process in rill erosion. The rill detachment rate is the fundamental basis for determination of the parameters of a rill erosion model. In this paper, an analytical method was proposed to estimate the rill detachment rate. The method is based on the exact analytical solution of rill erosion to the differential equation of rill detachment. The rill sediment concentration distribution as a function of rill length was identified through laboratory experiments under different slope gradients and flow rates. The sediment concentration processes from experiments on loess and purple rills were considered to estimate the rill detachment rates of both soils analytically. They were respectively used as a function of rill length and sediment concentration. The analytical detachment rates were compared with the numerically determined values to verify the analytical methods. The rill detachment rates of the two soils under different flow rates and slope gradients estimated by the analytical method were further compared on the basis of detachment-sediment function and detachment-rill length function. Results indicated that the analytically estimated values were very close to the numerically estimated values. Numerical and analytical methods were equally useful for rill detachment rate estimation. Therefore, the analytical method was verified to be rational and applicable for the rapid determination of the rill detachment rates based on either sediment concentration or rill length. The analytical detachment values of purple and loess soils suggested that the detachment rates of loess soil were significantly and considerably higher than those of purple soil. The erosion potentials of loess soil were also significant higher than those of purple soil. The differences in the erosion of the two soils decreased as the slope gradient and flow rate increased. These observations implied that the degree of loess soil erosion was greater than that of purple soil erosion at low slope gradients and flow rates. The factors causing these differences may be determined in terms of the properties of the two soils. Therefore, the proposed analytical method, in addition to the concepts and direct relationship to erosion process, could be applied to obtain the rill detachment rate for the determination of rill erosion model parameters.

AB A paucity of studies on the interaction between environment and ground water recharge severely restricts the ability of people to assess future water resources under changing environment. In, this study, an effort to explore the relationship between the arid environment and ground water recharge was carried out using multivariate statistical techniques in a sedimentary drainage basin (the Jungar) in northwestern China. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed based on hydrogeochemical data to assess the ground water recharge and its governing factors. Observation of the HCA and PCA analytical results revealed a division of seven clusters (C1 to C7) and three principal components (PC1 to PC3), which explained 59.6%, 16.6% and 10.9% of the variance, respectively, and thus, accounted for the majority of the total variance in the original dataset. Based on these Q-mode HCA clusters and R-mode PAC scores, dominant environmental processes influencing recharge regimes were identified, i.e., geogenic, geomorphoclimatic, and anthropogenic, which separated the recharge regimes into four zones (Zone I to Zone IV). Zones I and II (C4 + C1) were associated to "elevated hydroclimate degree" coupled to "low salinity". Zone III (C2 + C3) was associated to "moderately elevated salinity" and evidently "elevated contamination" but coupled to "low hydroclimate degree". Zone IV (C5 + C6 + C7) was associated mainly to "elevated salinity" coupled to "low or inverse hydroclimate degree". It revealed that the geogenic processes are more significant (60%) than the geomorphoclimatic (17%) and anthropogenic (11%) processes. As a result, the overall recharge process is rather heterogeneous and is strongly environment dominated in the Jungar drainage system. Compared with other watersheds in arid environment, a distinctive feature of the Jungar waters is that they are affected by a combination of natural and non-natural events, rather than following a steady and continuous geological evolution. These will continue to influence the recharge regime of the Jungar for a long time due to its steady tectonics and arid climate. However, changing rainfall, but not snow, is becoming the key factor driving changes in ground water resources in this drainage system, as results of the decades of warming and humidification in northwestern China.

AB During a risk assessment procedure as well as when dealing with cleanup and monitoring strategies, accurate predictions of solute propagation in fractured rocks are of particular importance when assessing exposure pathways through which contaminants reach receptors.
   Experimental data obtained under controlled conditions such as in a laboratory allow to increase the understanding of the fundamental physics of fluid flow and solute transport in fractures.
   In this study, laboratory hydraulic and tracer tests have been carried out on an artificially created fractured rock sample. The tests regard the analysis of the hydraulic loss and the measurement of breakthrough curves for saline tracer pulse inside a rock sample of parallelepiped shape (0.60x0.40x0.08 m). The convolution theory has been applied in order to remove the effect of the acquisition apparatus on tracer experiments.
   The experimental results have shown evidence of a non-Darcy relationship between flow rate and hydraulic loss that is best described by Forchheimer's law. Furthermore, in the flow experiments both inertial and viscous flow terms are not negligible.
   The observed experimental breakthrough curves of solute transport have been modeled by the classical one-dimensional analytical solution for the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) and the single rate mobile-immobile model (MIM). The former model does not properly fit the first arrival and the tail while the latter, which recognizes the existence of mobile and immobile domains for transport, provides a very decent fit.
   The carried out experiments show that there exists a pronounced mobile-immobile zone interaction that cannot be neglected and that leads to a non-equilibrium behavior of solute transport. The existence of a non-Darcian flow regime has showed to influence the velocity field in that it gives rise to a delay in solute migration with respect to the predicted value assuming linear flow. Furthermore, the presence of inertial effects enhance non-equilibrium behavior. Instead, the presence of a transitional flow regime seems not to exert influence on the behavior of dispersion. The linear-type relationship found between velocity and dispersion demonstrates that for the range of imposed flow rates and for the selected path the geometrical dispersion dominates the mixing processes along the fracture network.

TI Stormflow generation in a humid forest watershed controlled by

AB Understanding the meanings and identifying the controls for the stormflow generation with complex and nonlinear behaviors is essential for the development of threshold-based hydrological theory, as well as accurate assessment and prediction for flash flood risks. However, the study of catchment emergent patterns with threelinear threshold behaviors associated with hydrological connectivity has received little attention. Therefore, utilizing soil water storage, rainfall, and streamflow data spanning 3 years in a humid forest experimental watershed, Dujiangyan city, China, we elucidated how and where stormflow was generated with nonlinear behaviors, which were affected by antecedent wetness and rainfall amounts. Stormflow threshold behavior was taken as a function of combined gross precipitation and antecedent soil water storage, which was isolated using piecewise regression analysis with the identification of two breakpoints (i.e., generation threshold, T-g and rising threshold, T-r). It was found that the initial emergent behavior of rainfall-runoff was generally activated at the T-g, and then an abrupt shift from slow to fast flood response was possibly triggered at the T-r. These processes are important to understand the formation and development of flash floods at the watershed scale. It was noted that, above the T-r, considerably higher stormflow amounts generally occurred due to the lateral-connectivity extension of runoff contributing area from stream to neighboring hillslopes. Meanwhile, gravity-driven water movements in soil and better hydrological connectivity during the above-T-r phase readily triggered the huge flash flood disasters. The above-T-r flash floods with abrupt shifts were predominantly controlled by rainfall amounts, while initial below-T-g stormflow generation was mainly controlled by unsaturated soil water storage. More noteworthy, under heavy rainstorm conditions, the above-T-r stormflow was dominantly generated by subsurface flow, as was demonstrated at hillslope and watershed scales. These findings contribute to increasing our understanding of the controls on three-linear threshold-based hydrological behaviors, as well as of subsurface stormflow generation mechanism associated with hydrological connectivity in humid forest watersheds.

AB The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of climate, soils, topography and vegetation control the water and energy balances among catchments. Two well-known hydrological theories underpinning these processes are the Budyko framework and the Dunne diagram. Relating the scaling of water-energy balances (Budyko) and runoff generation mechanisms (Dunne) raises some important catchment comparison questions, namely: (i) how do streamflow characteristics vary according to the annual water and energy balances?; (ii) to what extent do biophysical drivers of runoff explain the observed streamflow variability?; and (iii) are there quantifiable process overlaps between these two approaches, and can they offer insights into the mechanics of catchment co-evolution? This study addresses these questions by analysing daily streamflow and precipitation time series data to quantify hydrological similarity across 355 catchments located along a tropical-temperate climatic gradient in eastern Australia. We used eight hydrological metrics to describe the hydrological response over a 33-year period (1980-2013). Hierarchical cluster, ordination analysis, the Budyko framework, and generalized additive models were used to evaluate hydrological similarity, extract the dominant response, and examine how the landscape and climatic characteristics of catchments influence the dominant streamflow response. The catchments were classified into five clusters based on the analysis of their hydrological characteristics and similarity, which vary along the annual water and energy balances gradient in the Budyko framework. Furthermore, we show that the streamflow similarity is explained by six catchment-specific biophysical factors that overlap with those described by the Dunne diagram for runoff generation, which in this case have the following order of relative importance: (i) Dryness Index; (ii) Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation; (iii) Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity; (iv) Soil Depth; (v) Maximum Slope and (vi) Fraction of Woody Vegetation Cover. The research advances our understanding of the role of biophysical controls on hydrologic similarity and formal process links between the Budyko Framework and Dunne diagram of runoff mechanisms.

AB Extreme value analysis of drought indices was used to assess the likelihood of drought over the UK during the 20th century and potential future changes due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gasses. Precipitation indices were derived using 3, 6, 12 and 18 month accumulations, normalised by the 1961-1990 mean and standardized by the corresponding standard deviation. A soil moisture index, similarly standardized, was calculated from monthly soil moisture data Output from an 11-member perturbed physics ensemble of the Hadley Centre regional climate model (HadRM3), forced at the boundaries by equivalent versions of the Hadley Centre global climate model (HadCM3), was evaluated against available observational-based reference data Soil moisture reference data were derived from a distributed land surface scheme driven by meteorological reanalysis. Whilst the model ensemble underestimates the variability of the precipitation climatology in the reference data, it accurately replicates the extreme characteristics of dry months for the majority of the ensemble members. Differences in land surface characteristics and the representation of sub-grid scale heterogeneity means that there are significant differences in the representation of soil moisture between model and reference data. However, when HadRM3 is forced at the boundaries by ERA-40 reanalysis data the extreme characteristics of low soil moisture are replicated by the model ensemble indicating that using the regional climate model ensemble to downscale from the coarse resolution of HadCM3 is appropriate. Projections of drought for the 21st century were estimated by applying non-stationary extreme value theory to these monthly drought indices. All drought indices show an overall increase in drought in the future However, the spread of values is considerable ranging from little change or a slight decrease to a significant increase depending on ensemble member and, to a smaller extent, location The impact of these projections are put in the context of the notorious UK drought of the summer of 1976 This work provides preliminary steps towards a probabilistic assessment of changes in future drought.

TI A Muskingum-based methodology for river discharge estimation and rating
   curve development under significant lateral inflow conditions
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE River discharge; Rating curve; Lateral inflow; Prismatic channel
ID CHANNELS; FLOW; STAGE; MODEL
AB Quite often the discharge at a site is estimated using the rating curve developed for that site and its development requires river flow measurements, which are costly, tedious and dangerous during severe floods. To circumvent the conventional rating curve development approach, Perumal et al. in 2007 and 2010 applied the Variable Parameter Muskingum Stage-hydrograph (VPMS) routing method for developing stage-discharge relationships especially at those ungauged river sites where stage measurements and details of section geometry are available, but discharge measurements are not made. The VPMS method enables to estimate rating curves at ungauged river sites with acceptable accuracy. But the application of the method is subjected to the limitation of negligible presence of lateral flow within the routing reach. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an extension of the VPMS method, henceforth, known herein as the VPMS-L-in method, for enabling the streamflow assessment even when significant lateral inflow occurs along the river reach considered for routing. The lateral inflow is estimated through the continuity equation expressed in the characteristic form as advocated by Barbetta et al. in 2012.
   The VPMS-L-in, is tested on two rivers characterized by different geometric and hydraulic properties: 1) a 50 km reach of the Tiber River in (central Italy) and 2) a 73 km reach of the Godavari River in the peninsular India. The study demonstrates that both the upstream and downstream discharge hydrographs are well reproduced, with a root mean square error equal on average to about 35 and 1700 m(3) s(-1) for the Tiber River and the Godavari River case studies, respectively. Moreover, simulation studies carried out on a river stretch of the Tiber River using the one-dimensional hydraulic model MIKE11 and the VPMS-L-in models demonstrate the accuracy of the VMPS-L-in model, which besides enabling the estimation of streamflow, also enables the estimation of reach averaged optimal roughness coefficients for the considered routing events.

AB Satellite-based near-surface (0-2cm) soil moisture estimates have global coverage, but do not capture variations of soil moisture in the root zone (up to 100 cm depth) and may be biased with respect to ground-based soil moisture measurements. Here, we present an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) hydrologic data assimilation system that predicts bias in satellite soil moisture data to support the physically based Soil Moisture Analytical Relationship (SMAR) infiltration model, which estimates root zone soil moisture with satellite soil moisture data. The SMAR-EnKF model estimates a regional-scale bias parameter using available in situ data. The regional bias parameter is added to satellite soil moisture retrievals before their use in the SMAR model, and the bias parameter is updated continuously over time with the EnKF algorithm. In this study, the SMAR-EnKF assimilates in situ soil moisture at 43 Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) monitoring locations across the conterminous U.S. Multivariate regression models are developed to estimate SMAR parameters using soil physical properties and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) evapotranspiration data product as covariates. SMAR-EnKF root zone soil moisture predictions are in relatively close agreement with in situ observations when using optimal model parameters, with root mean square errors averaging 0.051 [cm(3) cm(-3)] (standard error, s.e. = 0.005). The average root mean square error associated with a 20-fold cross-validation analysis with permuted SMAR parameter regression models increases moderately (0.082 [cm(3) cm(-3)], s.e. =.0.004). The expected regional-scale satellite correction bias is negative in four out of six ecoregions studied (mean = -0.12 [-], s.e. = 0.002), excluding the Great Plains and Eastern Temperate Forests (0.053 [-1], s.e. = 0.001). With its capability of estimating regional-scale satellite bias, the SMAR-EnKF system can predict root zone soil moisture over broad extents and has applications in drought predictions and other operational hydrologic modeling purposes.

AB Artificial subsurface drainage provides an avenue for the rapid transfer of phosphorus (P) from agricultural fields to surface waters. This is of particular interest in eastern Wisconsin, where there is a concentrated population of dairy farms and high clay content soils prone to macropore development. Through collaboration with private landowners, surface and tile drainage was measured and analyzed for dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total P (TP) losses at four field sites in eastern Wisconsin between 2005 and 2009. These sites, which received frequent manure applications, represent a range of crop management practices which include: two chisel plowed corn fields (CP1, CP2), a no-till corn-soybean field (NT), and a grazed pasture (GP). Subsurface drainage was the dominant pathway of water loss at each site accounting for 66-96% of total water discharge. Average annual flow-weighted (FW) TP concentrations were 0.88, 0.57, 0.21, and 1.32 mg L-1 for sites CP1, CP2, NT, and GP, respectively. Low TP concentrations at the NT site were due to tile drain interception of groundwater flow where large volumes of tile drainage water diluted the FW-TP concentrations. Subsurface pathways contributed between 17% and 41% of the TP loss across sites. On a drainage event basis, total drainage explained between 36% and 72% of the event DRP loads across CP1, CP2, and GP; there was no relationship between event drainflow and event DRP load at the NT site. Manure applications did not consistently increase P concentrations in drainflow, but annual FW-P concentrations were greater in years receiving manure applications compared to years without manure application. Based on these field measures, P losses from tile drainage must be integrated into field level P budgets and P loss calculations on heavily manured soils, while also acknowledging the unique drainage patterns observed in eastern Wisconsin.

AB Changes in hydrological inputs to the flood-pulsed Okavango Delta result in changes in such flooding characteristics as floodplain water depth, inundation duration and frequency. A mathematical model is used to assess impacts of changing hydrological inputs on flooding in the Okavango Delta. Future conditions are simulated by superimposing simulated abstractions, upstream developments and climate change effects on the observed time series of hydrological inputs. The effects of change in inputs are then determined by comparing hydrological characteristics such as inundation duration and frequency derived from the original and modified time series of model outputs. Simulations show that upstream abstractions are likely to have small short-term effects on the flooding pattern in the Delta, while other upstream developments such as damming or deforestation have more pronounced effects. All of these effects are relatively small, however, when compared to changes resulting from existing climatic variability, and those from the possible effects of future climate change. The combined effects of human abstraction and climate change, manifested as increased temperatures, decreased rainfall, and reduction in river flows, may result in significant Delta drying. The simulated hydrological changes affect the Delta floodplain ecosystems, with anticipated changes in the area and proportions of permanent swamp, areas covered by sedge and grass vegetation (seasonal flood-plains) and floodplain grasslands (intermittently flooded areas). These will have varied effects on ecological processes in the Delta, in particular vegetative succession, primary production, and relationships of floodplains with the surrounding woodland and savannah. Additional ripple effects up trophic levels can also be expected. There may also be downstream impacts on tourist facilities presently on the fringes of the seasonal swamps as a result of reduced or increased flooding. As a result of altered flood regime, some effects are also anticipated with respect to the recharge of aquifers, which are currently used for drinking water supply around the Delta.

AB A significant volume of research over the past two decades has highlighted both direct and indirect links between climate change and groundwater quality. However, to date, few studies have sought to explore the relationship (s) between drought conditions and groundwater quality in i) private (unregulated) groundwater sources, or ii) temperate maritime climates not commonly prone to drought events. The Republic of Ireland (ROI) represents an appropriate case-study due to its' high reliance on private groundwater supplies, and while the region is largely unaffected by climatological extremes, modelling studies indicate that drier summers and drought conditions will increase in frequency. Accordingly, the current study sought to quantify the effects of the Summer 2018 drought experienced throughout Europe on private groundwater quality in the southwest of Ireland via an opportunistic field study. A repeated measures sampling campaign comprised of "drought" (June/July) and "post-drought" (October/November) analyses of 74 wells was undertaken, with complementary mapping and statistical analyses. Both Total Coliforms (TCs) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were present during both drought (TCs: 42/74; 56.8%, E. coli: 7/74; 9.5%) and post-drought (TCs: 42/74; 56.8%, E. coli: 18/74; 24.3%) sampling periods. E. coli contamination during drought conditions was unexpected due to an absence of recharge or infiltration for microbial transport. Bivariate analyses suggest a hydrodynamic change, with the significance of E. coli sources and pathways shown to switch between sampling periods i.e. a shift from a combination of regional and local (site specific) contamination mechanisms, to solely site-specific mechanisms. More specifically, during drought conditions, septic tank density (p = 0.001) and local subsoil type (p = 0.009) were both associated with the presence of E. coli, while neither variable was significant during post-drought conditions. The current study is the first to provide a quantitative comparison of private groundwater quality during and after a large-scale drought event in a temperate maritime climate and may be used to improve our understanding of the effects of extreme events, and thus necessary preventative and monitoring strategies, going forward.

ID STATION PRECIPITATION MODEL; PREDICTION; RAINDROPS; CLOUD
AB A physically based rainfall forecasting model for real-time hydrologic applications is developed with emphasis on utilization of remote sensing observations.  Temporal and spatial scales of interest are lead times of the order of hours and areas of the order of 10 km2.  The dynamic model is derived from conservation of mass in a cloud column as defined by the continuity equations for air, liquid water, water vapor, and cloud water.  Conservation of momentum is modeled using a semi-Lagrangian frame of reference.  The model state is vertically integrated liquid water content in a column of the atmosphere.  Additionally, laws of thermodynamics, adiabatic air parcel theory, and cloud microphysics are applied to derive a basic parameterization of the governing equations of model dynamics.  The parameterization is in terms of hydrometeorologic observables including radar reflectivity, satellite-infrared brightness temperature, and ground-level air temperature, dew point temperature, and pressure.  Implementation and application is described by French et al. (this issue) and involves incorporation of uncertainty analysis and a two-dimensional spatial domain, where the dynamics of the continuous space-time rainfall process are discretized onto a rectangular grid.

AB This work presents a methodology for soil wetness monitoring over the Peace Athabasca Delta, PAD, a northern watershed located in the Mackenzie River Basin in North-Western Canada The approach is based on the use of a combination of passive microwave data from AMSR-E instrument, data in the visible wavelengths from MODIS sensor and topographic attributes derived from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model. Classic topography-based wetness indices are static and unable to capture the temporal variability of soil moisture Also, they do not account for vegetation effect on the spatial organisation of soil wetness. We therefore suggest overcoming these limitations by assessing the temporal variability of soil wetness using passive microwave data and introducing vegetation parameters into a new topography-based wetness index (TWI) The proposed approach is an improvement in a dynamic sense over classic topographic indices. It also distinguishes between wetness and open waterbodies contributions to the passive microwave signal. AMSR-E 37 GHz data have been used to regularly assess total soil wetness in the PAD. MODIS images have been used to develop a rating curve relationship between discharge observations and the extent of flooded areas. A basin wetness index (BWI) has been calculated as the difference between total wetness fraction from AMSR-E and inundated surface fraction retrieved from MODIS images. The new topographic wetness index disaggregates BWI values and distinguishes between inundated areas and wet soils responses in the passive microwave signal. Results were compared to those derived from the classic and static index. The proposed index has provided a better estimation of the wetness over the basin with respect to the classic wetness index The correlation coefficients between the disaggregated wetness Index and observed precipitations at Fort Chipewayn A station were 0.7 and 0.69 for 2003 and 2002 respectively. The obtained map of waterbodies in the delta which is the result of the downscaling process agrees well with a Landsat image as the determined probability of detection was equal to 0.7. This implies that a combination of passive microwave data and topographic attributes has an interesting potential to improve the water balance closure over northern basins. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Transpiration dynamics of karst ecosystems are not conditioned only by the shallow-soil water status, mainly because of the presence of deep-water source pools formed within the underlying bedrock if trees can develop their deep roots to the pools. However, the strength of these relationships and how as well as why they can vary from an area to another and from season to season are poorly understood, due primarily to high heterogeneity of karst ecosystems. Therefore, the present study was conducted during 2018-2019 rainy and dry seasons in a subtropical (limestone) karst area on southwest China to explore the functional responses to reduced water availability of evergreen Ligustrum lucidum (Chinese glossy privet) growing on the shallow soils. Seasonal variations in the transpiration, water-use patterns, and water sources were investigated for Ligustrum lucidum through high-resolution monitoring of the micrometeorology, sap flow, and soil moisture data, in combination with the carbon stable isotope composition of the tree leaves, as well as oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition of the tree stem, soil, and deep water. Our findings showed that high transpiration rates of Ligustrum lucidum were mainly associated with the soil moisture during rainy seasons (87% in total) but the low rates were associated primarily with the deep-water sources during dry seasons (13% in total). During the rainy season, when plenty of water was available to the plant, Ligustrum lucidum tended to obtain water inexpensively through the soil layers (on average, 59%) and consumed it profligately through reduction of its water use efficiency (WUEi) (mean WUEi rainy-season = 82.6 mu mol/mol). In contrast, during the dry season, when limited water was available to the plant resulting from the significant reduction in rainfall, Ligustrum lucidum had to obtain the water expensively (albeit at a small amount) through deep-water source pools (on average, 62%), and consumed it conservatively through increasing its WUEi (mean WUEi (rainy-season) = 108.6 mu mol/mol). Our findings can provide the insights into temporal transpiration dynamics as well as the strategies and mechanisms adopted by the plants to counteract the seasonal drought stress associated with the shallow soils in karst ecosystems.

AB This article aims to provide an on the spot, handy field tool that can be used in estimating the Saturation Index with respect to calcite in karst aquifers in a limestone context. It relies on an abacus that gives the SIc by using measured pH and bicarbonate concentration as coordinates.
   The analytical expressions of the carbonate equilibrium equations are derived in order to calculate SIc from values that can be measured on field. Using these established relationships, we propose an Abacus built from the SIc = f(Pco(2)eq) reference frame, hence called SIc-Abacus.
   Accuracy of SIc calculation is also discussed. SIc is calculated with values measured considering uncertainty coming from pH ( +/- 0.05 pH units), temperature ( +/- 0.1 degrees C), bicarbonate and calcium concentrations ( +/- 2.5 mg/L and +/- 2 mg/L). This gives, for each sample, a range of possible SIc values of +/- 0.060 pH units (for a bicarbonate concentration close to 300 mg/L). The effect on SIc range of possible values given by bicarbonate and calcium uncertainties is about 10 times lower than the effect brought by pH uncertainty. Also, bicarbonate and calcium concentration can be estimated from electrical conductivity leading to a possible range of SIc value of +/- 0.087 pH units. In both cases, the range of possible values of SIc varies according to the bicarbonate concentration.
   Using Cussac and Lascaux sites, an evaluation was done. Results show the goodness of fit (R-2 = 0.96) between the calculated SIc from measured pH, bicarbonate and calcium concentration and the estimated SIc values generated from the SIc-Abacus. Apart from calculating SIc, another method which is an alternative use of the generated SIc equation focused on obtaining pH using parameters such as electrical conductivity and dissolved CO2 measurements is presented.
   The study shows that SIc-Abacus can be a new in-situ tool for karst aquifer surveys. It can facilitate in making a swift decision that tackles carbonate karst issues (e.g. when selecting sites or in deciding if extensive monitoring should be performed or not based from a specific objective).

AB Data assimilation (DA) has emerged as a valuable tool for the design and application of streamflow forecasting systems. But DA applications for streamflow simulations in ungauged basins are still very limited primarily because most updated ensemble members are not usually associated with converged state and model parameterizations. Other limitations include the evaluation of massive number of ensemble members, weak/unknown relationships between parameter values and predictors, and the transfer of several members from gauged watersheds to ungauged ones is computationally expensive. But the inherent dynamics of DA to account for uncertainties in model, forcing data, and imperfect observation provide an appealing approach to simulate watershed response in ungauged basins. This study proposes a DA method namely the Pareto-Particle-Ensemble Kalman Filter (ParetoParticleEnKF) to generate and archive a small number of continuously evolved members using multi-objective evolutionary strategy where these members are updated using particle and ensemble Kalman filtering methods. The archived members for gauged watersheds are combined using inverse distance weighting where they are applied to simulate watershed response in ungauged basins.
   The proposed method is demonstrated by assimilating daily streamflow into the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model for 10 watersheds in southern Ontario, Canada. After successfully transferring ensemble members from gauged watersheds to ungauged ones, the updated ensembles were applied to simulate streamflow for up to 10-days ahead to determine how long into the future would the quality/accuracy of simulations persist before they begin to deteriorate in the ungauged basin. The results show that the designed method can facilitate simulation of accurate streamflows for any time step, and generate accurate simulations for up to 10 days ahead in the ungauged basins. A unique evaluation procedure is the transfer of updated members in the form of forcing data uncertainties, and state and model parameterizations from gauged to ungauged watersheds and their subsequent assessment for multiple time step ahead simulations. The overall decline in accuracy from gauged to ungauged watersheds for the entire 10-day lead time across all 10 watersheds is 20% for Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and 12% for percent bias.

AB The high dimensionality of predictor variables reduces the predictive accuracy of statistical downscaling models. Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the extensively used approaches for reducing the dimensionality of the predictors. However, PCA reduces the efficiency of downscaling models when a nonlinear predictor-predictand relationship exists. To solve this issue, the representative grid location (RGL) approach was used to minimise the dimension of the predictor variables. Thus, a novel RGL-MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline) based downscaling model was proposed in the current study. The proposed model was compared with PCA-MLR (Principal Component Analysis-Multiple Linear Regression), MARS, and PCA-MARS downscaling methods. Eight general circulation models (GCMs) were considered, out of which only CAN-ESM2 (second-generation Canadian Earth System Model) GCM was found suitable for the study area. Three criteria, i.e., correlation coefficient (CC), mutual information (MI), and decision tree (DT), were used for the selection of dominant predictors. It was observed that CMD (CC + MI + DT) predictors, when used with the RGL-MARS downscaling method, showed the best performance (NSE = 74-89%; root mean square error (RMSE) = 10-40 mm). The results revealed that rainfall simulated by the RGL-MARS model captured the standard deviation and coefficient of variation in the observed rainfall, whereas the rest failed to do so. The RGL-MARS model solved the issue of underprediction of wet season rainfall and overprediction of dry season rainfall. The RGL-MARS addressed the issue with an improved NSE of 62-89% and RMSE of 18-45 mm; thus, the result exhibited that integration of MARS with the RGL perform better compared to the PCA.. This study also demonstrated that downscaling model outcomes were more reliable for the wet than the dry season. The future rainfall projection indicated that the rainfall fluctuation might be more in the dry season than the wet season. The proposed downscaling method can improve the accuracy of rainfall projections under various climatic conditions, subsequently, coupled with a range of hydrological and land surface models to better understand the catchment characteristics and the water balance dynamics in future climate studies.

AB Vegetation restoration is widely recognized as the most effective measure in controlling runoff and soil erosion under different climatic zones and topographical conditions. Nevertheless, few studies have been performed to quantify its effectiveness in controlling runoff and soil erosion on steep gully slopes in arid and semi-arid regions. This study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of vegetation restoration in controlling runoff and soil erosion and further identify its main factors influencing runoff and soil erosion under typical plant communities on steep gully slopes of the Loess Plateau, China. Runoff and erosion were analyzed on monthly scale from 14 micro-plots for three consecutive years (2018-2020). The results showed that vegetation restoration can effectively reduce runoff and erosion. Compare to bare land, runoff and erosion reduced by 37.5% to 93.0% and 83.9% to 99.6% under different plant communities. The mean percent runoff and soil erosion reduction and the ratio of percent runoff reduction to percent erosion reduction of shrub community were 1.34, 1.06, and 1.29 times those of grass community. The corresponding values of grass community with tap root systems were 0.60, 0.91, and 0.64 times that with fibrous mot systems. Shrub community was more effective than grass community in reducing erosion, whereas grass community (especially with tap root systems) was more effective in maintaining runoff. Although runoff and erosion varied greatly between different plant communities, their relationships could be well simulated by power functions. Variations in runoff were primarily affected by rainfall amount, the maximum 30-minute intensity, 60-minute rainfall kinetic energy, litter coverage, and biological crust coverage. Variations in erosion were dominantly influenced by runoff, the maximum 30-minute intensity, plant canopy coverage, and litter density. Overall, our study suggested that grass community (especially with tap root systems) is likely a more suitable and advisable choice for vegetation restoration on steep gully slope in arid and semiarid regions. The results of this study provide the scientific guide for policy-making of vegetation restoration on steep gully slopes in arid and semi-arid regions, i.e. the Loess Plateau.

AB River sediment flux, the most critical element of land-ocean interaction, is undergoing significant changes due to climate variability and anthropogenic activities. Thus, identifying the driving forces and their contributions to the variation in sediment load is of great significance for sustainable management of soil and water resources. However, the dynamics behind these changes are not well understood, and the quantification of drivers of sediment load change remains scarce. In this study, we investigated the changes in hydrometeorological variables and quantitatively separated drivers of sediment load change in the Yangtze River (YZR) basin, China, during 1956-2015. The Mann-Kendall test and sequential cluster method were employed to examine the trends and abrupt changes in water discharge and sediment load. Results showed that the mean annual precipitation for most sub-basins and water discharge at most stations exhibited no apparent downward trend, while annual temperature showed a significant upward trend for most sub-basins. Sediment load decreased significantly at most stations, with breakpoints occurring around 1968 and in the early 2000s. The whole study period was split into three sub-periods (1956-1968, 1969-2002 and 2003-2015) to quantify the change in sediment load. As indicated by water-sediment relationships at 12 stations, the slope of the double mass curve showed a considerable decreasing trend during the period 2003-2015. A decomposition method based on sediment identity factor analysis was applied to quantify the impact of driving forces on the variation in sediment load. It was found that a decrease in suspended sediment concentration accounted for approximately 100-125% of the basin-wide reduction in sediment load in the YZR basin. Construction of large reservoirs played a dominant role in sharp decline in sediment load across the basin, which was responsible for about 157 Mt yr(-1) and 384 Mt yr(-1) of sedimentation for the period 1969-2002 and 2003-2015, respectively. Soil conservation projects played the secondary role in reducing sediment load, which led to an average decrease of 234 Mt yr(-1) in the entire basin during 1989-2015. Hence, more attention should be paid to changes in sediment load resulting from increasing human activities in the future.

AB The stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) has been demonstrated to be a useful indicator of environmental conditions occurring during plant growth. Previous studies suggest that tree leaf delta C-13 is correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) over a broad range of climates with precipitation between 100 and 2000 mm/year. However, this relationship confirmed at the large scale may not be present at the local scale with complex terrain where factors other than precipitation may lead to additional variability in plant water stress. In this study, we investigated delta C-13 of tree leaves in a native vegetation catchment over a local gradient of hydro-climatic conditions induced by two hillslopes with opposite aspects. Significant seasonal variations, calculated as a difference between the maximum and minimum delta C-13 values for each tree, were observed for two species, up to 1.9 parts per thousand for Eucalyptus (E.) paniculata, and up to 2.7 parts per thousand for Acacia (A.) pycnantha on the north-facing slope (NFS). Also the mean delta C-13 values calculated from all investigated trees of each hillslope were significantly different and leaf delta C-13 on the NFS was higher by 1.4 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand than that on the south-facing slope (SFS). These results cannot be explained by the negligible difference in precipitation between the two hillslopes located just 200 m apart. The correlation coefficients between the delta C-13 of E. tree leaves and the integrated aridity index (AI) were statistically significant for temporal observations on the NFS (R-2 0.18-0.44, p-value 0.00-0.06), and spatial observations (R-2 = 0.35, p-value 0.05) at the end of the dry season. These results suggest that AI as a measure of plant water stress is better associated with leaf delta C-13 than precipitation. Therefore, leaf delta C-13 value can be used as a valuable proxy for plant water stress across the landscape in both time and space. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate monitoring of the surface water storage as an essential component of the global water cycle requires a realistic representation of river networks and channel characteristics. Since such a representation has not been available for many rivers and is becoming less available even for many gauged rivers, crucial questions about the spatio-temporal dynamics of freshwater in river networks cannot be answered properly.The global coverage and fine temporal resolution of satellite imagery provide the opportunity to obtain time series of surface water extent at the global scale for almost all rivers. However, despite recent advances in satellite imaging sensors, water extraction algorithms, and big data processing capabilities, none of the available global water extent data sets can meet the necessary requirements in terms of accuracy and spatio-temporal resolutions. Due to the inherent complexity of monitoring the river surface extent, efforts have been limited to the development of global river extent data sets with a limited number of temporal layers usually obtained from long-term averaged satellite imagery.In this study, we propose a region-based image restoration algorithm to obtain the river surface extent from a pre-existing global inland water data set by incorporating temporal and spatial constraints between pixel labels. We employ our algorithm on the Monthly Water History maps of the Global Surface Water data set (Pekel et al., 2016). We validate the proposed method on 98 river reaches that their average width ranges from approximately 36 m to 3400 m with in situ discharge measurements in the Mississippi, Amazon, Niger and Po river basins. The obtained river width time series exhibit a strong monotonic relationship with discharge measurements as the Spearman correlation coefficients are predominantly larger than 0.70 (on average 0.74 for Mississippi, 0.84 for Amazon, 0.86 for Niger and 0.77 for Po rivers). Such a performance confirms that the proposed method can facilitate the acquisition of a global dynamic river extent data set, which plays a key role in better understanding the distribution and availability of freshwater across continents.

AB Irrigated agriculture has been identified as using approximately 72% of water globally. Australia, like many places in the world, is subject to water sharing plans that cross government boarders and are subject to a mixture of management policies. There is a pressing need to develop a method to monitor irrigation water use to aid in water resource assessments and monitoring. This paper aims to test a method previously developed which monitors irrigation water use using remotely sensed observations over the catchment scale, without the need for in-situ observations, ground data or in-depth knowledge of crops and their planting dates. Using conservative assumptions about agricultural land management practice, irrigation is calculated as Irr = AET - P. The method uses three vegetation indices derived from Landsat images to calculate crop coefficients (K-c) based on multiple published relationships. These are combined through the FAO56 methodology using gridded rainfall and two reference evapotranspiration (ETo) products to find actual evapotranspiration as AET = ETo x K-c, providing six ETo-K-c combinations. Results indicate this study method can effectively assess irrigation water use over a range of catchment sizes from similar to 6000 to similar to 600,000 ha, although issues arise when regions have a designated low allocation volume for that season (less than40%). Comparisons with the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) show that the proposed method is robust to the rapid onset and short-term droughts, However, its performance was poor during the long term droughts with low water allocation years. The study results during these years has been predominately attributed to water stress in certain crops being undetected, agricultural managers skipping annual crop commodities as well as stock and domestic water use making up larger portions of total water use. This is a limitation of this approach, although when only comparing results in years with greater than 40% allocations, the results improved significantly showing it can monitor water use effectively. When adequate water is available, this approach is able to accurately predict irrigation water use for the sites examined.

AB Measuring ice contents (theta(i)) in partially frozen soils is important for both engineering and environmental applications. Thermo-time domain reflectometry (thermo-TDR) probes can be used to determine theta(i), based on the relationship between theta(i), and soil heat capacity (C). This approach, however, is accurate in partially frozen soils only at temperatures below -5 degrees C, and it performs poorly on clayey soils. In this study, we present and evaluate a soil thermal conductivity (lambda)-based approach to determine theta(i), with thermo-TDR probes. Bulk soil lambda is described with a simplified de Vries model that relates lambda to theta(i). From this model, theta(i); is estimated using inverse modeling of thermo-TDR measured lambda. Soil bulk density (rho(b)) and thermo-TDR measured liquid water content (theta(i)) are also needed for both C-based and lambda-based approaches. A theoretical analysis is performed to quantify the sensitivity of C-based and lambda-based theta(i) estimates to errors in these input parameters. The analysis indicates that the lambda-based approach is less sensitive to errors in the inputs (C, lambda, theta(i), and rho(b)) than is the C-based approach when the same or the same percentage errors occur. Further evaluations of the C-based and theta(i)-based approaches are made using experimentally determined theta(i), at different temperatures on eight soils with various textures, total water contents, and rho(b). The results show that the lambda-based thermo-TDR approach significantly improves the accuracy of theta(i) measurements at temperatures <=-5 degrees C. The root mean square errors of lambda-based theta(i), estimates are only half those of C-based theta(i). At temperatures of -1 and -2 degrees C, the lambda-based thermo-TDR approach also provides reasonable theta(i), while the C-based approach fails. We conclude that the lambda-based thermo-TDR method can reliably determine theta(i), even at temperatures near the freezing point of water (0 degrees C). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A model of catchment-scale nitrate transport is presented for a small, rural headwater basin (Alton Pancras: <10 km(2)) in Dorset, UK, for the period 1930-2007. Estimates of annual nitrogen (N) loading were based on parish land-use data, held in the UK's National Archives, and previously reported figures of typical UK N loadings from livestock, fertiliser, ploughing of permanent pasture, atmospheric deposition, biological fixation and crop uptake. Loading calculations were performed within an uncertainty framework to allow for the reliance on literature data sources. Loading calculations show that all significant sources must be included not just fertiliser application which, at most, contributes 50% of N input in any given year. A simple algorithm was used to transform estimated catchment N loading (1930-2007) into a river nitrate response (observed data: 1980-2004). This assumed N-loads were delayed by some catchment mean travel time (MIT), t(a), attenuated according to a Peclet number, P-e, converted into solute concentrations by a factor, alpha, to increase some initial baseline river concentration, C-b. Simple graphical translation of estimated catchment N loading to the river concentration data suggested a MIT of around 37 years. As P-e - infinity, the transport model simplified to a linear relationship between catchment N load and river nitrate concentration response lagged by the MTT. Hence, the model results suggest that, in this catchment, advection is the dominant mechanism for transport of diffuse pollution from land to river: there is little or no dispersion present. The MIT (t(a)) was then reconsidered using an estimated distribution of unsaturated zone depths in the Alton Pancras catchment. Conclusions suggest that, in modelling of long-term nutrient transport, a detailed source term is of much greater importance than a complex hydrogeological model. Implications of epistemic uncertainty, long-term prediction and management of diffuse agricultural pollution are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aeolian sand-covered loess slope of the Wind-Water Erosion Crisscross Region of the Loess Plateau in China may play a key role in contributing excessive sediment to the Yellow River. Understanding its hydro-erosional processes is crucial to assessing, controlling and predicting soil and water losses in this region and maintaining the ecological sustainability of the Yellow River. Simulated rainfall (intensity 90 mm h-1) was used to investigate the runoff and soil loss from loess slopes with different slope gradients (18%, 27%, 36%, 47%, and 58%) and overlying sand layer thicknesses (0, 5 and 10 cm). As compared with uncovered loess slopes, an overlying sand layer delayed runoff production, reduced cumulative runoff and increased cumulative soil loss, as well as enhancing variations among slope gradients. Cumulative runoff and soil loss from the sand-covered loess slopes increased with increasing slope gradients and then slightly decreased, with a peak at about 47% gradient; they both were greater from the 10-cm sand-covered loess slope than from the 5-cm except for with 18% slope gradient. In general, differences in cumulative runoff between sand layer thicknesses became smaller, while those in cumulative soil loss became larger, with increasing slope gradient. Runoff and soil loss rates on the sand-covered loess slopes exhibited unimodal distributions during the rainstorms. Maximum values tended to occur at the same rain duration, and increased considerably with increasing slope gradient and sand layer thickness on slopes that were less than 47%. Liquefaction process might occur on the lower loess slopes covered with thinner sand layers but failures similar to shallow landslides might occur when the sand layer was thicker on steeper slopes. The presence of an overlying sand layer changed the relationship between runoff and soil loss rates during intense rainstorms and this change varied with different slope gradients. Our results demonstrated that the effects of slope gradient on hydro-erosional processes on the sand-covered loess slopes were important and vary with changing sand thickness. These effects should be considered when assessing and predicting soil losses from such slopes in the study region and from similar slopes elsewhere. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An extensive statistical 'downscaling' study is done to relate large-scale climate information from a general circulation model (GCM) to local-scale river flows in SW France for 51 gauging stations ranging from nival (snow-dominated) to pluvial (rainfall-dominated) river-systems. This study helps to select the appropriate statistical method at a given spatial and temporal scale to downscale hydrology for future climate change impact assessment of hydrological resources. The four proposed statistical downscaling models use large-scale predictors (derived from climate model outputs or reanalysis data) that characterize precipitation and evaporation processes in the hydrological cycle to estimate summary flow statistics. The four statistical models used are generalized linear (GLM) and additive (GAM) models, aggregated boosted trees (ABT) and multi-layer perceptron neural networks (ANN). These four models were each applied at two different spatial scales, namely at that of a single flow-gauging station (local downscaling) and that of a group of flow-gauging stations having the same hydrological behaviour (regional downscaling). For each statistical model and each spatial resolution, three temporal resolutions were considered, namely the daily mean flows, the summary statistics of fortnightly flows and a daily 'integrated approach'. The results show that flow sensitivity to atmospheric factors is significantly different between nival and pluvial hydrological systems which are mainly influenced, respectively, by shortwave solar radiations and atmospheric temperature. The non-linear models (i.e. GAM, ABT and ANN) performed better than the linear GLM when simulating fortnightly flow percentiles. The aggregated boosted trees method showed higher and less variable R-2 values to downscale the hydrological variability in both nival and pluvial regimes. Based on GCM cnrm-cm(3) and scenarios A2 and A1B, future relative changes of fortnightly median flows were projected based on the regional downscaling approach. The results suggest a global decrease of flow in both pluvial and nival regimes, especially in spring, summer and autumn, whatever the considered scenario. The discussion considers the performance of each statistical method for downscaling flow at different spatial and temporal scales as well as the relationship between atmospheric processes and flow variability.

   Variational autoencoder; Harmonious evaluation; Yellow River

AB Climate change has increased the intensity and frequency of storms in many world regions, calling for new flood planning and management strategies. The concept of flood drainage rights (FDR), or the legal rights of regions to drain floodwaters into river reaches, is used in watershed planning in China. Quantifying the allocation of FDR remains challenging, where some previous methods have resulted in unreasonable or impractical allocation plans due to incomplete consideration of driving factors or the use of unscientific allocation methods. This study ex-plores the allocation plan of FDR in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River Watershed in China. Climatic variability and change have caused frequent flooding in portions of the basin, with significant societal and economic implications. First, we comprehensively analyzed factors driving FDR for regions in the watershed. Following the conceptual flood resilience strategy currently being advocated for the region, we considered natural, socioeconomic, governance, resilience, and resistance factors that influence the complex allocation of FDR and established a qualitative indicator system to reflect the complexity of these driving factors. Second, we quantified FDR values for flood-prone regions in the middle and lower river reaches of this major river basin. We introduced a specific deep learning method, called the variational autoencoder (VAE) model, to quantify FDR allocation, providing a robust solution to the challenge of the multi-objective, high-dimensional, nonlinear, and non-normal distribution of factors driving FDR allocation. Next, using data from 2005 to 2019, this model was applied to the study area. The allocation of FDR (summing to 100%) across five flood-prone provinces of the watershed includes Inner Mongolia (9.36%), Shaanxi (10.00%), Shanxi (10.95%), Henan (32.58%), and Shan-dong (37.12%). Using the harmony evaluation method based on harmony theory, we compared the new VAE allocation method with three conventional allocation methods. The VAE allocation method has the highest degree of harmony, suggesting that it is the most practical for FDR allocation and is a reasonable allocation for flood management. Such FDR can work with water conservancy engineering facilities as part of a comprehensive management system toward protecting public health, minimizing economic losses, and preserving functions of development and natural lands within floodplains of the Yellow River.

AB The relationships between forest stand structure, growth and evaporation were analysed to determine whether forest evaporation can be estimated from stand growth data. This approach permits rapid assessment of the potential impacts of afforestation on the water regime. The basis for this approach is (a) that growth rates are determined by water availability and limited by the maximum water extraction potential, and (b) that stand evaporation is proportional to biomass and biomass increment. The relationships between stand growth and evaporation were modelled for a set of catchment experiments where estimates of both growth and evaporation were available. The predicted mean evaporation, over periods of several years, was generally within 10% of the measured mean annual evaporation (rainfall minus streamflow) when the model from one catchment was applied to other catchments planted with the same species. The residual evaporation, after fitting the models, was correlated with rainfall: above-average rainfall resulted in above-average evaporation. This relationship could be used to derive estimates for dry and wet years. Analyses using the models provide additional evidence that Eucalyptus grandis may be depleting groundwater reserves in catchments where its roots can reach the water table. The models are designed to be integrated into a plantation management system which uses a geographic information system for spatial analysis and modelling. The use of readily available growth parameters as predictor variables may reduce our dependence on intricate process-based models. This is seen as an efficient way of extrapolating existing catchment data - reflecting the impacts of forestry on water supplies across a range of sites, climatic zones and species. This approach has the potential for further development, especially in dealing with low flows and faster growing species. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB While extreme rainfall events may provide rare opportunities for replenishment of surface water and groundwater resources in vulnerable (semi)arid areas, they are typically also associated with widespread flooding. The impacts on contaminant movement associated with spatio-temporally complex relationships between surface water and groundwater during such events in these regions are largely unknown. The catchment area (~4350 km2) upstream of Gaborone Dam on the Notwane River in south-east Botswana and northern South Africa experienced extreme rainfall and major flooding in 2016/17, following a severe 5-year drought. In this generally data-sparce area, we collected a unique data set that combined traditional water quantity observations with stable water isotope, major ion, trace metal and geophysical data. These were analysed to gain insights into water quantity and quality dynamics following flooding, including contaminant movement using trace metals as pollution indicators. Results revealed that the extreme rainfall and flooding was responsible for replenishment of surface water and groundwater resources, but also contaminant mobilisation from the surface. This subsequently resulted in increased concentrations of contaminants during the recession. Overall, hydrogeological heterogeneity dictated spatially variable surface water - groundwater interactions, characterised by poor connectivity in low productivity aquifer areas as opposed to good connectivity in moderate to high productivity aquifers. This in turn affected water quality dynamics and contamination, locally superimposed by land use impacts, primarily from urban landfill and local agricultural practices. Groundwater-connected streams had consistently lower (responses in) contaminants. We also found that Gaborone Reservoir facilitated prolonged conditions for recharge but likely also enhanced contamination of groundwater through maintaining a high water table in urban areas located immediately downstream. Management implications of our findings include a requirement for careful consideration of land use and landfill planning in relation to bedrock geology and presence of surface water reservoirs, conjunctive surface water and groundwater management, but also the need for even higher (space-time) resolution of monitoring in these data sparce environments. This could contribute to enhancing the benefits that extreme rainfall events provide in terms of surface water and groundwater resources replenishment for future dry seasons and periods of drought.

AB The side slope to a roadside swale (drainage ditch) constitutes a filter strip that has potential for infiltration of road runoff, thereby serving as a stormwater quantity and quality control mechanism. A total of thirty-two tests were performed during three seasons in four different highways located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, MN to analyze the infiltration performance of roadside filter strips and the effect of fractional coverage of water on infiltration. Three different application rates were used in the experiments. All the tests showed that water flow on the lateral slope of a roadside swale is concentrated in fingers, instead of sheet flow, at the typical road runoff intensities for which infiltration practices are utilized to improve surface water quality. A linear relationship between flux of water from the road and fraction of wetted surface was observed, for the intensities tested.
   The average percentage infiltration of the medium road runoff rate (1.55 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) experiments performed in fall was 85% and in spring 70%. For the high road runoff rate (3.1 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) tests the average amount of water infiltrated was 47% and for the low road runoff rate (7.76 x 10(-5) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) tests it was 69%, both set of tests performed in spring and summer. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of swale soil was high, relative to the values typical of laboratory permeameter measurements for these types of soils. This is believed to be due to the macropores generated by vegetation roots, activity of macrofauna (e.g. earthworms), and construction/maintenance procedures. The trend was to have more infiltration when the saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher and for a greater side slope length, as expected. The vegetation, type of soil and length of the side slope are important to consider for constructing and maintaining roadside swales that will be efficient as stormwater control measures. These measurements indicate that the filter strip portion of a roadside swale typically infiltrates a substantial fraction of road runoff. However, the measurements do not incorporate the influence of direct rainfall upon the infiltration into filter strips. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We explore the use of seismic noise produced by rivers to monitor the bed load transport in the case of a low-discharge braided river in the French Alps: the "torrent de St Pierre". For this purpose, we deployed two dedicated seismic networks during summers 2007 and 2008, for which the characteristics of the recorded continuous signal are similar despite changes in the sensor locations. For dry weather conditions, only melting of nearby glaciers controls the supply of water to the stream. In these conditions, the river hydrology and the seismic energy in the 2-80 Hz frequency band both follow a diurnal fluctuation similar to the thermal amplitude. In contrast during rainfall episodes, the temperature variation fails to explain the hydrodynamic changes. Dense cloud covers reduce glacier melting and the recorded seismic energy denotes bursts of high-frequency seismic noise well correlated with water level data. Comparisons between the recorded seismic signals and the collected hydrological and sediment load data indicate that a frequency band of 3-9 Hz best explains the water level changes and thus the seismic waves coming from the flow turbulence. These analyses also reveal the presence of a seismic noise threshold that might be linked to the water shear stress exerted by the flowing water. Using the seismic energy in this frequency band as a proxy of the fluvial shear stress, the seismic-hydrologic relationship may be sensitive to variations in bed load transport. The spectral content of the seismic energy shows patterns consistent with the mobilization of sediment particles. From the interpretations of the seismic wave attenuation of river sources, we finally propose that stations at a distance from the stream less than 50 m are able to record most sediment particles. Farther stations are still useful during extreme events when largest grain sizes are mobilized. More generally this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the river seismic signal to survey bed load transport in various river types from small braided mountain rivers like the "torrent de St Pierre" to the large entrenched Himalayan rivers.

AB A popular method for the determination of catchment zones is the construction by particle tracking. A new approach is presented, allowing to quantify the uncertainty of particle paths and catchment zones by the direct propagation of uncertainties of aquifer parameters into the uncertainty of the location of contaminating particles. This is achieved by applying the conditional First-Order Second Moment (FOSM) method to both the discretised groundwater flow and the particle tracking equations. Beside of the mean particle tracks, the standard deviations (sigma(x), sigma(y)) of the location (x, y) of a particle within the 2-dimensional flow field are directly calculated. This allows calculating probabilities for which particles can be found within their I uncertainty cloud'. By starting particles at all gridpoints of the groundwater model this method is applied to the delineation of stochastic well head protection zones. The performance of the proposed new method is shown for the determination of capture zones for an aquifer in Gambach (State of Hessia, Germany).
   It is demonstrated that the method yields comparable results to a corresponding conditional Monte Carlo approach. Detailed statistical analysis of the conditional Monte Carlo simulations showed the following additional central results:
   (1) Conditioning with piezometric head information in the Monte Carlo approach yielded a high correlation between the transmissivity values and the recharge values. Subsequent regression analysis for the Monte Carlo results revealed that the given head measurements together with the random recharge values determined the transmissivity values used to describe the aquifer. The derived explicit linear relationships allow to calculate the transmissivity values directly from the random recharge values without inverse modelling for this study.
   (2) A covariance analysis of estimated parameters was performed. Derived confidence ellipses showed narrow confidence bounds for estimated recharge and transmissivity values.
   (3) While frequency distributions for velocities in the conditional Monte Carlo approach follow a log-normal distribution, this is not the case for piezometric heads. Here, Weibull-, Rayleigh-, FRatio and Gamma-Distribution perform more satisfactorily, in particular in the reproduction of the observed skewness of the output distributions.
   As the proposed FOSM-method is based on a Taylor Series approximation, its application is restricted to moderate cases of model input parameters uncertainty. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flood disaster resilience management and decision-making are comprehensive prevention and control strategies that integrate pre-disaster prevention, in-disaster scheduling and post-disaster reconstruction. In view of the many deficiencies in current flood disaster resilience research in terms of uncertainty measurement, dynamic regulation and management decision-making, a new method for the analysis of the driving mechanism of flood disaster resilience and management decision-making based on the fuzzy mathematical theory improved Bayesian belief network (BBN) is proposed. A case study was conducted in 15 state-owned farms under the jurisdiction of the Jiansanjiang Branch in Heilongjiang Province, China. The model predicts the resilience level with missing indicators. A diagnostic analysis of the correlation between indicators and resilience improvement and a sensitivity analysis of the dynamic evaluation of the importance of indicators are performed, and fuzzy decisions are made to quantify different decision-making schemes. The results show that when a single indicator is missing, the prediction accuracy exceeds 80%. However, the lack of economic indicators has a substantial impact on the results, and the accuracy is reduced to 63.3%, indicating that economic indicators are the key dimension affecting the evaluation of flood disaster resilience levels in the study area, which also provides a focus for previous data collection efforts. The diagnostic analysis constructs an index sequence to guide the improvement in resilience, in which the water surface rate and rainfall are the most direct driving forces affecting resilience. On this basis, the differences in the driving forces of each farm are further analyzed in detail. Sensitivity analysis shows that rainfall, per capita GDP, and the energy consumption of agricultural machinery are the indicators that occur most frequently among the top three sensitivity indicators of all farms. The 859 farm, Chuangye farm and Nongjiang farm are typical farms with a high sensitivity to rainfall and economic indicators. Fuzzy decision -making takes the comprehensive grade score of implementation motivation as a quantitative evaluation crite-rion, which provides guidance for decision-making based on the two dimensions of time and space.

AB The changes of terrestrial water storage (TWS) is critical for drought monitoring, water and food security, global water cycle and climate change studies. Currently, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites are unique means of observing large-scale water storage variations, but the short time series (2002-present) limits their applications in long term climatic and hydrologic studies. Although the TWS can be calculated from global land surface models, large uncertainties arise due to uncertainties of inputs and the limitations of the models. This study developed a reconstruction model for GRACE TWS anomalies (TWSA) based on the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model outputs by using a Random Forest (RF) regression approach. A Spatially Moving Window (SMW) structure was introduced when training the RF model to address the spatial variations of TWSA, and a linear regression approach (LR) was also used for comparison purpose. Long-term TWSA over China land area were generated based on the proposed approaches and results were validated through cross-validation and comparisons with reference datasets. As a result, the RF-based model outperforms the LR-based model, and the reconstructed TWSA by using the two models both well reproduce GRACE dataset and outperform the TWSA that are derived directly from GLDAS models. Moreover, the TWSA produced by using the presented models have good agreements with another global GRACE-based reconstructed TWSA dataset and in-situ soil moisture measurements. Importance value for each variable in the RF model was quantified as well as the spatial coefficients for each variable in the LR model. The importance values and regression coefficients present varying spatial patterns. Rather than modifying the land surface model structure and inputs, this study provides alternative ways of improving the TWS estimations of GLDAS and extending time range of GRACE datasets. The experiments are expected to promote and enrich the methodologies and theories of combining physical and statistical models for optimal simulations in geoscientific research.

AB Recent studies have reported that connected impervious areas - those impervious surfaces that contribute directly to runoff in a storm network or stream - are a better indicator of hydrologic response, stream alteration, and water quality than total impervious area. However, most methods for quantifying connected impervious areas require major assumptions regarding the definition of 'connection', potentially over-simplifying the role of variable climates, slope gradients, soils conditions, and heterogeneous flow paths on impervious surface connectivity. This study presents a new conceptual model and method for estimating hydrologically connected impervious areas (HCIA) that explicitly considers the effect of landscape and storm variability. The model separates impervious surfaces into two categories: directly or physically connected (A(phys)) and variably connected (A(var)) (impervious that drains to pervious). Of these categories, we investigated the sensitivity of A(var) connectivity to varying soil conditions, slope gradients, rainfall properties, and hillslope geometry using PySWMM (a python interface for SWMM5). Simulations spanned a large parameter space with varying soil, slope, rainfall properties and geometries (i.e., relationships between the impervious and downslope pervious areas). PySWMM simulations were used to train and test a regression tree that predicts infiltration and connectivity of runoff from A var surfaces, which provides excellent fidelity with PySWMM outcomes. To enable use of these methods in practice, we developed an ArcGIS tool that (1) delineates subcatchments; (2) extracts the impervious surface categories A(phys) and A(var ); (3) applies the regression tree algorithm to predict the fraction of incident rainfall that produces runoff across A(var); and (4) summarizes the resulting HCIA by subcatchment. Analysis of the regression feature importance shows that, in general, A(var) connectivity is highly sensitive to the soil type, rainfall depth, area fraction, and antecedent soil moisture conditions of the downslope pervious area. We find that temporally varying parameters (e.g., rainfall and antecedent soil moisture) control A(var) connectivity in areas with low permeability soils, while spatial flow path variability (e.g., relative quantity of disconnecting pervious area) controls A var connectivity in areas with highly permeable soils. The methods developed in this study can be used to identify impervious surface connectivity more accurately in urban watersheds, representing an important step forward for incorporating spatial heterogeneity in stormwater modeling and planning.

AB The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is the largest water resource protection zone in China, and environmental safety is crucial to its operation. For both aqueous and sediment phases, diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT), total vanadium (V) concentration (C-Total-V), and community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction data were used to measure the pollution characteristics, horizontal and vertical distributions of DGT-labile V, and the dynamic mobilization of V in a typical tributary (the Meixi River) of the TGR. The results showed that C-Total-V in the surface sediments were obviously higher than the background values in sediment and soil, indicating a potential anthropogenic input of V in this area. A positive relationship was found between total organic carbon (TOC) and C-Total-V in the sediments, indicating that the pollution characteristics of V were associated with TOC. In addition, horizontal and vertical distributions of the fluxes of DGT-labile V (F-DGT-V) varied among the four DGT probes. In the same DGT probe, the horizontal distributions (0-6 mm, 6-12 mm and 12-18 mm) of F-DGT-V were similar in the overlying water; however, the values showed a poor coincidence with those recorded in the sediment. The vertical distribution of F-DGT-V in the same DGT probe showed similar tendencies. In fact, C-DGT-V is significantly negatively correlated with C-DGT-Fe, demonstrating that V had an inversely diffusive tendency with Fe. Moreover, diffusion fluxes of V at the sediment-water interface illustrated that the release characteristics of V varied among the sampling sites. In addition, the BCR fraction of V in the surface sediments of the four sampling sites showed that V mainly existed in the residual fraction (88.04-88.57%). The concentrations of DGT-labile V (C-DGT-V) were considerably lower than the non-residual fractions (the sum of exchangeable, reducible, and oxidizable fractions) measured by BCR sequential extraction. Correlation analysis showed that C-DGT-V had no correlation with non-residual V fractions, indicating that it is doubtful whether BCR extraction alone can be used to predict the bioavailability of V in this study.

AB The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential relationship between flash flood events and convective precipitation in Catalonia, as well as any related trends. The paper starts with an overview of flash floods and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of, and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996-2011) but more extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation. Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective contribution to rainfall, introducing the beta parameter as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as a Multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events. The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values, of precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain this positive trend in flash flood events. The beta parameter has been also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short and local events, usually with daily beta values above 0.5, while the minimum threshold of daily beta for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.

AB The formation and development of fog and low stratus clouds (FLS) depend on meteorological and land surface conditions and their interactions with each other. While analyses of temporal and spatial patterns of FLS in Europe exist, the interactions between FLS determinants underlying them have not been studied explicitly and quantitatively at a continental scale yet. In this study, a state-of-the-art machine learning technique is applied to model FLS occurrence over continental Europe, using meteorological and land surface parameters from geostationary satellite and re-analysis data. Spatially explicit model units are created to test for spatial and seasonal differences in model performance and FLS sensitivities to changes in predictors, and effects of different data preprocessing procedures are evaluated. The statistical models show good performance in predicting FLS occurrence during validation, with R-2>0.9 especially in winter high pressure situations.The predictive skill of the models seems to be dependent on data availability, data preprocessing, time period, and geographic characteristics. It is shown that atmospheric proxies are more important determinants of FLS presence than surface characteristics, in particular mean sea level pressure, near-surface wind speed and evapotranspiration are crucial, together with FLS occurrence on the previous day. Higher wind speeds, higher land surface temperatures and higher evapotranspiration tend to be negatively related to FLS. Spatial patterns of feature importance show the dominant influence of mean sea level pressure on FLS occurrence throughout the central European domain. When only high pressure situations are considered, wind speed (in the western study region) and evapotranspiration (in the eastern study region) gain importance, highlighting the influence of moisture advection on FLS occurrence in the western parts of the central European domain. This study shows that FLS occurrence can be accurately modeled using machine learning techniques in large spatial domains based on meteorological and land surface predictors. The statistical models used in this study provide a novel analysis tool for investigating empirical relationships in the FLS - land surface system and possibly infer processes.

AB Breakthrough pressure plays an important role in shale gas flow, mining, and caprock evaluation. A series of breakthrough experiments were conducted under different water saturation conditions for four shales taken from the Carboniferous Hoit Taria Formation in the eastern Qaidam Basin, China to investigate the influence of water saturation on breakthrough pressure. Relevant geochemical tests (mineral composition, clay content, total organic carbon, thermal maturity and vitrinite reflectance) and micro structural characteristics of micro pores were also conducted. Breakthrough pressures under at least five different water saturations (from 0 to 100%) were obtained and relationship between breakthrough pressure and water saturation was fitted for each sample.
   We found that breakthrough pressure increases exponentially with water saturation. The decrease in effective pore diameter caused by both the bound water films and the swelling of the clay minerals resulted in the increase in the breakthrough pressure. After water saturation reached about 60%, breakthrough pressure increased rapidly from connectivity reduction, caused by the sealing off of smaller pores and partial water saturation of the macropores, By analyzing the correlation between breakthrough pressure and pore structure characteristics, breakthrough pressure is inversely related to porosity, and is primarily affected by macropores. Because macropores consist of many microfractures with lengths up to dozens of micrometers, they determine the porosity and then affect the connectivity of the rock. Correlation analysis between the mineral compositions and breakthrough pressure showed that TOC content exhibits a positive correlation with breakthrough pressure, but neither quartz content nor the clay mineral content exhibits a correlation. By combining this information with Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope results, we found that microfractures are easily created where the TOC (total organic carbon) is concentrated, and these microfractures substantially contribute to the number of macropores. However, dissolution pores in the quartz and clay minerals are rare. Therefore, the correlation between TOC content and breakthrough pressure primarily results from the microfractures. This study provides practical information for further studies of shale gas migration as well as shale gas mining and caprock evaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) represents the optically active component of the DOM pool, and originates from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources. The fluorescent characteristics of dissolved organic matter (FDOM) has been widely used to trace CDOM sources and infer its composition. However, little is known about the optical and fluorescent properties of CDOM in drinking water reservoirs, and the variability of CDOM properties along trophic gradients in these aquatic systems. A total of 536 water samples were collected between 2015 and 2017 from 131 reservoirs across China to characterize CDOM and FDOM properties using both light absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, and examine relationships with water-quality condition as expressed by the modified trophic state index (TSIM) of the reservoirs (range: 12 < TSIM < 78). With increased reservoir trophic status, CDOM absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a(CDOM)(254)) and total fluorescence of FRI-EEMs (excitation-emission matrix coupled with fluorescence regional integration) increased significantly (p < 0.01). Our results indicated that the nutrients in aquatic systems and the social economy factors (including wastewater, sewage, cultivated land, GDP, population) and altitude affect the CDOM absorption and fluorescence significantly (p < 0.05). Most importantly, we proposed a new classification standard associated with eutrophic status via CDOM humification index (HIX) due to the significant correlation between each other (p < 0.01). HIX less than 4 was corresponding to TSIM less than 30 as oligotrophic states; 4 < HIX <= 12 was corresponding to TSIM less than 50 as mesotrophic states; 12 < HIX <= 18 was corresponding to TSIM less than 70 as eutrophic states; HIX more than 18 is defined as hypereutrophic status with TSIM > 70. This method highlights the importance of CDOM fluorescence for aquatic DOM input and strengthens the linkage between the trophic status index and CDOM characteristics, it also contributes to establish a new rapid assessing model with quick experimental measurements to monitor the trophic status of water reservoirs.

AB Models that accurately predict forest interception are essential both for water balance studies and for assessing watershed responses to changes in land use and the long-term climate variability. This paper compares the performance of four rainfall interception models-the sparse Gash (1995), Rutter et al. (1975), Liu (1997) and two new models (NvMxa and NvMxb)-using data from four spatially extensive, structurally diverse forest ecosystems in Mexico. Ninety-eight case studies measuring interception in tropical dry (25), arid/semi-arid (29), temperate (26), and tropical montane cloud forests (18) were compiled and analyzed. Coefficients derived from raw data or published statistical relationships were used as model input to evaluate multi-storm forest interception at the case study scale. On average empirical data showed that, tropical montane cloud, temperate, arid/semi-arid and tropical dry forests intercepted 14%, 18%, 22% and 26% of total precipitation, respectively. The models performed well in predicting interception, with mean deviations between measured and modeled interception as a function of total precipitation (ME) generally <5.8% and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency E estimators >0.66. Model fitting precision was dependent on the forest ecosystem. Arid/semi-arid forests exhibited the smallest, while tropical montane cloud forest displayed the largest ME deviations. Improved agreement between measured and modeled data requires modification of in-storm evaporation rate in the Liu; the canopy storage in the sparse Gash model; and the throughfall coefficient in the Rutter and the NvMx models. This research concludes on recommending the wide application of rainfall interception models with some caution as they provide mixed results. The extensive forest interception data source, the fitting and testing of four models, the introduction of a new model, and the availability of coefficient values for all four forest ecosystems are an important source of information and a benchmark for future investigations in this area of hydrology.

AB Cretaceous trans-boundary aquifers in the central and northern parts of Sinai (Egypt) and the Negev (Israel), are geographically and geologically both contiguous and continuous. Hydrogeological and hydrochemical studies of these aquifers, with disregard to political boundaries, are scarce. The Lower Cretaceous Kurnub Group aquifer in Sinai and the Negev hosts paleowater mostly replenished during the Pleistocene. The objectives of this study are to elucidate the relationship between regional structural elements and the salinization of groundwater in the Kurnub Group in Sinai and further downstream in the Negev.
   The stable plateaus in southern Sinai and the fold structures in the north continuing into the Negev are separated by the W-E striking Minshara-Ramon shear zone. With the exception of higher salinities in the north, the chemical composition of Kurnub Group groundwater north and south of the shear zone is similar. Similarly, groundwater in the overlying Upper Cretaceous aquifer differs from Kurnub groundwater only within and north of the shear zone and is characterized by higher Ct concentrations, lower Mg/rCa ratios (due to high Ca in the calcareous aquifer) and by a "heavier" isotopic signature. Inverse hydrogeochemical modeling using PHREEQC indicates that the increase in salinity of Kurnub groundwater within the shear zone and in adjacent areas could be due to two different sources: First, the salinization process could be the result of mixing with sulfate-rich brackish groundwater occurring in Jurassic formations, which are in fault-controlled lateral contact with the Kurnub Group aquifer. Second, the salinity differences could be from unflushed seawater in the subsurface of the northern Sinai and western Negev, i.e. possible remnants of the post-Messinian (Lower Pliocene) transgression, which penetrated into northern Sinai, the western Negev and the Coastal Plain of Israel both through erosional channels, which were incised during the Neogene, and by flooding over outcrops of permeable formations.

AB An aquifer test involving seven days of pumping and five days of recovery was performed in the unconfined aquifer at Canadian Forces Base Borden in Ontario, Canada. Hydraulic head levels were intensively monitored in eleven observation wells, and moisture content profiles were frequently logged using a neutron moisture probe at six different radial distances from the pumping well. Capillary fringe thickness variations were inferred by comparing these hydraulic and moisture content measurements.
   Allowing for the effects of lithologic variations, the response of the moisture content profile is predominately characterized by a downward translation during pumping-induced drainage. Our observations indicate that there is minimal excess storage above the capillary fringe at late times. The capillary fringe extended significantly with pumping in comparison to its static thickness; this extension progressively increased during the entire test. The capillary fringe extension decreased with increasing radial distance and was inferred to have eventually extended out to between 20 and 25 m. This extension represented a significant volume of excess capillary fringe storage that persisted into late times. A direct relationship between the vertical gradients below the water table and the excess capillary fringe storage is not apparent from these experimental data.
   Analogous to the pumping test observations, the response of the moisture content profile during recovery is essentially an upward translation. While the hydraulic head levels recovered nearly to their pre-pumping elevations, the moisture content profiles stabilized approximately 0.20 m below their pre-pumping positions. This recovery differential leads to a capillary fringe compression that converted excess storage during pumping into storage deficit during recovery. In contrast to the significant radial variation of the capillary fringe extension during pumping, the capillary fringe compression is relatively uniform out to at least 15 m during the late recovery stage. The recovery deficit and entrapped residual air observed below the upward translating transition zone are strong indications that significant hysteretic processes are occurring at the field scale.

AB The group of springs located in the west part of the Val d'Orleans exemplifies a type of karstic emergence which has the particularity to get most of its recharge water from a single surface water source, which in this particular case is the River Loire. Hence the flow of this group of springs is known to fluctuate in a close relationship with the water level of the River Loire. Since the second half of the 1990s, the conduit of the upstream spring of the Loiret river (so-called Le Bouillon) has been periodically seen to be invaded by the turbid waters of a small surface tributary (Le Dhuy) flowing back from the confluence to the spring, which then functioned as a swallow-hole. Plotted in a Dhuy versus River Loire diagram, stages of backflooding days describe a domain limited by a curve of the form HDhuy = c + e((aH Loire+b)). The exponential form of the relation corresponds to the increasing resistance of the emerging flow of the spring to the backflooding of the tributary waters, as the River Loire stages rise. The equation above was used to compute a daily backflow index enabling the effective reconstruction of all occurrences effectively counted during the regular period of observation of the spring. Extended to 1985, one can observe that the early 1990s do not appear as a favorable period to backflow events but some may have occurred during the years 1986 to 1989. The observation of rainfall intensity preceding backflooding shows that in a short time span there is no necessity to evoke intrinsic changes inside the Val d'Orleans basin to explain what might appear as a troublesome new phenomenon. In conclusion backflooding has probably existed for a long time and is simply under the control of local heavy rainfall during low River Loire stages. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding how changes in individual land use types influence the dynamics of streamflow and sediment yield would greatly improve the predictability of the hydrological consequences of land use changes and could thus help stakeholders to make better decisions. Multivariate statistics are commonly used to compare individual land use types to control the dynamics of streamflow or sediment yields. However, one issue with the use of conventional statistical methods to address relationships between land use types and streamflow or sediment yield is multicollinearity. In this study, an integrated approach involving hydrological modelling and partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to quantify the contributions of changes in individual land use types to changes in streamflow and sediment yield. In a case study, hydrological modelling was conducted using land use maps from four time periods (1978, 1987, 1999, and 2007) for the Upper Du watershed (8973 km(2)) in China using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Changes in streamflow and sediment yield across the two simulations conducted using the land use maps from 2007 to 1978 were found to be related to land use changes according to a PLSR, which was used to quantify the effect of this influence at the sub-basin scale. The major land use changes that affected streamflow in the studied catchment areas were related to changes in the farmland, forest and urban areas between 1978 and 2007; the corresponding regression coefficients were 0.232, -0.147 and 1.256, respectively, and the Variable Influence on Projection (VIP) was greater than 1. The dominant first-order factors affecting the changes in sediment yield in our study were: farmland (the VIP and regression coefficient were 1.762 and 14.343, respectively) and forest (the VIP and regression coefficient were 1.517 and -7.746, respectively). The PLSR methodology presented in this paper is beneficial and novel, as it partially eliminates the co-dependency of the variables and facilitates a more unbiased view of the contribution of the changes in individual land use types to changes in streamflow and sediment yield. This practicable and simple approach could be applied to a variety of other watersheds for which time-sequenced digital land use maps are available. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Stochastic analysis of the relationship between topography and the
   spatial distribution of soil moisture
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOW; HILLSLOPE; LAYER
AB This paper deals with the issue of the spatial horizontal variability of soil moisture in the root zone of a shallow soil at the large scale. The problem of water flow in the unsaturated zone is formulated so that topography appears explicitly as a forcing for the movement and redistribution of soil moisture. This formulation emphasizes the role of the lateral redistribution of water that is induced by topography. A stochastic theory is developed to relate the statistical distribution of soil moisture to that of elevation. This approach will ultimately facilitate the use of the readily available data sets describing topography for the purpose of defining the large-scale distribution of soil moisture. The steady state horizontal distribution of soil moisture under homogeneous bare soil conditions is regulated by three distinct factors: topography, climate, and soil properties. First, topography, forces a distribution of soil moisture that tends to mimic the elevation field at large scales. The other two factors are the vertical divergence of water in response to the climate forcing (evaporation) and the capillary resistance to water movement. The climate forcing tends to smooth the spatial distribution of soil moisture. However, the capillary forces exerted by the soil matrix tend to resist displacement of water and hence exert adverse effects against the topography and climate forcings. The variance of the soil moisture distribution increases with the variance of the elevation held and decreases with the correlation scale of the elevation field and the magnitude of the climate forcing. The impact of capillary forces on the vertical fluxes of water is more significant than their impact on the topographically induced horizontal fluxes, owing to the larger hydraulic gradient in the vertical, direction resulting from the disparity in scale between the vertical and horizontal directions.

AB Floodplains are critical landscape features that are highly distinguished from neighboring uplands in terms of their hydrologic, geomorphologic, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. Thus an essential step in floodplain studies is the determination of the lateral floodplain extent and its variability within a basin. Recent advances in topographic mapping and GIS-based analysis provide a means for developing automated techniques to determine floodplain extent. In this study, we propose a hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation which links a simplified inundation algorithm with the river basin properties. We utilize the method to investigate the physical controls on floodplain formation, as captured by scaling relations between floodplain width and contributing area. Our hypothesis is that an efficient delineation grounded in hydrogeomorphic theory can improve our understanding of floodplain geometry across a range of conditions. We test the method for two distinct watersheds, a humid catchment in Italy and an ephemeral basin in New Mexico, and note the existence of power law scaling of the floodplain width after averaging over stream orders. An analysis of the algorithm parameters is conducted to identify possible limitations. Further systematic tests are needed to establish the generality of the floodplain scaling and its control on floodplain processes.

AB After a landfill leaks, pollutants gradually accumulate in the strata surrounding the landfill to form a pollution source area, which provides a continuous stream of pollutants to the spreading pollution plume. The identification of the source area is of great significance to assess the scope of the pollution plume and to take corresponding remedial measures. The focus of this study was to construct a numerical model by integrating electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data, hydrochemical data, and stratigraphic data, which can be used to assess the extent of the contamination from a leaky landfill and to suggest remediation designs. The concentration distribution of the leachate in the source area was obtained based on the underground resistivity distribution and the petrophysical relationship, which was used as the initial concentration in the numerical model. Borehole data and stratigraphic data provided stratigraphic information for the model construction. Hydrochemical data were used to calibrate the numerical model. The numerical model constructed by integrating multi-source data represented the spatial heterogeneity of the stratigraphic information and the geochemical information obtained based on borehole data, and the quantitative evaluation results such as the spatial distribution of pollutants were more accurate. The results showed that the leaking pollutants were collected in the fractured zones around the landfill. The important priority channel for pollutant migration was the densely distributed fault zone in the north and south of the landfill. Affected by hydraulic gradients and fractures, the spread area on the north side of the landfill was much larger than that on the south side. Pollutants moved from southwest to northeast, consistent with groundwater flow. After 20 years of leakage, the maximum diffusion range of the pollutants was estimated to be 1620.36 m. The vertical barrier walls designed based on ERT data and numerical simulation results were expected to block further migration of the pollutants. Combining multi-source data to build a numerical model can provide a valuable basis for environmental impacts and remediation recommendations.

AB Large-scale afforestation can combat desertification, provide ecosystem services, and mitigate climate change. However, it can also have negative effects on the hydrological cycle and water budget, and thus on water security in dryland regions depending on the afforestation strategy used. Currently, the effects of different afforestation strategies on soil moisture dynamics, evapotranspiration (ET), and water budget at the stand scale are unclear. In this study, we investigated the water budget in two poplar stands, one planted using a low-coverage-mode shelterbelt (LCMS) strategy and the other planted using a conventional strategy (control). Deep drainage (DP), as an indicator of water budget, was estimated using a Hydrus-1D model calibrated with the observed soil moisture at different soil depths (across 0-200 cm) during the growing seasons in 2016, 2017, and 2019. The average DP in the LCMS stand was 107.0-149.6 mm, accounting for 36.5-42.4% of the rainfall occurring during the growing seasons, which was slightly higher than that in the control stand containing younger trees at a higher density. However, DP was more spatially heterogenous in the LCMS stand compared with in the control stand. Specifically, in the LCMS stand, the inter-canopy DP was 195.3-237.5 mm, accounting for 66.6-69.7% of the rainfall, whereas the under-canopy DP was only 18.7-65.0 mm, accounting for 6.4-18.4% of the rainfall during the corresponding period. Structural equation modeling indicated that, on a daily scale, soil moisture had the greatest effect on DP, followed by precipitation and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity. Other climate factors (global radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed) and vegetation structure parameters (leaf area index and rooting depth) affected ET, which had a significantly negative relationship with DP. These results help explain the effects of plantation strategy on the water budget, with important implications for artificial forest management, ecological restoration, and protection of local water resources in water-limited environments.

AB The performance of water quality models depends on both data from the external inputs and the internal processes of a water body. Limited field data can often be the major cause of errors in water quality prediction when modeling, especially in large environments. The aim of this study was to improve the prediction accuracy of water quality in a large lake using the combined application of an artificial neural network (ANN) method and a numerical model. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) method was used as an ANN method to generate temporal input data by learning complex relationships of water quality variables from two types of water quality monitoring systems at major boundaries. A regular monitoring system analyzes 13 water quality variables in 3 layers monthly or weekly, while the automatic monitoring system analyzes 8 surface water quality variables daily. The Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC), 3-D hydrodynamics and water quality model, was calibrated with 55,588 grids to simulate the water quality of the 46.5 km section of Daecheong Lake. The accuracy of the EFDC models was assessed at four locations in the lake for the application of daily data generated by MLP models against that of interpolated data from a regular monitoring system as input of EFDC boundary conditions. According to the averaged index of agreement (IA), the performance of MLP-EFDC showed more accurate results than the EFDC using interpolated data for most variables. In particular, the maximum increase in the average IA was 14.4% for total phosphorus. However, the performances of MLP-EFDC were not significantly improved in the downstream section of the study area, where the input effects were mixed with the internal processes of the lake. This study shows that (1) unmonitored temporal input data can be developed using ANN techniques if data for learning processes are available, and (2) the linkage between the ANN technique and the numerical model can improve the prediction accuracy of the water quality in a large lake.

AB Maps of ecosystem services are becoming increasingly useful for reporting on the potential impacts of human activity on the environment. However, interactions in watersheds are complex, and mapping hydrological ecosystem services (HES) requires indicators which accurately measure underlying processes. The main objective of this study was to take advantage of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to map the erosion regulation service for a managed boreal forest watershed. To do so, SWAT and partial least-squares (PLS) regression were used to select explanatory variables for sediment yield. Variables of importance in projection (VIP) with a score > 1 were selected to develop LiDAR-based ecological indicators. Four categories of variables were identified as VIP from the PLS: (i) climate: annual precipitation, (ii) land use: forest, cutovers; (iii) land use patterns: cutover patch cohesion index, and (iv) morphometric: main channel length, channel length and sub-watershed area. The height of the 95th percentile of LiDAR returns (p95) < 5 m provided the most accurate spatial representation of cutovers and the optimal cutover patch cohesion index. Other morphometrics were obtained from a LiDAR-based digital terrain model. Explanatory variables for sediment yield were combined in a sediment erosion control (SEC) index, except for yearly average precipitation because the SEC index is not actually used as a temporal index. As expected, a negative relationship was found between sediment yield and SEC index rankings for the 2006-2015 period (Spearman, rho = -0.6, p < 0.05). Moreover, the overall agreement between SWAT and SEC index classes was 87% for 31 sub-watersheds. The study provides a list of relevant explanatory variables for modelling sediment yield in a boreal forest watershed where timber harvest activities occur. It also demonstrates the use of LiDAR data for deriving an index of the erosion regulation ecosystem service in a proxy-based approach as it had not been demonstrated previously at the watershed level. The validation method applied here fills a gap in ecosystem services mapping that could benefit studies in other watershed contexts.

TI A remote sensing method for estimating regional reservoir area and

AB Evaporation from the water surface of a reservoir can significantly affect its function of ensuring the availability and temporal stability of water supply. Current estimations of reservoir evaporative loss are dependent on water area derived from a reservoir storage-area curve. Such curves are unavailable if the reservoir is located in a data-sparse region or questionable if long-term sedimentation has changed the original elevation-area relationship. We propose a remote sensing framework to estimate reservoir evaporative loss at the regional scale. This framework uses a multispectral water index to extract reservoir area from Landsat imagery and estimate monthly evaporation volume based on pan-derived evaporative rates. The optimal index threshold is determined based on local observations and extended to unobserved locations and periods. Built on the cloud computing capacity of the Google Earth Engine, this framework can efficiently analyze satellite images at large spatiotemporal scales, where such analysis is infeasible with a single computer. Our study involves 200 major reservoirs in Texas, captured in 17,811 Landsat images over a 32-year period. The results show that these reservoirs contribute to an annual evaporative loss of 8.0 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 20% of their total active storage or 53% of total annual water use in Texas. At five coastal basins, reservoir evaporative losses exceed the minimum freshwater inflows required to sustain ecosystem health and fishery productivity of the receiving estuaries. Reservoir evaporative loss can be significant enough to counterbalance the positive effects of impounding water and to offset the contribution of water conservation and reuse practices. Our results also reveal the spatially variable performance of the multispectral water index and indicate the limitation of using scene-level cloud cover to screen satellite images. This study demonstrates the advantage of combining satellite remote sensing and cloud computing to support regional water resources assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ever growing importance of sustainable management of reservoir sedimentation has promoted the development and applications of turbidity current models. However, there are few effective and practical models in literature for turbidity currents in a reservoir where the impounded area involves both the main river and its many tributaries. An integrated numerical model coupling open-channel flow, turbidity current and flow exchanges between main river and tributaries is proposed, which can simulate the complex flow and sediment transport in a reservoir where these three physical processes coexist. The model consists of two sets of governing equations for the open-channel flow and turbidity current, which are based on the modified St. Venant equations by taking into account the effect of lateral flow exchanges. These two sets of equations are solved in the finite volume method framework and the solutions are executed in an alternating calculation mode. Different methods are respectively proposed to calculate the discharge of flow exchange caused by free surface gradient and turbidity current intrusion. For the surface-gradient driven flow exchange, a storage cell method, which re-defines the relationship between water level and representative cross-sectional area, is used to update the water level at confluence. For the turbidity current intrusion, a discharge formula is proposed based on the analysis of the energy and momentum transformation in the intruding turbid water body. This formula differs from previous ones in that the effect of tributary bed slope is considered. Two events of water-sediment regulation conducted in the Xiaolangdi Reservoir in 2004 and 2006 were simulated to test the ability of this model. The predicted reservoir drawdown process, the turbidity current evolution and the sediment venting efficiency were in close agreement with the measurements. The necessity to couple the flow exchanges was demonstrated by comparing the performance of the proposed model with different intrusion discharge formulas and the common one-dimensional model neglecting the main river and tributary interaction.

AB The objective of this paper is to exploit potential application of an evidential belief function (EBF) model for spatial prediction of groundwater productivity at Langat basin area, Malaysia using geographic information system (GIS) technique. About 125 groundwater yield data were collected from well locations. Subsequently, the groundwater yield was divided into high ( >= 11 m(3)/h) and low yields (<11 m(3)/h) respectively, based on the groundwater classification standard recommended by Department of Mineral and Geosciences (JMG), Malaysia. Out of all of the borehole data, only 60 wells possessed higher yield at >= 11 m(3)/h. Further, these wells were randomly divided into a testing dataset 70% (42 wells) for training the model and the remaining 30% (18 wells) was used for validation purpose. To perform cross validation, the frequency ratio (FR) approach was applied into remaining groundwater wells with low yield to show the spatial correlation between the low potential zones of groundwater productivity. A total of twelve groundwater conditioning factors that affect the storage of groundwater occurrences were derived from various data sources such as satellite based imagery, topographic maps and associated database. Those twelve groundwater conditioning factors are elevation, slope, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), drainage density, lithology, lineament density, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil and rainfall. Subsequently, the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence model was applied to prepare the groundwater potential map. Finally, the result of groundwater potential map derived from belief map was validated using testing data. Furthermore, to compare the performance of the EBF result, logistic regression model was applied. The success-rate and prediction-rate curves were computed to estimate the efficiency of the employed EBF model compared to LR method. The validation results demonstrated that the success-rate for EBF and LR methods were 83% and 82% respectively. The area under the curve for prediction-rate of EBF and LR methods were calculated 78% and 72% respectively. The outputs achieved from the current research proved the efficiency of EBF in groundwater potential mapping. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of roads in steep slope mountain areas is often linked with the occurrence of landslides and erosive dynamics. The use of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS)-derived high-resolution topographic data increased the possibilities to better represent landscapes and related physical processes at the watershed scale. Additionally, the adoption of topographically-based hydrological models allows to simulating water overland flows and investigate the occurrence of specific degradative phenomena. Snowpack melting plays a primary role in altering superficial water dynamics in mountain landscapes, but accurate investigation of the interaction between snowmelt runoff and human infrastructures (such as roads and trails) in the occurrence of hillslope failures is still obscure. This research aims to assess the relationship between snowmelt runoff, road presence and terrain in-stabilities affecting a landslide-prone steep slope mountain meadow (northern Italy). An innovative multi -modeling approach was proposed to detect the alteration of snowmelt overflows due to the presence of the road and its relation with the activation of a shallow landslide. The road role in altering snowmelt runoff was investigated both considering its presence and assuming its absence. Different hydrological and slope stability models were interactively considered, starting from pre-event ALS-derived DEM to compute predictive basin -scale simulations. Results attested the key role played by the road in altering snowmelt runoff pathways, as well as their combined contribution to the foreseen activation of the observed shallow landslide. Starting from on-field observations conducted after the landslide triggering, the accuracy of instabilities predictions was finally tested through the statistical computation of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and the Cohen's kappa-index, respectively resulted around 0.9 and 0.6. This work could be a useful tool for planning mitigation interventions able to reduce the occurrence of similar risk scenarios, also providing suggestions for developing and promoting efficient sustainable actions for mountain landscapes.

AB Flocculation of suspended particles in tidal estuaries exhibits large spatiotemporal variability due to an interplay of various physical and biogeochemical drivers. Salinity (S) is known to promote flocculation of fine-grained suspended particulate matter (SPM). However, the influence of salinity and salinity-induced stratification on flocculation has not been sufficiently investigated yet. This study aims to understand how these two factors, interactively with turbulent shear (G) and SPM concentration (C), control the vertical variation of floc size and flocculation process in different depth layers in a typical tide-dominated estuarine environment. Analysis of field observation data shows that flocculi (diameter < 20 mu m) are mainly affected by C and originate primarily from local resuspension. Macroflocs (> 200 mu m) are mainly controlled by stratification that greatly improves aggregate collision efficiency; Microflocs (20-200 mu m), as a transition group between flocculi and macroflocs, are affected by dynamics of both sides. They are influenced jointly by C, G and stratification. Besides, the fresh water-dominated surface layer is dominated by small particles (flocculi and microflocs), confined in a relatively narrow particle size range between. (100) and. (101) as a result of the low level of both C (13-20 mg/L) and S (< 2 practical salinity units). Below the surface layer, floc size increases drastically along with an increased salinityinduced density gradient and achieves maximum particle size (O (10(2))) within the stratified layer. Because of its high efficiency in promoting flocculation and formation of macroflocs, the stratified layer around the halocline can be regarded as an optimal flocculation zone. The benthic layer is characterized by high C (> 30 mg/L), gentle G (similar to 5/s), and periodic stratification, which result in a wide size range between O (10(1)) and O (10(2)) with microflocs as the dominant group. Finally, we found that the accuracy of flocculation modeling can be significantly improved by integrating a simple relationship between particle collision and stratification.

AB Geostatistical and geospatial analysis techniques were employed to evaluate relationships between high arsenic (As), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) concentrations in groundwaters from the Pleistocene Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer (MRAA) in south-central Louisiana. The MRAA is recharged by the Mississippi River, and its groundwater contains Fe concentrations that range from 0.43 to 179 mu mol kg(-1) (n = 40) and As concentrations that range from 26 nmol kg(-1) up to 8500 nmol kg(-1) (i.e., 637 mu g kg(-1)). Arsenic speciation analysis reveals a mix of redox states with As(V) accounting for between ca. 18% and ca. 84% of the total dissolved As (mean +/- 1 sigma = 61.6 +/- 24.4%, n = 6). Spatial distributions of As, Fe, and Mn concentrations suggest that the reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides is the likely source of As to the MRAA groundwaters. Geostatistical and geospatial analyses were employed to produce interpolation maps that show concentrations of As, Fe, and Mn decrease with distance from the Mississippi River. Spatial correlations are stronger between groundwater As and Fe concentrations (r = 0.710, P-As*Fe < 0.0005) than those between the As and Mn concentrations (r = 0.404, P-As*Mn < 0.0005). More specifically, regions of the MRAA characterized by high dissolved As concentrations spatially correlate with regions of high dissolved Fe concentrations, and to a lesser degree, high dissolved Mn concentrations. We hypothesize that recharge of the MRAA by Mississippi River water introduces labile organic carbon into the MRAA that subsequently fuels microbial respiration, which reduces Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides, and mobilizes adsorbed and/or co-precipitated As into MRAA groundwaters. Once mobilized, As is transported away from the riverbank by flowing groundwaters but is rapidly removed from solution by re-adsorption onto Fe/Mn oxides/oxyhydroxides within the regionally oxidized aquifer sediments. Our investigation indicates that oxidized Pleistocene sand aquifers in large river delta plains can also produce groundwater with dangerously high As concentrations if redox conditions shift to suboxic/ferruginous conditions.

AB Understanding how land-use change influences the water cycle is of critical importance to land and water management. Determining the timing, location and rates of groundwater recharge and their relationship to land-use is often challenging, leading to significant uncertainties in water budgets and water cycle planning. In this study, a combination of physical and hydrochemical/isotope techniques were used to estimate and map groundwater recharge rates and identify its key controlling factors in a rapidly urbanising catchment in southeast Australia. The primary objective was to provide qualitative and quantitative information regarding recharge, allowing comparison and monitoring of changes as future urbanisation takes place. The presence of significant tritium in shallow groundwater ( > 1.0 TU), along with radiocarbon activities > 85 pMC and low salinity (e.g. EC < 600 mu s/cm) allowed identification of areas where significant recharge has taken place in recent years. These were strongly associated with elevated topography on the basin margin, and the absence of volcanic clay - the dominant lithology underlying most of the region. This interpretation is supported by time-series analysis of soil moisture profiles, which indicate minimal vertical propagation of precipitation below 1.5 m depth in volcanic clay soils. Estimation of recharge rates was conducted using chloride mass balance and water table fluctuation analysis in water table aquifer monitoring bores. Rates mostly ranged between 1.5 and 50 mm/yr; however, recharge exceeding 100 mm/year was identified in a spatially restricted zone at the edge of the basin. Here, the volcanic lithology is absent and Quaternary sand directly overlies the lower Cainozoic sand aquifer. This area comprises a small percentage of land in the study area (approximately 15%) but is estimated to contribute a large proportion (nearly half) of recharge. The findings underscore the importance of characterising recharge locations and processes to support the protection of groundwater quality and quantity, for example, through careful land-use planning.

AB Streamflow recession analysis provides valuable insights into catchment functioning that can be related to runoff generation, storage retention and baseflow dynamics. As an integrated characteristic, recession analysis is particularly useful in catchment comparison studies to help explain drivers of spatial and temporal variability in hydrological behavior. Here, five years of hourly streamflow data from 14, partly nested, catchments within a 68 km(2) boreal forest landscape in Northern Sweden were used to explore spatiotemporal variation in hydrological processes through recession analysis. The aim of this study was to better understand spatial variation in runoff generation and storage-discharge dynamics across the landscape, as well as the relation to landscape properties. Due to high collinearity between variables, partial least square regression was used to quantify the associations between recession characteristics and catchment properties, as well as to identify key variables controlling recession behavior. We analyzed recession characteristics using both an aggregated approach including all recession data and individual recession events. The analyses based on individual recession events, indicated that catchment topography, quantified by indices such as mean slope or elevation above the stream network, is a primary control on the recession behavior during relatively high flows, whereas catchment area gains importance when flows are relatively low. The proportion of sediment and deep soils also controlled recession behavior. Furthermore, we found that recession characteristics are influenced by both evapotranspiration (ET) and proxies of antecedent catchment storage, but that the patterns were different depending on catchment properties. ET was less influential in catchments with deeper soils and larger catchment area. Shifts in recession rates were primarily related to variation in storage, with faster streamflow recessions occurring during periods with low storage. The results demonstrate the influence of catchment properties on recession behavior, and we found great value in analyzing individual recession events for an increased understanding of spatial and temporal recession characteristics. When recession properties were lumped together, the relationships to catchment characteristics were obscured. This indicates the value of more detailed analyses, at least under the strongly seasonal hydroclimatic conditions of this site.

AB The characteristic intermittency of rainfall includes temporary cessations (hiatuses), as well as periods of very low intensity within more intense events. To understand how these characteristics of rainfall affect overland flow production, rainfall simulations involving repeated cycles of on-off intermittency were carried out on dryland soils in arid western New South Wales, Australia. Periods of rain (10 mm/h) and no rain were applied in alternation with cycle times from 3 min to 25 min, in experiments lasting 1-1.5 h. Results showed that intermittency could delay the onset of runoff by more than 30 min, reduce the runoff ratio, reduce the peak runoff rate, and reduce the apparent event infiltration rate by 30-45%. When hiatuses in rainfall were longer than 15-20 min, runoff that had resulted from prior rain ceased completely before the recommencement of rain. Results demonstrate that if rainfall intermittency is not accounted for, estimates of infiltrability based on runoff plot data can be systematically in error. Despite the use of intermittent rain, the episodic occurrence of runoff could be predicted successfully by fitting multiple affine Horton infiltration equations, whose changing f(o) and K-t coefficients, but uniform values of f(c), reflected the redistribution of soil moisture and the change in the infiltrability f during hiatuses in rainfall. The value of f(c) varied little among the fitted equations, so constituting an affine set of relationships. This new approach provides an alternative to the use of steady-state methods that are common in rainfall simulation experiments and which typically yield only an estimate of f(c). The new field results confirm that intermittency affects infiltration and runoff depths and timing at plot scale and on intra-event time scales. Additional work on other soil types, and at other spatial and temporal scales, is needed to test the generality of these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in long-term, montane actual evapotranspiration (ET) in response to climate change could impact future water supplies and forest species composition. For scenarios of atmospheric warming, predicted changes in long-term ET tend to differ between studies using space-for-time substitution (STS) models and integrated watershed models, and the influence of spatially varying factors on these differences is unclear. To examine this, we compared warming-induced (+2 to +6 degrees C) changes in ET simulated by an STS model and an integrated watershed model across zones of elevation, substrate available water capacity, and slope in the snow-influenced upper San Joaquin River watershed, Sierra Nevada, USA. We used the Soil Water and Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the watershed modeling and a Budyko-type relationship for the STS modeling. Spatially averaged increases in ET from the STS model increasingly surpassed those from the SWAT model in the higher elevation zones of the watershed, resulting in 2.3-2.6 times greater values from the STS model at the watershed scale. In sparse, deep colluvium or glacial soils on gentle slopes, the SWAT model produced ET increases exceeding those from the STS model. However, watershed areas associated with these conditions were too localized for SWAT to produce spatially averaged ET-gains comparable to the STS model. The SWAT model results nevertheless demonstrate that such soils on high-elevation, gentle slopes will form ET "hot spots" exhibiting disproportionately large increases in ET, and concomitant reductions in runoff yield, in response to warming. Predicted ET responses to warming from STS models and integrated watershed models may, in general, substantially differ (e.g., factor of 2-3) for snow-influenced watersheds exhibiting an elevational gradient in substrate water holding capacity and slope. Long-term water supplies in these settings may therefore be more resilient to warming than STS model predictions would suggest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying the impacts of climate and human activities on water and sediment discharge has become a central topic in climate and hydrologic research. This issue, however, has so far received little attention in karst regions around the world. Seven karst catchments located in southwest China were chosen to explore water and sediment discharge responses to different driving factors during the period from the 1950s to 2011. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to detect both the trends and abrupt changes in water and sediment discharge. The double mass curve method was used to quantify the effects of climate and human activities on water and sediment discharge. Results indicated that the annual water discharge showed a decreasing trend in all catchments (-0.21 to-3.68 x 10(8) m(3) yr(-1)), and the sediment discharge exhibited a significant decreasing trend (-7 to-101 x 10(4) t yr(-1)) for six out of the seven catchments. A rapid decline (abrupt change) in sediment discharge occurred since 2000 for all except Liujiang catchment where the sediment discharge has a slight increase since 1983 as no large dams were constructed in this catchment. Specifically, the magnitude of reduction in sediment discharge (%) significantly increases with the extent of flow regulation as measured by the ratio of the area upstream the dam to the total catchment area for the seven catchments (R-2 = 0.98, P < 0.01). This study demonstrated that water discharge was mainly influenced by precipitation, while sediment discharge was mainly influenced by human activities (relative contribution 70-111%, regardless of whether the effect is negative or positive). Ecological restoration played somehow important roles in the decrease in sediment discharge (negative relationships of sediment discharge with the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)), but dam construction was likely to be the principal cause of the significant decrease in sediment discharge. This study is of use for better catchment management in karst regions in southwest of China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River. Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013 and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas.
   Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling (Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering three different scenarios associated with the initial construction (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population.
   Specific stage-damage functions were expressly developed using in situ data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit value were established. The relationship between water depth and the height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function. Other nonspecific magnitude-damage functions were used in order to compare both economic estimates.
   The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude-damage functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses, partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well as the types of flood that affect it. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Development of a modular streamflow model to quantify runoff
   contributions from different land uses in tropical urban environments

AB The decrease of pervious areas during urbanization has severely altered the hydrological cycle, diminishing infiltration and therefore sub-surface flows during rainfall events, and further increasing peak discharges in urban drainage infrastructure. Designing appropriate waster sensitive infrastructure that reduces peak discharges requires a better understanding of land use specific contributions towards surface and sub-surface processes. However, to date, such understanding in tropical urban environments is still limited. On the other hand, the rainfall-runoff process in tropical urban systems experiences a high degree of non-linearity and heterogeneity. Therefore, this study used Genetic Programming to establish a physically interpretable modular model consisting of two sub-models: (i) a baseflow module and (ii) a quick flow module to simulate the two hydrograph flow components. The relationship between the input variables in the model (i.e. meteorological data and catchment initial conditions) and its overall structure can be explained in terms of catchment hydrological processes. Therefore, the model is a partial greying of what is often a black-box approach in catchment modelling. The model was further generalized to the sub-catchments of the main catchment, extending the potential for more widespread applications. Subsequently, this study used the modular model to predict both flow components of events as well as time series, and applied optimization techniques to estimate the contributions of various land uses (i.e. impervious, steep grassland, grassland on mild slope, mixed grasses and trees and relatively natural vegetation) towards baseflow and quickflow in tropical urban systems. The sub-catchment containing the highest portion of impervious surfaces (40% of the area) contributed the least towards the baseflow (6.3%) while the sub-catchment covered with 87% of relatively natural vegetation contributed the most (34.9%). The results from the quickflow module revealed average runoff coefficients between 0.12 and 0.80 for the various land uses and decreased from impervious (0.80), grass on steep slopes (0.56), grass on mild slopes (0.48), mixed grasses and trees (0.42) to relatively natural vegetation (0.12). The established modular model, reflecting the driving hydrological processes, enables the quantification of land use specific contributions towards the baseflow and quickflow components. This quantification facilitates the integration of water sensitive urban infrastructure for the sustainable development of water in tropical megacities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Suitability of TRMM satellite rainfall in driving a distributed

AB Satellite-based precipitation products with high spatial and temporal resolution and large areal coverage offer a potential alternative or supplement to ground-based rainfall estimates over sparsely gauged or ungauged basins. The original intention of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was to provide rainfall products over the global tropics. Although numerous efforts have been made to evaluate the applicability of TRMM precipitation in the low altitude of the tropics and the mid-latitudes, its applicability in high altitude is rare. The source region of Yellow River and its neighbor regions in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau provide a good example of high altitude and higher latitude for this purpose. In this study, we first provided a quantitative assessment of the TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) products (3B42V6) against the gauge rainfall from 1998 to 2008. In general, the TMPA rainfall captures the spatial and temporal rainfall characteristics less well over the region on daily time scales. However, the monthly TMPA data have a much better linear relationship with the gauge rainfall data with a high determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.96. The distribution of the barycentre of the precipitation concentrates on the south-central of the study area, and the TMPA rainfall scatter in the west in comparison with the gauge rainfall. This study also concluded that the validation indices of TMPA were closely associated with latitude and annual precipitation. We subsequently evaluated the utility of the TMPA rainfall for daily and monthly hydrological process simulation by applying the rainfall data to a raster-based distributed hydrological model, Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST). The results showed that the conventional areal rainfall based on gauge data produces an overall good fit, while the TMPA-driven simulations tend to yield an unsatisfied result in the daily discharge simulations. This analysis implies that TMPA cannot be acceptable to drive hydrological models for daily stream flow simulation in the study area. However, at the monthly time scale, the TMPA rainfall performs quite well. This study concluded that TMPA is more suitable for the long-term hydrological prediction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) are assessed in further detail for their potential to (i) trace the relationship between spatial variations in the source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soils and temporal variability of both DOC concentration and composition in streams, and (ii) elucidate water pathway changes during storm events in headwater catchments. For this purpose, we investigated delta C-13(DOC) values in a wetland soil (0-50 cm), in deep groundwater (until 6 m) and during a storm flow event with high-resolution monitoring (<= hourly basis) in a small, lowland catchment in western France (Kervidy-Naizin catchment). The results show a combined increase of stream DOC concentration (from 4 to 14 mg L-1) and decrease of stream delta C-13(DOC) (from -27 to -29 parts per thousand) with increasing discharge, suggesting a change in DOC sources between base flow and storm flow periods. Such an interpretation is consistent with the delta C-13(DOC) values in soils that show a 6 parts per thousand vertical variation, with delta C-13(DOC) values of the uppermost soil horizons (0-10 cm) of the wetland domains being close to those measured in the stream channel during the ascending limb of the hydrograph. Overall, the results presented in this study are consistent with a model in which the water-table rise and wetland runoff caused by rainfall lead to a flushing of the DOC stored in the uppermost soil horizons of the wetland domains near the channel network. Subsequently, these wetland soils become the dominant DOC source during storm events (ca. 70% of the total DOC flux). In this way, the stream DOC isotopic composition reflects the combined effects of the vertical variation of soil organic matter composition as well as the changes in water routing through time. This study demonstrates the ability of the stable isotopes of carbon to serve not only as a tool for the location of stream DOC sources in landscapes but also the reconstruction of water pathways in headwater catchments.

AB The application of the concept of chaos theory in hydrology has been gaining considerable interest in recent times. However, studies reporting the existence of chaos in hydrological processes are often criticized due to the fundamental assumptions with which the chaos identification methods have been developed, i.e. infinite and noise-free time series, and the inherent limitations of the hydrological time series, i.e, finite and noisy. This paper is designed: (1) to address some of the important issues in the application of chaos theory in hydrology; and (2) to provide possible interpretations to the results reported by past studies reporting chaos in hydrological processes. A brief review of some of the past studies investigating chaos in hydrological processes is presented. An insight into the studies reveals that most of the problems, such as data size, noise, delay time, in the application of chaos theory have been addressed by past studies, and caution taken in the application of the methods and interpretation of the results. The study also reveals that the problem of data size is not as severe as it was assumed to be, whereas the presence of noise seems to have much more influence on the nonlinear prediction method than the correlation dimension method. The study indicates that the presence of noise in the data could be an important reason for the low-prediction accuracy estimates achieved in some of the past studies. These observations, with the fact that most of the past studies used the correlation dimension either as a proof or as a preliminary evidence of chaos, suggest that the hypothesis of deterministic chaos, as the basis in those studies, for hydrological processes is valid and has great practical potential.

TI Effect of hydrogeological structure on geogenic fluoride contamination
   of groundwater in granitic rock belt in Tanzania
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DISTRICT; WATERS; AQUIFER; BIOTITE; BASIN
AB In the East African Rift Valley, geogenic fluoride contamination of groundwater is particularly noticeable as a drinking water problem. In the Tabora region, in the central part of Tanzania, which consists of two basins, Lake Tanganyika Basin (LTB) and an Internal Drainage Basin (IDB), within a semi-arid region, fluoride-contaminated groundwater that exceeds the World Health Organization standards is pumped from many wells in the fractured and weathered zones of the granitic layer underlying these basins. Fluoride contamination of groundwater is heterogeneously distributed in the granitic layer, posing an obstacle to groundwater development. In this study, a relationship between the fluoride concentration and the hydrogeological structure was investigated using geophysical survey data to achieve efficient groundwater development in geogenic contaminated areas. Based on the results, the following two mechanisms have been determined regarding fluoride contamination in the Tabora region. 1) With respect to the weathered zones in both the LTB and IDB, the greater the extent of weathering, the more readily fluoride leaches into groundwater. This suggests that fluoride leaching due to the chemical weathering of minerals containing fluoride increases with the weathering of rocks in the field. 2) With respect to the fractured zones in the LTB, a large well yield potential and a deeper water strike depth to the water vein result in lower fluoride concentrations. The suggested flow mechanism for the LTB is that water recharge in a groundwater depression area with a low fluoride concentration flow to substantial depth and over long distances through fault systems, which form preferential flow paths. This implies that the fractured zone along the fault system in the LTB is a high-priority reservoir for the development of safe water resources in the Tabora region. The hydrogeological mechanisms discussed in this study provide a basis for establishing estimation methods for the prediction of safe groundwater resources before a borehole is drilled. However, more reliable data needs to be collected to clarify the effects of hydrogeology on groundwater fluoride contamination for the fractured zone in the IDB.

AB Mark Melton in 1957 found that climate, basin morphometry, and surficial variables control drainage density (D-d), but differences observed between field surveyed channels and those mapped on topographic contours or blue lines left doubts on these results. Later, several landscape evolution model and observational studies analyzed the behavior of D-d. However, only a few studies have been performed over a large number of landscapes of different characteristics and have relied on high resolution topography data.
   We revisit Melton's hypothesis by using meter-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) in 101 sub-basins in the USA. We first propose a dimensionless drainage density (D-dd) metric based on the ratio of likely channelized pixels to total number of basin pixels, which has the advantage of eliminating the computation of the channel network. Our analysis shows that D-dd is a weak scaling function of the input DTM resolution compared to the classic dimensional D-d metric (ratio of total channel length to total basin area). We analyze the correlation of D-dd and mean annual precipitation (MAP) with a Gaussian mixture model which identifies two sub-groups displaying different correlation; negative in arid and semi-arid environments, and positive in humid environments. The transition in correlation is around 1100 +/- 100 mm/yr of MAP and is accompanied by the occurrence of thick soil layers and high available water capacity that promote dense vegetation cover (V-cov) and low D-dd. While small variation in D-dd is observed across vegetation types, increasing V-cov corresponds to decreasing D-dd. We also explore the relationship between D-dd and relief R, and D-dd and lithology. D-dd and R are weakly correlated in arid and semiarid environments, while they have strong positive correlation in humid environments. No significant correlation is found between D-dd and lithology although the results are likely affected by our sample choice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the impacts of land use change on water resources in the Dano catchment, Burkina Faso, using a physically based hydrological simulation model and land use scenarios. Land use dynamic in the catchment was assessed through the analysis of four land use maps corresponding to the land use status in 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2013. A reclassification procedure levels out differences between the classification schemes of the four maps. The land use maps were used to build five land use scenarios corresponding to different levels of land use change in the catchment. Water balance was simulated by applying the Water flow and balance Simulation Model (WaSiM) using observed discharge, soil moisture, and groundwater level for model calibration and validation. Model statistical quality measures (R-2, NSE and KGE) achieved during calibration and validation ranged between 0.6 and 0.9 for total discharge, soil moisture, and groundwater level, indicating a good agreement between observed and simulated variables. After a successful multivariate validation the model was applied to the land use scenarios.
   The land use assessment exhibited a decrease of savannah at an annual rate of 2% since 1990. Conversely, cropland and urban areas have increased. Since urban areas occupy only 3% of the catchment it can be assumed that savannah was mainly converted to cropland. The conversion rate of savannah was lower than the annual population growth of 3%.
   A clear increase in total discharge (+17%) and decrease in evapotranspiration (-5%) was observed following land use change in the catchment. A strong relationship was established between savannah degradation, cropland expansion, discharge increase and reduction of evapotranspiration. The increase in total discharge is related to high peak flow, suggesting (i) an increase in water resources that are not available for plant growth and human consumption and (ii) an alteration of flood risk for both the population within and downstream of the catchment.

AB The relationships between flow hydrology, topography, and channel change in mountain rivers is important to understanding landscape evolution, the structure and persistence of aquatic habitat, and also the physiochemical cycling of upstream derived organic and inorganic materials. There is a paucity of detailed studies that analyze the joint roles of hydrology and topography in controlling multiple mechanisms of channel change in mountain rivers. In this study, gravel and cobble channel change in a bedrock river canyon were analyzed in light of a controlled yet natural experiment where 4491 metric tonnes of rounded gravel and cobble was augmented below a sediment-barrier dam in a 1200 m long mountain river reach that had no prior sources of rounded gravel or cobble and still experiences floods above the bankfull discharge. The overall study goal was to investigate how flow hydrology can modulate multiple channel change processes depending on the topographic features engaged by the flow. Channel change was assessed via differencing of high resolution repeat topographic and bathymetric surveys, along with cm-scale aerial photography post injection. Statistical tests used to implicate topographic feature-specific mechanisms of channel change that vary with discharge included analyzing geomorphic covariance structures of flow dependent width, bed elevation, and channel change as well as autocorrelation of flow width spatial series. Stage dependent topographic steering was inferred from associations of erosion and deposition with changes in 2D model derived flow directions at multiple discharges. A variety of mechanisms of channel change were qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed including particle hiding, topographic steering, eddying, and flow convergence. No single mechanism explained the observed patterns of channel change but rather it is thought that process-blending occurs, as modulated by the interactions of flow hydrology with complex topography. Results from this study suggest that both existing channel boundary variability and input hydrologic variability work together to create hydrodynamic spatial patterns that control the fate and transport of sediments in mountain rivers and ultimately their spatial structure.

AB Surface soil moisture plays a key role in water and energy exchanges at the land-atmosphere interface. Previous research on the microwave remote sensing of soil moisture focused mostly on the forward modeling problem. This paper presents a unique inversion algorithm (Hong's algorithm) for soil moisture retrieval with reduced degrees of freedom of the Fresnel equation; the algorithm is based on the characteristics of the polarization ratio for rough surfaces around the Brewster angle and Hong's approximation, which is an approximate relationship between vertically and horizontally polarized reflectivities. Using the daily observations of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) taken at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees pixel, the soil moisture is estimated globally over the land surface using a relation between the complex dielectric constant and the soil moisture after retrieving the surface roughness and complex dielectric constant. The surface soil moisture products obtained from Hong's algorithm are validated using in situ observations carried out in Oklahoma and Georgia in 2003. The official AMSR-E soil moisture products are compared to assess Hong's algorithm using identical brightness temperature data sets. The biases and the root mean squared error calculated in comparison with the ground observations are in the range of -0.059 m(3)/m(3) to 0.01 m(3)/m(3) and 0.023 m(3)/m(3) to 0.065 m(3)/m(3), respectively. Hong's algorithm estimates the soil moisture within the estimated accuracy of AMSR-E surface soil moisture, 0.06 m(3)/m(3), without requiring a priori information about the roughness and the dielectric constants of the surface. With a minimal use of forward models, this research could also be applied to global soil moisture retrieval in the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite mission and the Soil Moisture Active/Passive mission.

AB The process controls on water balance are examined at the annual, monthly and daily scales. A systematic 'downward' approach for the formulation of models of appropriate complexity is presented based on an investigation of the climate, soil and vegetation controls on water balance. Starting with a simple model, complexity is added in steps, with the models tested progressively against signatures of runoff variability at each time scale. The inter-annual variability of runoff is the first signature considered, followed by the intra-annual (mean monthly) variation of runoff. The flow duration curve is the third key signature and is used to test predictions of the daily water balance model. These analyses are carried out using observed data from the Collie River Basin in Western Australia. At the annual time scale, a simple water balance model including saturation excess overland flow and evaporation is found adequate, provided spatial variability of soil depths and rainfall are introduced through multiple buckets. At the monthly time scale, additional processes are required-the key process is subsurface runoff, but in our case we also separated total evapotranspiration into bare soil evaporation and transpiration to represent the heterogeneous vegetation cover. At the daily time scale, inclusion of non-linearity in the storage-discharge relationship for subsurface runoff generation was important, and more crucially, the inclusion of a deeper groundwater store to capture prolonged low flows was important. Model predictions were very sensitive to the assumed distribution of soil depths, both within each subcatchment, and between subcatchments on a regional basis. Streamflow routing was important for large catchments to capture high flows. The overall conclusion is that in this semi-arid catchment. spatial variability of soil depths appear to be the most important control on runoff variability at all time and space scales, followed by the spatial variability of climate and vegetation cover.

AB Geographic variations in river form are often estimated using the framework of downstream hydraulic geometry (DHG), which links spatial changes in discharge to channel width, depth, and velocity through power-law models. These empirical relationships are developed from limited in situ data and do not capture the full variability in channel form. Here, we present a data set of 1.2 x 10(6) river widths in the Mississippi Basin measured from the Landsat-derived National Land Cover Dataset that characterizes width variability observationally. We construct DHG for the Mississippi drainage by linking digital elevation model (DEM)-estimated discharge values to each width measurement. Well-developed DHG exists over the entire Mississippi Basin, though individual sub-basins vary substantially from existing width-discharge scaling. Comparison of depth predictions from traditional depth-discharge relationships with a new model incorporating width into the DHG framework shows that including width improves depth estimates by, on average, 24 %. Results suggest that channel geometry derived from remotely sensed imagery better characterizes variability in river form than do estimates based on DHG.

AB The spatial extent of the Snow Cover Area (SCA) of the Bhagirathi River Basin (BRB) has changed in recent decades, impacting the hydrology of the region. Previous studies examining variations in SCA in the region have yet been limited to the effects of terrain variables, namely elevation, slope and aspect, without considering the influence of climate variability. This study first investigates temporal changes in SCA and Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) in the BRB during the period 2001-2019, which were calculated using satellite images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), respectively, and their linkages to variation in climatic variables, and then examines how future climate change could impact on the SCA of the basin and its implications for water resources.& nbsp;A trend analysis revealed an increase in the SCA during the study period, correlating with an increase in precipitation and TWS over the basin. Statistically significant positive correlation were detected between the post-monsoon (r = 0.49, p < 0.05) and winter (r = 0.54, p < 0.05) SCA and precipitation, while a negative correlation was identified between SCA and Tmax during the post-monsoon (r =-0.53, p < 0.05) and winter (r =-0.69, p < 0.05) seasons. Climate change scenarios, obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and downscaled over the study region, project an increase in both maximum and minimum temperature, and precipitation for the pre-monsoon and winter seasons in the 2030 s under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios: SSP245 and SSP585. These scenarios, together with a Multiple-Linear Regression (MLR) model developed on the basis of the relationships identified between variations in SCA and climatic variables, indicate a reduction in the SCA at 4000 + m altitudes in all seasons under both scenarios, thereby resulting a decline in the Bhagirathi river flow in spite of a projected increase in precipitation. This study demonstrates the impact of projected changes in climate on the SCA of a Himalayan catchment, and the potential implications for regions where snowmelt is important to streamflow regimes.& nbsp;

AB Accurate prediction of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) can provide a scientific basis for improving water use efficiency, rational allocation of water resources, and sustainable management of ecosystems. However, conventional statistical methods have the limited application in some regions, because of the complex relationships (nonlinear, linear, exponential, etc) between ETc and its each driving factor. This paper illustrated the utility of the back-propagation neural network (BP) model for ETc prediction and compared the performance of this model with that of the multiple linear regression technique. Combined with the ETc measured by Eddy Covariance and the meteorological data, three-layer BP models, trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, were developed with a 4-10-1 architecture (corresponding to four, ten, and one nodes in the input, hidden, and output layers, respectively). The BP models were trained and validated in the MATLAB environment, with three different combinations of maximum air temperature, minimum air temperature, sunshine hours, crop coefficient (K-c), and precipitation. A high correlation was observed between the values measured by Eddy Covariance and those predicted by BP, with a higher coefficient of determination (0.87) and accuracy (91.44%) than that achieved by the multiple linear regression model (0.79 and 82.96%, respectively). Furthermore, the performance of the BP models could be improved substantially by including the dynamic change of Kc and the effect of precipitation, which suggested that these two factors were crucial variables in modeling ETc by BP approaches. In testing sets, the BP model that considered the dynamic change of K-c was found to be superior to the BP model that considered the crop coefficient recommended by FAO-56, with prediction accuracy increased by 19%. Additionally, the accuracy of the BP prediction models that considered the dynamic change of K-c and the effect of precipitation were higher than 95%. Moreover, the BP prediction model in typical weather with precipitation was superior to the BP model in typical weather with no precipitation. The results obtained would be helpful for obtaining the ETc more consistent with the actual growth status of the crop, thereby providing a scientific basis for improving water management during crop production.

AB Risk-management solutions that increase opportunities for adaptation plans and resilience to climate change require an understanding of climate change processes and the trickle down effects of droughts and floods on hydrological and socio-economic systems. To guide future expectations about droughts, this study aims to assess large-scale variability of hydrological stores (groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water) and their responses to drought intensities over large semi-arid domains in Australia. Multi-scaled indicators synthesised from in-situ rainfall (SPI-standardised precipitation index), water budget (SPEI-standardised evapotranspiration precipitation index), model (soil moisture-SM), and satellite observations (groundwater storage-GWS, surface water extent-SWE, and terrestrial water storage-TWS) are employed to assess this variability in climatic hotspots identified through statistical rotation. The link between these hotspots and climate modes are diagnosed using gaussian kernel-based SVMR (support vector machine regression), and quantile function of storage (QFS) is used to assess the response of hydrological stores to climate variability. The capability of these indicators to capture impacts of water deficit on agricultural systems is explored by implementing a PLSR (partial least square regression). Results show that (i) drought characteristics and intensities vary greatly across Australia but hotspots of higher drought duration and intensity are predominant in regions below latitude 25 degrees S, (ii) hydrological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-12) are better predictors of hydrological stores such as TWS and GWS, though the latter shows strong but opposite phase relationship with climate data, (iii) influence of climate teleconnections is better diagnosed and predicted with SPEI/SPI-12, and the Murray Darling basin-MDB (r = 0.84, alpha = 0.05) and central/east coast (r = 0.80, 0.79, alpha = 0.05) are major teleconnection hotspots, (iv) SM and GWS losses in the MDB occurred 60% and about 44% of the time, respectively, during the 2002 2017 period, (v) extreme events (droughts and floods) affect the distribution of SWE, and (vi) meteorological drought indicators (SPEI/SPI-3) are excellent metrics that capture variability in crop production. Choosing appropriate indicators that reflect the response of freshwater ecosystems (including groundwater) to climatic and anthropogenic constraints is part of a key process to guide investments in drought resilience and sustainable management of water resources.

AB Dongting Lake wetland serves critical ecosystem function for water regulation and biodiversity protection, yet it is vulnerable to hydrologic cycle variation (caused by anthropogenic activities and climate change). The impoundment of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has influenced hydrological environment and land cover changes in the wetland. To quantify these influences, long-term land cover variations in the wetland were investigate by applying the Support Vector Machine method to Landsat satellite observations (1978-2018). We also try to explore the driving factors of vegetation changes by combining the classification results with measured hydrological and meteorological data. Some significant results have been revealed as follows:
   (1) In dry seasons, the most significant changes in Dongting Lake wetland were the vegetation expansion and the water area shrinkage, especially during the pre-TGD period (before 2003). Specifically, the vegetation area increased at a rate of 44.22 km(2)/a and the water decreased a a rate of 37.23 km(2)/a for the period of 1979-2001. But the variation trends of wetland cover types changed after 2003. The vegetation decreased at a rate of 24.36 km(2)/a and water increased a a rate of 20.05 km(2)/a from 2003 to 2017.
   (2) In we seasons, vegetation (1433.58 +/- 603.48 km(2)) and water area (2153.32 +/- 603.98 km(2)) fluctuated greatly in the pre-TGD period and the variation range narrowed significantly after 2003 (1632.62 +/- 234.39 km(2) of vegetation, 1958.5 +/- 235.04 km(2) of water).
   (3) Before 2003, the long-term change of vegetation area in dry seasons of the Dongting Lake wetland was strongly linear correlated with inundation area (r = -0.88, p < 0.05), sediment deposition (r = -0.84, p < 0.05) and mean temperature between July and September (r = 0.79, p < 0.05). But these relationships have changed after the operation of the TGD.
   In all, the variation in hydrological conditions caused by the impoundment of the TGD was likely the main reason for the variation of Dongting Lake wetland in recent decades.

AB This study focused on the sensitivity of flood dynamics to soil hydraulic properties derived from three different soil databases in urbanized area: (1) upscaled locally observed soil texture data based on the soil-landscape relationships (SMLS); (2) the SoilGrids250m open data source (SMSG); and (3) the FAO soil map (SMFAO). However, soil in the urban areas has two major conditions related to land cover and soil physical structure for which the information is not available in soil databases: the effect of fragmented vegetation cover and the effect of compaction of bare soil. Non-built-up areas can be covered by fragmented vegetation (grass and shrubs) which generally has high infiltration rates. In contrast, bare areas such as dirt roads and footpath can be heavily compacted and have typically low infiltration rates. We used Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) with satellite-derived vegetation cover and bare soil to predict soil hydraulic properties related to the uncompacted and compacted scenarios. Infiltration dynamics was derived from the predicted soil hydraulic properties for these soil information sources, which then determined the flood dynamics in the catchment. The flash flood modeling was done using the integrated flood modeling system using openLISEM (Bout and Jetten, 2018) for the whole of Kampala (Uganda) using the 25th of June 2012 flood event. In the distributed openLISEM hydrological model, these two urban soil conditions have been treated separately. We have evaluated the sensitivity of flood dynamics to three different soil databases under both uncompacted and compacted urban soil conditions by using different flood indicators such as catchment water balance, infiltration rate, flood depth and duration, flooded area and flood volume, and the average number of structures affected. The result of the study indicates that soil hydraulic properties needed for the distributed hydrological model are better predicted when using the SMSG and SMLS, which resulted in better infiltration simulation. Consequently, compared to an earlier simulation that was verified with stakeholders and accepted for drainage system design, the accuracy of the simulated flood extent map was better when using SMSG and SMLS. Moreover, soil compaction significantly reduces infiltration and consequently increases the flood depth and duration, and therefore, must be included in the urban flash flood modeling study.

AB Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the central Philippines on 8 November 2013 as one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever. It also affected a 23-year-old multi-species 'reforest' at Manobo near Tacloban City on Leyte Island. As part of a larger hydrological investigation of the impacts of reforestation on streamfiow response in the Tacloban area, gross rainfall (P), throughfall (TF; 24 roving collectors) and stemflow (SF; 12 trees) were monitored at Manobo between June 2013 and May 2014. Leaf Area Index (LAI) above each TF collector was measured regularly. Total rainfall interception losses (I) were determined using Gash's revised analytical model for three consecutive periods:(i) pre-Haiyan (baseline), (ii) post-Haiyan (damaged canopy), and (iii) after initial canopy recovery. Modeled I was 18% of P before disturbance, 12% for the period with the most extensive canopy damage, and 17.5% after initial canopy recovery. Stemflow was low, and weighted mean values accounted for 2.7%, 1.3% and 2.0% of P for the respective periods. Contrasts in period-average values of I reflected changes in LAI as well as wet-canopy evaporation rates. Storm-based TF fractions at the 5 m x 5 m sub-plot scale were inversely related to LAI, especially for small storms and low rainfall intensities. Inferred hourly rates of wet-canopy evaporation showed a strong positive relationship to hourly rainfall intensity during large storms. The revised analytical model was also run using pre-disturbance parameter values for the entire year to assess the overall effect of canopy damage on L. Estimated annual losses with and without canopy disturbance were 514 mm (15% of P) and 572 mm (17%), respectively. Thus, observed and inferred changes in rainfall partitioning after canopy disturbance and initial recovery were comparatively modest, likely because the measurement site was relatively sheltered from the winds during typhoon passage and re-foliation relatively rapid. However, given the predicted increase in occurrence of 'super-typhoons' due to continued global warming and oceanic freshening, the structure of forests in affected regions can be expected to be modified, with potential consequences for rainfall partitioning and hydrological response.

AB The importance of lateral pipe flow on runoff generation in wet steep hillslopes has been described in many case studies from around the world. However, most hillslope studies are done in isolation and usually focus on the idiosyncrasies of individual hillslope characteristics and pipe flow response at a single site. Consequently, the first order controls on pipe flow responses remain poorly understood. We present a new intercomparison of pipe flow response to storm rainfall at four well instrumented sites: Panola (Georgia, USA), Toinotani (Kyoto, Japan), Jozankei (Hokkaido, Japan) and Hakyuchi (Tokyo, Japan). Our objective was to minimize the complexities of lateral pipe flow on hillslopes by looking for commonality across different hillslope types. Despite the large differences between the study sites in topography, climate, soil type and soil matrix hydraulic conductivity, we found several common pipe flow responses to storm rainfall: (1) the relationship between total rainfall amount and total pipe flow volume was highly non-linear at each site, (2) initiation of measurable pipe flow was threshold-dependent, controlled by the total rainfall amount and the pre-storm wetness, (3) once significant pipe flow response occurred, the maximum pipe flow rate was sensitive to the measured rainfall intensity, and (4) the ratio of total pipe flow to total hillslope discharge for each site was constant, regardless of total rainfall amount once the precipitation threshold for significant pipe flow response was reached. We used these results to develop a decision tree to determine the general conditions necessary for significant pipe flow to occur. The controls derived from our comparisons agree largely with the controls reported by the previous individual hillslope pipe flow studies in the literature. The commonality of response between our four very different forested hillslope settings indicates that site intercomparison may be effective for extracting common first order controls on complex hillslope processes. We argue that a decision tree may be a useful organizational framework to summarize and organize comparative analyses and may provide a structure for defining the hierarchy of process controls necessary for model development.

AB Two large landslides in October and November 2018 sequentially dammed the Jinsha river at Baige village, eastern Tibet, China. Subsequently, breaching of each dam induced massive outburst floods that posed a severe threat to downstream cities and infrastructure. Field investigation indicates volumes of the first and second landslide dam are about 24.5 x 10(6) m(3) and 8.53 x 10(6) m(3), respectively. However, the peak discharge of the flood generated from the second landslide (3.1 x 10(4) m(3)/s) was significantly larger than that from the first (1.0 x 10(4) m(3)/s). The second peak discharge would have been 5.15 x 10(4) m(3)/s if the dam breached naturally. In this study, we developed two geometry parameters: effective dam height He (elevation difference between over-topping level and river bottom) and a narrowing number distribution Nr(H) (measures the degree to which a river section is occupied by landslide materials to elevation H) which represents river section narrowing effects of successive landslides. Using numerical simulations, we show that He dominates peak discharge, and it has a linear relationship with peak discharge with slope of 1009.4 m(2)/s. Furthermore, the dam includes two sub-areas: a higher part (SB-1) and a lower part (SB-2). Two floods only eroded SB-2. However, breaching of SB-1 and breached SB-2 still narrowed the river. The narrowing effects of the first and second breached dam on the river channel are around 0.35 and 0.5, respectively. Spillway and landslide runup deposits increased the local flood risk by narrowing and lifting the local river section; the first landslide promoted the second landslide, which occupied the same area and forms a dam with high He value. Consequently, a more catastrophic flood could be triggered by a small subsequent landslide. Spatial superposition phenomenon of successive landslides increased the local flood risk. This research quantitatively analyzed the influence of the geometry of dam induced by successive landslides on the process of outburst floods and the risk.

AB Soil water content (SWC) is determined through water exchanges between surface soil and the atmosphere, and changes in SWC will influence both energy conversions and water cycles. Being affected by different climate forcing factors (forcings), SWC is spatially and temporally variable, occurring at various intensities and scales. We compared scale-specific controls on SWC in a sub-humid and a semiarid climate zone based on a multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) method in conjunction with a multivariate dataset, including SWC (collected separately seven times within five soil layers to a depth of 500 cm) and eight measured climate forcing factors (i.e., precipitation, temperature, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, clay, silt, sand and soil organic carbon (SOC)). We also identified the percent variance of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residuals relative to the original data. Two to three IMFs of SWC were further obtained in the two climate zones. IMFs explained the percent variance of SWC (79.3%), NDVI (77.3%), clay content (76.6%) and SOC (93.9%) to the original data in the sub-humid climate zone, while residuals from all environmental variables (except for SOC) yielded most of the total variance (55.5-93.2%) in the semiarid climate zone. Correlations between the two climate zones exhibited different IMF characteristics (scales) and different climatic conditions. Forcings of the two climate zones also played different roles in controlling SWC. Precipitation and temperature controlled large-scale SWC in both climate zones, namely, NDVI had an inverse effect on SWC between the two climate zones, SOC had a moderate and large-scale effect on SWC in the sub-humid climate zone and clay content had a comparatively critical effect on SWC in the semiarid climate zone. Scale-specific controls of soil properties on SWC were depth dependent in the sub-humid climate zone, while similar characteristics were obtained among the five soil layers in the semiarid climate zone. The specific scale dependence of SWC and relevant forcings were similar regardless of soil water condition (dry or wet). Our results offer insight into relationships between SWC and the main forcings of two different regional climate zones and their scale-dependent controls.

AB Predictive models for urban water demand can help identify the set of factors that must be satisfied in order to meet future targets for water demand. Some of the explanatory variables used in such models, such as service area, population and changing temperature and rainfall rates, are outside the immediate control of water planners and managers. Others, such as water pricing and the intensity of voluntary water conservation efforts, are subject to decisions and programs implemented by the water utility. In order to understand this relationship, a multiple regression model fit to 44 years of monthly demand data (1970-2014) for Los Angeles, California was applied to predict possible future demand through 2050 under alternative scenarios for the explanatory variables: population, price, voluntary conservation efforts, and temperature and precipitation outcomes predicted by four global climate models with two CO2 emission scenarios. Future residential water demand in Los Angeles is projected to be largely driven by price and population rather than climate change and conservation. A median projection for the year 2050 indicates that residential water demand in Los Angeles will increase by approximately 36 percent, to a level of 620 million m(3) per year. The Monte Carlo simulations of the fitted model for water demand were then used to find the set of conditions in the future for which water demand is predicted to be above or below the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 2035 goal to reduce residential water demand by 25%. Results indicate that increases in price can not ensure that the 2035 water demand target can be met when population increases. Los Angeles must rely on furthering their conservation initiatives and increasing their use of stormwater capture, recycled water, and expanding their groundwater storage. The forecasting approach developed in this study can be utilized by other cities to understand the future of water demand in water-stressed areas. Improving water demand forecasts will help planners understand and optimize future investments in water supply infrastructure and related programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pressure plates apparatus are very common experimental devices utilized to measure the soil water retention curve. Many studies have demonstrated the lack of reliability of pressure plates apparatus when they are used to measure the soil water retention curve in the dry range, due to low plate and soil conductance, lack of hydrostatic equilibrium, lack of soil-plate contact and soil dispersion. In this research, we investigated measurements of soil water retention curves obtained with a combination of Stackman's tables, pressure plates apparatus and the chilled-mirror dew point technique. Specifically. the aim of this research was: (a) to investigate the differences in the measured soil water retention curves by the different experimental methods, (b) evaluate relationships between the experimental differences and soil texture, (c) analyze the effect of experimental differences on hydraulic properties parameterization and (d) investigate the effects of the different parameters set on water transport computation. The results showed differences in measurements made by the combination of Stackman's tables and Richards' pressure plates apparatus as compared to the dew point method, for fine textured soils, while no significant differences were detected for coarse textured soils. Computed cumulative drainage and evaporation displayed lower values if soil water retention curves were obtained from data obtained with the Stackman's tables and Richards' pressure plates apparatus instead of the dew point method. In soils, where the soil water retention curve was measured with traditional methods (Stackman's tables and Richards' pressure plates apparatus) average cumulative drainage was 173 mm, with respect to a combination of methods including the dew point methods, where the average cumulative drainage was 184 mm. Average cumulative evaporation was 77 mm for the traditional methods, while it was 91 mm, for the combination of methods. Overall, when simulation models are used for studies related to solute transport, polluted soil remediation, irrigation management and others, erroneous measurement of the SWRC for fine textured soils, may lead to erroneous computation of the soil water balance.

AB Impact investigations of climate change on urban drainage require projections to be made on short-duration precipitation extremes. The relevant time scales can be as low as 10 min, which requires strong statistical downscaling of climate model simulation results. In this research, two sets of methods have been suggested and tested based on Belgian data. The first set makes direct use of the precipitation results of the climate models. They involve computation of quantile perturbations on extreme precipitation intensities, and the tested assumption that the same perturbations hold for daily and sub-daily time scales. The second set of methods is based on weather typing, and accounts for the low accuracy of daily precipitation results in current climate modelling. In these methods, climate model outputs on pressure (atmospheric circulation) are used to obtain precipitation estimates from analogue days in the past. Different criteria for defining analogue days have been tested. The weather typing methods have been further advanced accounting for the fact that precipitation change does not only depend on change in atmospheric circulation, but also on temperature rise. Results have been investigated as changes to precipitation intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationships. It is shown that both the quantile-perturbation and advanced weather typing based methods allow precipitation biases in climate model simulation results to be largely corrected. Both types of methods moreover produce similar short-duration changes in precipitation extremes, which gives some credibility to the downscaled impacts. The corresponding changes in IDE statistics show that the extreme precipitation quantiles typically used for design of urban drainage systems, can increase up to 30% by the end of this century. Those changes mean that sewer surcharge or flooding would occur about twice more frequently than in the present climate (if no other environmental or management changes are accounted for). This would have a significant impact on future urban water management and planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The high intensity rainfall has a significant contribution in urban area flooding and understanding this high intensity rainfall over urban areas may help us to reduce the damage caused by urban floods. In this study, the changes in Hyderabad city daily and sub-daily (4-h) extreme rainfall are analyzed using various climate change detection indices. Our analysis indicates that there is increasing trend in intensity and frequency of Hyderabad city daily extreme rainfall. In addition, increasing trend in intensity and frequency of monsoon months' (June-August) 1 a.m. to 4 a.m., 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. and non-monsoon months' 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. extreme rainfall is also observed. Based on recent theoretical development in the Extreme Value Theory (EVT), the changes in extreme rainfall of Hyderabad city are further attributed through modelling the non-stationarity (trend) present in the extreme rainfall intensity and frequency. The extreme rainfall intensity is modelled with peaks-over-threshold (POT) based Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) and frequency is modelled using inhomogeneous Poisson distribution. The trend is incorporated as covariate in the scale parameter (a) of the GPD and the rate parameter (2) of the Poisson distribution. In this study, four physical processes, i.e. Urbanization, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, local temperature changes, and global warming are used as covariates. Further, the combinations of these covariates are also considered for modelling the non-stationarity.
   Based on covariates and their combinations, fifteen non-stationary models and one stationary model are constructed and the best model is chosen based on the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) value. The covariate(s) in the best chosen non-stationary statistical model is/are attributed as the most significant physical process/processes which causes non-stationarity in the series. The study results indicate that the non-stationarity in daily extreme rainfall of Hyderabad city is mostly associated with global processes, i.e. ENSO cycle and global warming and the non-stationarity in sub-daily (4-h) extreme rainfall is mostly associated with local processes, i.e. Urbanization and local temperature changes. It is also observed that, in most of the cases, the stationary model is not even considerable based on AlCc value. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Besides mechanical protection and sugar transport through phloem, barks also transpire some amount of water. Bark transpiration may be a driving force to keep water flux during the leafless period among tropical deciduous trees, but has been hardly investigated. In the current investigation we used the sap flow data to assess the water consumption during leaf loss initiation, total leaf loss period, and leaf flush period in three economically important tropical deciduous timber species i.e, Anogeissus acuminata, Dipterocarpus tuberculatus and Tectona grandis. Eight trees of each species were measured using Granier's heat dissipation sensors, with the circum-ference ranging from 59 cm to 172 cm (mean 59.84 cm) across the three species. The phenological observation for canopy leaves was also carried out on weekly basis. During the completely leafless period, a significant amount of water flux was detected in all three species, which was correlated with vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and light intensity. The whole tree daily mean water consumption during this leaf-less, flower-less and fruit-less period, mainly due to bark transpiration was around 8-14 kg across the three species. It was about 7 to 18 % of the mean whole-tree daily transpiration in the fully foliated canopies during a typical wet-season period. This water flux was supported by sufficient soil moisture as indicated by the pre-dawn leaf water potential higher than -0.4 MPa in the three species. Further, a significant and positive relationship (R2 = 0.32, P < 0.005) was found between tree circumference and whole-tree water consumption during the leaf-less period. The total stand-level water consumption during the leaf-less period ranged from 13 mm to 26.8 mm on a 30 days basis across the three species. Such water flux mainly driven by bark transpiration could have a significant role in maintaining the hydraulic integrity of trees in the dry season, although it could reduce xylem water potential to a risky level of hydraulic dysfunction during a prolonged drought or on dry sites. The study is the first report on bark tran-spiration in intact trees, scaled to the stand-level, which should be included in the modeling of hydraulic function of plant and ecosystem hydrology.

AB In groundwater management, the determination of the origins of nitrate (NO3-) endmember sources is the first step in improving the management over a hydrogeological catchment. The generally multiple source contamination by nitrate over the karst systems makes it difficult to identify the exact nitrate origins in surface water and groundwater.
   This work aims to assess nitrate vulnerability of a karst system fed by several karst aquifers. The Toulon karst system offers the opportunity to study the relationships between two multilayered karst aquifers. It shows an increase in mean NO3- concentrations over decades. However, the origins of the NO3- remain unclear. Natural stable isotopic composition of NO3- (delta N-15(-NO3)- and delta O-18(-NO3)- used to identify the origins of nitrogen causing this increase. This information was also integrated into the local hydrogeological situation to improve knowledge of the contamination of both confined and unconfined karst aquifers.
   delta N-15(-NO3)- and delta O-18(-NO3)- in potential nitrate sources over the hydrogeological catchment were analysed in order to identify the range of values that can be measured in both rivers and groundwater. Over the Toulon Springs catchment, rivers are contaminated with nitrate coming from N synthetic fertilizer mineralized in agriculturalsoils. Most of the springs are also contaminated by this nitrate source, but some record an isotope composition of nitrate coming from sewage effluents. Toulon Springs are only contaminated with nitrate from N synthetic fertilizer mineralized in agricultural soils. Finally, from a hydrogeological point of view, the analysis of delta N-15(-NO3)- and delta O-18(-NO3)- values improves knowledge on the functioning of the study area and shows that the upper Jurassic karst confined aquifer has nitrate of the same origins (sources) as the upper Cretaceous unconfined aquifer. The results here highlight that the lower aquifer can be fed by the Upper Cretaceous unconfined aquifer, contrary to previous belief that the lower aquifer was confined.
   From a more fundamental standpoint, this work provides a set of parameters adapted for karstic hydrogeological catchment. It lays the foundation for the use of isotope biogeochemistry as a powerful tool for understanding the recharge of drinking water catchments and beyond the efficient management of water quality at the scale of karstic hydrogeological catchment.

AB Water stress is one of the major abiotic stresses and directly affects crop growth and influences crop yields. To better quantify the responses of crop yield to hydrological variability in the rainfed Corn Belt of the United States (U.S.), we analyzed the relationships between corn/soybean yield and hydrological cycle metrics, as well as their spatio-temporal dynamic at the agricultural district and interannual scale between 2003 and 2014. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) to optimally integrate different hydrological metrics and drought indices to define a crop-specific new drought index that uses crop yield as the target, and investigated the contributions of those hydrological cycle components to the new drought index. We used both observed and modeled hydrological cycle metrics, as well as several drought indices in this study, including evapotranspiration (ET) and potential ET (PET), terrestrial water storage change (Delta S), surface soil moisture (SSM), river discharge (Q), Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), fET (the ratio of ET to PET), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Our results revealed that: (1) VPD, SSM, and fET showed the strongest correlations with crop yield, among the observation-based hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices considered here. Most of the hydrological cycle metrics and drought indices showed similar seasonal correlation patterns with crop yield, and this pattern revealed that the sensitivity of crop growth to water stress peaked in July for corn and in August for soybean in the rainfed U.S. Corn Belt. (2) The drought in 2012 started with higher water demand (reflected in abnormally high ET, PET, and VPD) and lower water supply (reflected in abnormally low P), followed by soil water depletion (as revealed in SSM and Delta S), leading to massive crop yield losses due to increased constraints on both water supply and demand. (3) The R-2 of the PLSR-based crop yield model reached 0.76 and 0.70 for corn and soybean, respectively. For both corn and soybean, the first PLSR component was mainly composed of information from VPD, fET,Delta S and SSM, indicating atmospheric water deficit and soil water storage both play critical roles in quantifying corn and soybean yield loss due to water stress.

AB Water vapor generated locally by actual evapotranspiration (AET) is important both to the recycling of water regionally and to the long term sustainability of desert-oases in the semi-arid-to-arid region of northwest (NW) China. An accurate assessment of AET is central to describing the hydrologic status of watersheds. Conventional methods of estimating AET from meteorological point data are generally not appropriate for regions with high spatial variability, particularly with respect to landcover and topography. Insufficient monitoring stations make it particularly difficult to estimate AET that is spatially representative of large areas. The objective of this study was to estimate spatially-distributed monthly AET for a complex landscape, consisting of deserts, oases, and mountains, with climate and landcover data generated primarily from remote sensing (RS) data. In this study, we used two complementary relationship (CR)-based methods to estimate monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and AET over a 10-year period (2000-2009) for two large watersheds in NW China. In evaluating the performance of CR-based methods, we compared point-estimates of ETo and AET generated with the two methods (generated either by using climate-station data or by extracting point-estimates from end products produced from RS-data) against (i) climate-station-based estimates of ETo calculated with the FAO Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation and from pan-evaporation data, and (ii) geographically-corresponding point-estimates of AET extracted from the MODIS global product of AET (MOD16) recently developed by Mu et al. (2011, Remote Sensing of Environment, 115, 1781-1800). Point-extractions of AFT from MOD16-products were the least representative, when compared to ETo and AET calculated with the other methods. Between CR-based methods, the Venturini et al. (2008, Remote Sensing of Environment, 112, 132-141) method provided the best comparison with ETo calculated with the P-M equation and from pan-evaporation data. Due to its independence from wind velocity, the Venturini method is rated the most suitable for regional application, especially for the complex landscapes of NW China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Soil erosion models need detailed runoff and infiltration data as input. This information can be deduced from empirical relationships or from dynamic models. Here we investigate to what extent it is possible to derive meaningful parameterizations for the Green-Ampt Mein-Larson infiltration model (GAML) using a dataset consisting of 350 rainfall simulation experiments carried out over a period of 6 years in Central Belgium. We applied three different parameterization strategies for the Green-Ampt Mein-Larson model to evaluate the number of degrees of freedom that would result in optimum model performance. We found that a good description of the evolution of infiltration during an experiment was achieved for most experiments independent of the number of parameters that was allowed to vary. However, acceptable simulations, based on estimated parameter values, could only be obtained for rainfall simulations performed in spring or early summer when the soils were relatively dry and infiltration was dominantly controlled by soil surface conditions. Under these conditions, major controls in effective hydraulic conductivity were soil cover and crusting stage as well as the clay content of the topsoil. Even under these circumstances, good simulations were only possible when only a single parameter value needed to be estimated from the measured data. When more than one parameter value needed to be estimated, predictions were much poorer, mainly due to the large uncertainty associated with the parameter value estimates.
   No good simulations were possible for the winter period: due to the wet state of the soil, infiltration is then no longer controlled by soil surface conditions so that it became impossible to derive meaningful parameter values form the measured field data. This may pose severe limitations on runoff prediction from agricultural land under these conditions. In comparison to a regression-based model based on the available data, the use of the GAML model resulted in slightly worse predictions but the use of a dynamic model allows for greater flexibility. However, one should be aware that local calibration and validation remain necessary and that the prediction uncertainty remains relatively large. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Among the various agricultural activities, livestock production can have a serious impact on water resources because livestock wastes are often stored in earthen waste storage ponds and are often used as organic fertilizers on farmlands. The runoff characteristics of nutrient species were assessed in a canal draining an agricultural watershed with intensive livestock production (A10) adjacent to Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. On the basis of one year's data, the mean concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) of drainage water were 2-6 times higher than those of the receiving river flowing through the watershed with low livestock density and these concentrations in the river increased from upstream to downstream of A10. Over 10 rainfall events, significant positive correlations between temporal concentration levels were found among particulate materials (particulate phosphorus (PP), TP. and particulate nitrogen (PN)), DP and NH4-N, as well as TIN, dissolved nitrogen (M), and NO3-N, suggesting the different transport pathway for these groups. The strength of the first-flushes (the increasing rate of nutrient loads is above that of runoff) was in the order of PP > TP > PN > DP > NH4-N > TN > DN > NO3-N. The event mean concentrations (EMCs) of the particulate materials and of TN, DIN, and NO3-N linearly increased and curvilinearly decreased with direct runoff(DR)/ total runoff(TR), respectively. The EMCs of DP and NH4-N increased with the antecedent rainfall during the 5 days preceding the rainfall event. TN/TP and DN/TN were found to have a significant curvilinear and linear relationship with DR/TR, respectively. The results suggested that the transport of the particulate materials and of TN, DIN, and NO3-N were mainly influenced by DR and base-flow (BF), respectively, and that the transport pathway of DP and NH4-N was similar to that of the particulate materials and was affected by desorption from soil particles. The agricultural watershed with intensive livestock production greatly discharged nutrients and the runoff characteristics of nutrients were diverse among the nutrient species, which should be considered when planning mitigation measures and when developing water quality models.

AB This work is the fourth in a series of papers on the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) approach for modeling flow and transport phenomena in multiscale porous medium systems. The general TCAT framework and the mathematical foundation presented in previous works are built upon by formulating macroscale models for conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the balance of entropy for a species in a phase volume, interface, and common curve. In addition, classical irreversible thermodynamic relations for species in entities are averaged from the microscale to the macroscale. Finally, we comment on alternative approaches that can be used to connect species and entity conservation equations to a constrained system entropy inequality, which is a key component of the TCAT approach. The formulations detailed in this work can be built upon to develop models for species transport and reactions in a variety of multiphase systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High-precision straddle packer tests were conducted in boreholes in a fractured dolostone aquifer using constant rate injection (Q) step tests to identify the conditions of change from Darcian to non-Darcian flow on the basis of Q versus the applied head above ambient (dH), where the ambient head represents static conditions. The linear portion, representing Darcian flow, passes through the origin, but after the onset of non-Darcian flow, there is proportionally less Q per unit dH, and the transmissivity (T) calculated for the test interval using Darcy's law-based models can be substantially underestimated. Onset of nonlinear flow depends on the test interval length and permeability, typically beginning at injection rates less than 0.5 L min(-1) for a relatively transmissive (2 x 10(-5) m(2) s(-1)) 1.5 m test interval. In studies of nonlinear flow during pumping tests, the Forchheimer equation is commonly used to describe nonlinear flow near the well using a Q(2) versus dH relationship. However, for packer tests in fractured rock, we propose the Darcy-Missbach equation, which relates Q(n) to dH, as an alternative equation. While both equations accurately predict the observed dH within the range of flows used, the Darcy-Missbach exponent (n) describes the degree of deviation from the linear regime; moreover, all calculated exponents were less than 2, implying that the flow is nonlinear but not quadratic in nature. This quantification of the linear to nonlinear flow relations provides for a more accurate identification of the Darcian range, resulting in better T estimates.

AB We conducted an empirical hydrological analysis of high-tempoial resolution streamflow records for 27 watersheds within 11 river systems in the Greater Toronto Region of the Canadian Great Lakes basin. Our objectives were to model the event-scale flow response of watersheds to urbanization and to test for scale and threshold effects. Watershed areas ranged from 37.5 km(2) to 806 km(2) and urban percent land cover ranged from less than 0.1-87.6%. Flow records had a resolution of 15-min increments and were available over a 42-year period, allowing for detailed assessment of changes in event-scale flow response with increasing urban land use during the post-freshet period (May 26 to November 15). Empirical statistical models were developed for flow characteristics including total runoff, runoff coefficient, eightieth and ninety-fifth percentile rising limb event runoff and mean rising limb event acceleration. Changes in some of these runoff metrics began at very low urban land use (<4%). Urban land use had a very strong influence on total runoff and event-scale hydrologic characteristics, with the exception of 80th percentile flows, which had a curvilinear relationship with urban cover. Event flow acceleration increased with increasing urban cover, thus causing 80th percentile runoff depths to be reached sooner. These results indicate the potential for compromised water balance when cumulative changes are considered at the watershed scale. No abrupt or threshold changes in hydrologic characteristics were identified along the urban land use gradient. A positive interaction of urban percent land use and watershed size indicated a scale effect on total runoff. Overall, the results document compromised hydrologic stability attributable to urbanization during a period with no detectable change in rainfall patterns. They also corroborate literature recommendations for spatially distributed low impact urban development techniques; measures would be needed throughout the urbanized area of a watershed to dampen event-scale hydrologic responses to urbanization. Additional research is warranted into event-scale hydrologic trends with urbanization in other regions, in particular rising limb event flow accelerations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Annual maximum daily rainfall time series from 221 rain gages in the Midwest United States with a record of at least 75 years are used to study extreme rainfall from a regional perspective. The main topics of this study are: (i) seasonality of extreme rainfall; (ii) temporal stationarity and long-term persistence of annual maximum daily rainfall; (iii) frequency analyses of annual maximum daily rainfall based on extreme value theory; and (iv) clustering of heavy rainfall events and impact of climate variables on the frequency of occurrence of heavy rainfall events.
   Annual maximum daily rainfall in the Midwest US exhibits a marked seasonality, with the largest frequencies concentrated in the period May-August. Non-parametric tests are used to examine the validity of the stationarity assumption in terms of both abrupt and slowly varying temporal changes. About 10% of the stations show a change-point in mean and/or variance. Increasing monotonic patterns are detected at 19 stations. Quantile regression analyses suggest that the number of stations with a significant increasing trend tends to decrease for increasing quantiles. Temporal changes in the annual maximum daily rainfall time series are also examined in terms of long-term persistence. Conclusive statements about the presence of long-term persistence in these records are, however, not possible due to the large uncertainties associated with the estimation of the Hurst exponent from a limited sample. Modeling of annual maximum daily rainfall records with the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution shows well-defined spatial patterns for the location and scale parameters but not for the shape parameter. Examination of the upper tail properties of the annual maximum daily rainfall records points to a heavy tail behavior for most of the stations considered in this study. The largest values of the 100-year annual maximum daily rainfall are found in the area between eastern Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri. Finally, we use the Poisson regression as a framework for the examination of clustering of heavy rainfall. Our results point to a clustering behavior due to temporal fluctuations in the rate of occurrence of the heavy rainfall events, which is modulated by climatic factors representing the influence of both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

AB Quantifying water availability in different soil layers to crop root water uptake (RWU) in different rainfall years helps deliver strategies to combat water scarcity and improve water productivity. To investigate the responses of RWU to soil water availability across distinct rainfall years, a field experiment of winter wheat was conducted in 2017-2018 (wet year), 2018-2019 (dry year), and 2019-2020 (ordinary year) in the North China Plain. Stable isotopes (delta 18O and delta D) in precipitation, irrigation water, xylem water, and soil water, as well as soil water content (SWC), were investigated during the three wheat growth seasons and were used to determine the soil water evaporation line (SWEL: the linear relationship between delta D and delta 18O in soil water), the line-conditioned excess (lc-excess: the deviation between delta D and the local meteoric water line in the dual-isotope space) and the proportion of RWU from different soil layers with the MixSIAR model. The results indicated that there were significant differences in delta 18O and delta D in soil water and xylem water across different rainfall years. The slopes of SWEL and lc-excess of the 0-100 cm soil layer in the dry year were significantly smaller than those in the or-dinary and wet years, which suggests that more substantial soil evaporation occurred in the dry year. The MixSIAR results revealed that the three-year wheat RWU exhibited different patterns, which were related to soil water availability. Wheat mainly utilized soil water from the 0-20 cm and 20-60 cm layers during the greening to filling stage under the dry year, while it mainly utilized the 0-20 cm soil layer under the wet and ordinary years. However, at the harvest stage, wheat under all precipitation years could transfer its main RWU zone to the 20-60 cm soil layer. There were significantly different proportions of RWU from 0 to 60 cm under different rainfall years, shown as 75.3 %, 67.5 %, and 69.5 % in the wet year, dry year, and ordinary year, respectively. These findings indicated that the appropriate irrigation wetting depth should be set as<60 cm for all kinds of rainfall years.

AB The widespread uncertainty regarding future changes in climate, socioeconomic conditions, and population growth have increased interest in water-energy-food-ecology nexus-based frameworks in relation to the analysis of water resources. A challenge for modeling the water-energy-food-ecology nexus is how to reduce the multidimensional and codependent uncertainties and measure the complicated casual relationships effectively. We propose a methodological solution to the problem, and this solution is demonstrated in this case as an extension to the previous water resource optimization framework. We coupled the water-energy-food-ecology nexus into the Bayesian network, which provides a formal representation of the joint probabilistic behavior of the system, and the method was applied to water resource use analysis and management in the Syr Darya River basin, a transboundary and endorheic basin that has contributed to the Aral Sea ecological crisis as a result of unreasonable water use. The annual scale data of four periods, 1970-1980, 1980-1991, 1991-2005, and 2005-2015, were introduced into the Bayesian network. Before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the amount of water inflow into the Aral Sea was sensitive to increases in irrigation for agricultural development, increases in water storage of the upstream reservoirs and stochastic runoff. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the amount of water inflow into the Aral Sea was sensitive to the inefficient irrigation water use in the downstream areas of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and the water storage of the reservoir located upstream of Kyrgyzstan. The change resulted from unresolvable disputes between water use for power generation in the upstream area and irrigation in the downstream area. Comprehensive scenario analysis shows that, in the short term, it would be useful to improve the proportion of food crops, improve the efficiency of water use in relation to salt leaching and irrigation, and prevent drought damage. In the long term, based on the increased use of advanced drip irrigation technology from 50% to 80%, the annual inflow into the Aral Sea will increase significantly, reaching 6.4 km(3) and 9.6 km(3), respectively, and this technology is capable of ameliorating the ecological crisis within the basin.

AB At the Little River Watershed (LRW) heterogeneous landscape near Tifton Georgia US an in situ network of stations operated by the US Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service-Southeast Watershed Research Lab (USDA-ARS-SEWRL) was established in 2003 for the long term study of climatic and soil biophysical processes. To develop an accurate interpolation of the in situ readings that can be used to produce distributed representations of soil moisture (SM) and energy balances at the landscape scale for remote sensing studies, we studied (1) the temporal and spatial variations of ground temperature (GT) and infra red temperature (IRT) within 30 by 30 m plots around selected network stations; (2) the relationship between the readings from the eight 30 by 30 m plots and the point reading of the network stations for the variables SM, GT and IRT; and (3) the spatial and temporal variation of GT and IRT within agriculture landuses: grass, orchard, peanuts, cotton and bare soil in the surrounding landscape. The results showed high correlations between the station readings and the adjacent 30 by 30 m plot average value for SM; high seasonal independent variation in the GT and IRT behavior among the eight 30 by 30 m plots; and site specific, in-field homogeneity in each 30 by 30 m plot. We found statistical differences in the GT and IRT between the different landuses as well as high correlations between GT and IRT regardless of the landuse. Greater standard deviations for IRT than for GT (in the range of 2-4) were found within the 30 by 30 m, suggesting that when a single point reading for this variable is selected for the validation of either remote sensing data or water-energy models, errors may occur. The results confirmed that in this landscape homogeneous 30 by 30 m plots can be used as landscape spatial units for soil moisture and ground temperature studies. Under this landscape conditions small plots can account for local expressions of environmental processes, decreasing the errors and uncertainties in remote sensing estimates caused by landscape heterogeneity.

TI An isotopic study of dissolved inorganic carbon in the catchment of the
   Waimakariri River and deep ground water of the North Canterbury Plains,
   New Zealand
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
ID CO2; EVOLUTION; EXCHANGE; AGES; ICE
AB Processes of evolution of total dissolved inorganic carbon (TDIC) and its isotopic composition have been followed by modelling and measurement in the catchment of the Waimakariri River and the ground water of the section of the Canterbury Plains recharged by infiltration from that river. Although the TDIC concentrations are low (maximum 1.2 mmol kg(-1) water in this study), clear chemical-isotopic relationships emerge, which are consistent with the modelling approach. Total C-14 concentrations in rivers and shallow ground water are linearly related to TDIC, with slope similar to the C-14 concentration of atmospheric CO2 during the sampling period. UC concentrations of Waimakariri River and its tributaries reflect attainment of equilibrium between exchange with atmospheric CO2 and direct addition of CO2 to the water by decay of organic material. As river water infiltrates to the aquifers (fluvioglacial deposits of age several hundred thousand years, mainly greywacke), further TDIC accrues by residual decay of organic material of recent C-14 concentration. Subsequent changes as the water moves to and through the deeper aquifers appear to be limited only to broadening of the age spectrum by natural flow processes, accompanied by radioactive decay of C-14. This allows age assessment of the tritium-free, artesian ground water presently drawn from the deep aquifer in near-coastal areas in and close to Christchurch. Based on the C-14 evidence alone, mean residence times range from about 800 years just outside the confined zone to 2000-3000 years in the confined area. A separate age determination uses the C-13 data to evaluate the contributions to TDIC of each deep water sample by the river and biogenic components at the time of recharge; agreement with the C-14 residence times is achieved when reasonable pre-industrial C-14 concentrations are assigned to these two components. The ages appear to be in conflict with positive tritium indications during the early 1970s and with shorter residence times evaluated from estimates of aquifer storage and withdrawals; this suggests that the flow regime has been altered by sharply increasing withdrawal during the past 4 decades, causing the appearance now of water from deeper levels which has remained underground for longer periods as a component of the undisturbed flow regime.

AB Soil erosion, sediment yield, and sediment transport associated with flash flooding in arid regions result in reservoir storage losses, decreased infiltration, high evaporation rates, and degradation of downstream channels. However, the lack of observational data from wadi systems and an empirical formula to compute sediment yield has hindered reservoir trapping evaluation, maintenance, and management. Therefore, this research aimed to estimate the annual soil loss in the upstream catchment area of a reservoir based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with a remote sensing dataset. The sediment trapped in the Assarin Dam reservoir in Oman was estimated by coupling unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys with photogrammetry analysis to assess the reservoir siltation. Among the previous sediment trapping events, seven sets of field observation data were collected to investigate the relationship between soil loss at the catchment scale and sediment deposition volumes in the reservoir. The RUSLE method was applied to estimate soil erosion using independent factors such as rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topography, cover management and conservation practices. A remote sensing dataset and geographic information system (GIS) environments were used to analyse the quantitative and spatial distribution of the RUSLE parameters. Two drone surveys were conducted over the reservoir before and after a flash flood. The trapped sediment volume was estimated to be approximately 9,075 m(3) (11,343 ton) per event, representing approximately 1.26 % of the total reservoir capacity. This computed volume was validated using measurements from monitored sediment scale bars sited throughout the Assarin Dam reservoir, yielding an accuracy of 79 %. From the RUSLE results, the annual soil erosion was estimated to be 196,599 ton/ha yr(-1), of which approximately 5.8 % was trapped in the reservoir. Spatial-temporal variability in the rainfall patterns and the corresponding runoff discharges led to high sediment delivery at the outlet of the basin. After analysing available data from previous field surveys in Oman, a new formula for estimating the sediment yield in Wadi Assarin was developed. The results of this research, which represent the first of their type in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, can support reservoir management practices and show that UAV-based photo-grammetry is suitable for measuring trapped sediment volumes.

AB Rainfall represents the main driving force of runoff and soil erosion. Previous studies usually focused on the effects of general rainfall characteristics at event scale on runoff and soil erosion, but the effects of rainfall intensity fluctuation at intra-event scale, i.e., the temporal distribution of intensity bursts across the rainfall profile, have always been difficult to be characterized. In this study, the rainfall intensity profile was disaggregated into high-intensity zone and low-intensity zone using the average rainfall intensity as threshold, and a series of indicators were proposed to describe the features of rainfall intensity fluctuation. Field observations of runoff and soil loss in six grass-cover plots under natural rainfall conditions were conducted from 2011 to 2016 in the Loess Plateau of China. The main rainfall indicators influencing runoff coefficient (RC), sediment concentration (SC) and soil loss coefficient (SLC) were identified using the principal component analysis, and runoff and soil loss regression models were developed using data from 2011 to 2013 to predict RC, SC and SLC during 2014-2016. The results indicated that the natural rainfall events displayed strong intensity fluctuations (e.g., aggregation, intermittency, and variability), with approximate 78% of rainfall amount occurring in only 27% of rainfall duration. Most of the proposed rainfall intensity fluctuation indicators were significantly correlated with RC, SC and SLC (p < 0.05). The average intensity of rainfall peaks (I-ap) and rainfall duration of high-intensity zone (RDh) were the main variables to simulate RC, and the average intensity of high-intensity zone (I-ah) and relative amplitude of rainfall intensity (R-am) controlled SC and SLC. The models considering rainfall intensity fluctuation had good performances in predicting RC, SC and SLC with higher R-2 values (0.64 vs 0.46), lower RMSE values (0.66 vs 0.76) and higher NSE values (0.54 vs 0.42) compared to the models only considering general rainfall characteristics. The prediction accuracy of SLC was higher than that of RC and that of SC was lowest. These results gain an insight into the marked influence of rainfall intensity fluctuation in generating and predicting runoff and soil loss, and shed light on exploring rainfall-erosion relationships.

AB Changes in total and extreme precipitation are expected to intensify under climate warming. As Central Asia is among the driest regions in the world, more information is needed regarding the past and potential future changes in extreme precipitation in this region. In this study, we investigated changes in total and extreme precipitation in Central Asia based on observational records and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) model simulations. The results showed that all extreme precipitation-related indices except for consecutive dry days (CDD) experienced an increasing trend during 1936-2005. The annual total wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT), daily intensity index (SDII), annual maximum 1- or 5-day precipitation amount (Rx1day and Rx5day), total annual number of days with precipitation exceeding heavy precipitation or very heavy precipitation thresholds (R10 and R20), and CDD were statistically robust. Generally, the statistically significant increasing trends are more pronounced in the wetter sub-regions, i.e. Northern and Southeastern Central Asia. Based on the CMIP5 model simulations, the PRCPTOT, Rx1day, and CDD in Central Asia are projected to increase robustly during 2006-2100 under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5; higher RCPs had higher rates of extreme precipitation and lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In addition, a considerable intensification of extreme precipitation and slight drought is predicted for the late 21st century (2071-2100). In Central Asia, the PRCPTOT, Rx1day, and CDD had an approximately linear relationship with global warming rates, with rates of 4.95%/K, 5.79%/K, and 2.79%/K, respectively, under RCP 4.5. The response rates were slightly lower under RCP 8.5 than under RCP 4.5 for these indices. The increase in total precipitation was mainly due to the intensification of extreme precipitation and a concomitant weakening of light precipitation, with a simultaneous overcompensation of increased evaporation due to global warming. Thus, our results suggest that total and extreme precipitation will intensify in Central Asia under a warming climate. Since increased extreme precipitation may lead to a heightened risk of flooding, water availability is predicted to remain limited over Central Asia.

AB The importance of soil macropores as preferential pathways for water, air, and chemical movement in different soils has long been recognized. However, quantification of complex macropore structures and their relationships to soil types and land uses remains elusive. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify 3-D macropore networks in intact soil columns using an improved approach and (2) investigate the effects of soil type and land use on soil macropore characteristics. Two soils with contrasting textures and structures (Hagerstown silt loam and Morrison sand) from two land uses (row crop and pasture) were investigated. Intact soil columns, 102 mm in diameter and about 350 mm in length, were taken for each soil type-land use combination. The soil columns were scanned using X-ray computed tomography at a voxel resolution of 0.234 mm x 0.234 mm x 2.000 mm. After reconstruction, characteristics of macropore networks were quantified, including continuous macroporosity change along depth, macropore size distribution, network density, surface area, length density, length distribution, mean hydraulic radius, tortuosity, inclination (angle), and connectivity (path number and node density). The approach we developed provided an improved quantification of complex 3-D macropore networks. The analysis of variance indicated that soil type, land use, and their interaction significantly influenced macroporosity, network density, surface area, length density, node density, and mean angle. The interaction of soil type and land use also influenced mean tortuosity and hydraulic radius. Within the same soil type, the soils under pasture land use had greater macroporosity, length density, and node density than that under row crop, especially in the subsoil. This was due to greater organic matter content and more biota activities in the pasture. Within the same land use, the Morrison sand displayed lower overall macroporosity than the Hagerstown silt loam because of weaker structure and higher amount of rock fragments in the Morrison soil and thus less suited for biota activities. The results from this study provide improved quantitative evaluation of a suite of soil macropore features that have significant implications for non-equilibrium flow prediction and chemical transport modeling in field soils.

AB The hydrogeochemistry of deep groundwater needs to be characterized for geological CO2 storage or radioactive waste disposal. However, various origins and their interactions and complex hydrogeological conditions make it difficult to assess. Moreover, it is challenging to interpret a large national dataset of hydrochemical variables due to wide composition ranges. This study aimed to define the representative geochemical facies of deep groundwater (average well depth of 624 +/- 262 m) obtained from spa areas over South Korea by applying both linear (principal component analysis; PCA) and non-linear (self-organizing map; SOM) dimensionality reduction methods to a large dataset (n = 355) with 16 hydrochemical variables. The SOM results combined with hierarchical cluster analysis showed that deep thermal groundwater in South Korea is classified into five major geochemical groups (G1 to G5) with four mixing groups (Ml to M4). G1 to G5 represent high-TDS saline (7% of the samples), acidic CO2-rich (4%), high-pH alkaline (14%), sulfate-rich (9%), and dilute freshwater (11%), respectively. More than half of the samples (56%) belonged to the four mixing groups. In particular, the SOM reduced the number of samples (n = 355) to 104 neurons, visualizing the cluster structure of samples and the relationship among hydrochemical variables in a 2D array of neurons, which made it possible to distinguish the facies (G4 and G5 and Ml to M4) that could not be defined by PCA due to the extremely distinct geochemistry of G1 and G2. Based on the compositional changes of neurons between the geochemical (G1 to G5) and mixing (Ml to M4) groups, major reaction pathways were identified for each geochemical group. The hydrochemistry of each group mainly evolves through distinct water-rock interactions but is modified by varying degrees of mixing with dilute shallow groundwater during ascent. This study provides a state-of-the-art method to interpret a large and complex hydrogeochemical dataset; the SOM is expected to be a useful alternative to PCA. Besides, the results of this study can be useful to select a site suitable for geological CO2 storage or radioactive waste disposal.

AB GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) long-term terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) is attributed to the complex interaction of climatic, physical and anthropogenic drivers. This paper, therefore, explores how different hydroclimatic and anthropogenic processes interact and combine over "space" to produce the mass variations that GRACE-TWSA detects. Using the Nile River Basin (NRB) as a case study, it explicitly analyzes nine hydroclimatic and anthropogenic processes, as well as their relationship to the TWSA in different climatic zones. The analytic method employed the long-term trends derived for both the dependent (TWSA) and independent (explanatory) variables via applying two geographically multiple regression (GMR) approaches: (i) an ordinary least square regression (OLS) model in which the contributions of all variables to TWSA variability are deemed equal at all locations; and (ii) a geographically weighted regression (GWR) which assigns a weight to each variable at different locations based on clustering occurrences. The models' efficacy was investigated using standard goodness of fit diagnostics. The OLS explains that the basin at large TWSA spatial variability significantly attributed to five variables, i.e., precipitation, runoff, surface water storage, soil moisture storage, and population density, (p < 0.0001). The OLS model, however, produced an R( )(2)value of 0.14 with skewed standardized residuals. In contrast, the GWR model retained varying explanatory variables by different climate zone. For instance, the results showed that all nine variables contribute significantly, with varying ranking, to the trend in TWSA in the tropical zone. The evapotranspiration (ET) and population density are the only significant variables in the semiarid zone; population density contributes significantly to TWSA variability in all zones. The GWR model yielded R-2 values with a median of 0.71 and normally distributed standard residuals. To evaluate the robustness of the GWR approach, the basin-wide TWSA pattern was simulated using the GWR model outputs. Herein, the GWR highlights the importance of the spatial locations to attribute the spatial variability in GRACE TSWA long-term trends. This spatial information, therefore, is critical for developing robust statistical models for reconstructing time series of proxy GRACE anomalies that predate the launch of the GRACE and for gap-filling between GRACE and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission.

AB Sources of water used by plants in rock-dominated environments are far less clear than those in relatively homogeneous soils, largely because plants in rocky environments normally expose to more complex substrate conditions and their potential water sources are hard to locate and sample. In the current study, potential water sources for plants growing on cliff-face (a typical kind of rock-dominated environment) were roughly separated into two water pools based on their hydrological differences. A variable pool that is composed of water derived from recent precipitation that has rapid fluctuations in water content due to recharge by precipitation and depletion by transpiration, and a constant pool that is characterized by slower changes in water status because it can only be recharged by precipitation under certain conditions and depleted by transpiration of deep-rooted species. This study was conducted in a typical karst catchment of Northwest Guangxi, Southwest China. Stem water samples for the most common dominant tree species of cliff-faces and rainwater for each rain event were consecutively collected throughout the growing season. A co-occurring shrub species, which was identified to have a shallow root system, was further selected as a reference species. The reliance on different water pools was qualitatively identified based on the deviation of stem water isotope values between current and last sampling times, as well as its relationship to the isotope values of rainfall between these two sampling times. Our results showed that the shrub species continuously relied on water from the variable water pool, which was consistent with its shallow root system. While the dominant tree species shifted from the constant pool during the early wet season to the variable pool during the mid-wet season, then back to the constant pool during the early dry season. Moreover, the divergent reliance on different water pools by the two species was further supported by the species-specific dynamics in the efficiency in water use by various plants (reflected by leaf carbon isotope ratio). Our results provide new insights into the linkages between plant transpiration and hydrologically different water pools, which would be helpful in understanding the hydrological importance of different plant species.

AB Suspended sediment transport is an important contributor to ecologic and geomorphic functions of streams. However, it is challenging to generalize predictions of sediment yield because it is influenced by many factors. In this study, we quantified the relevance of natural controls (e.g., geology, catchment physiography) on suspended sediment yield (SSY) in headwater streams managed for timber harvest. We collected and analyzed six years of data from 10 sites (five headwater sub-catchments and five watershed outlets) in the Trask River Watershed (western Oregon, United States). We used generalized least squares regression models to investigate how the parameters of the SSY rating curve varied as a function of catchment setting, and whether the setting modulated the SSY response to forest harvesting. Results indicated that the highest intercepts (a) of the power relation between unit discharge and SSY were associated with sites underlain primarily by friable rocks (e.g., sedimentary formations). The greatest increases in SSY after forest harvesting (up to an order of magnitude) also occurred at sites underlain by the more friable lithologies. In contrast, basins underlain by resistant lithologies (intrusive rocks) had lower SSY and were more resilient to management-related increases in SSY. As such, the impact of forest management activities (e.g., use of forested buffers; building of new roads) on the variability in SSY was primarily contingent on catchment lithology. Sites with higher SSY, or harvest-related increases in SSY, also generally had a) lower mean elevation and slope, b) greater landscape roughness, and c) lower sediment connectivity. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to further explore the relationship between SSY and several basin physiographic variables. The PCA clearly separated sites underlain by friable geologic units from those underlain by resistant lithologies. Results are consistent with greater rates of weathering and supply of sediment to headwater streams in catchments with more friable lithologies, and limited sediment supply in catchments underlain by resistant lithologies. We hypothesize that a similar framework may aid in predicting the overall SSY of a catchment as well as its susceptibility to increases in SSY following forest harvesting. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB [1] Because of limitations in sampling of atmospheric moisture, surface humidity is used to estimate atmospheric moisture availability for probable maximum precipitation (PMP) estimation. In practice, a pseudoadiabatic moisture profile is assumed to estimate precipitable water from surface 12-hour persisting dew point. This assumption was evaluated for the central United States using surface and upper air observations. The results show that the pseudoadiabatic assumption systematically overestimates precipitable water for PMP estimation. The overestimation occurs for extreme rainstorms and for climatological maximum conditions because the surface humidity is high but the upper air is drier than predicted by a pseudoadiabatic profile. To better represent the moisture relationship for the central United States, an empirical power law moisture profile was derived from a 23-year climatology of the monthly maximum precipitable water and monthly maximum 12-hour persisting dew point. Moisture maximization concepts were then used to recompute PMP estimates for the Chicago area. The results suggest that the pseudoadiabatic assumption overestimates PMP by about 6.9% on average. An analysis of atmospheric conditions for extreme rainstorms also raises concerns regarding the PMP moisture maximization assumption that such storms could occur under maximum atmospheric moisture conditions.

ID BREACH
AB Landslide dams often fail shortly after the formation, resulting in huge risks to the downstream residents and properties. Fast and accurate forecasting of the breaching process and discharge hydrograph is important for a decision making to mitigate the damages. Morphological data indicate that the longitudinal length of most landslide dams is much larger than their transverse length. Additionally, headward erosion is more intense in landslide dams than manmade dams during the overtopping failure process. However, most existing models neglect this phenomenon. The objective of this study is to build up a dam-break model considering the headward erosion process, assuming that the change rate of downstream slope-angle is consistent with the rate of breach vertical erosion. And a dam-break numerical model to simulate the overtopping failure process of landslide dams considering the headward erosion was developed based on the theories of hydraulics, hydrology, soil mechanics, sediment dynamics, and etc. Nevertheless, the breach final bottom elevation, which can only be measured after the dam failure, is directly applied in currently available dam break models. To overcome this problem and for the prediction purpose of a newly formed landslide dam, we proposed an empirical model to estimate the breach final bottom elevations of high, medium and low erodibility landslide dams based on the statistical analysis of worldwide landslide dam failure cases collected recently. To verify the effectiveness of proposed dam-break numerical model, the `11.03' Baige landslide dam which locates at the border of Tibet Autonomous Region and Sichuan province was selected as a case study. Results of this study show that the relative errors in the simulated peak discharge, time to the peak, and the total flood volume are 1.59%, 3.50% and 0.53%, respectively, which meet the accuracy requirements of hydrological forecasting. The relative error in the prediction of breach final bottom elevation is 4.28%, which indicates that the accuracy of the simulation is satisfactory. Finally, a sensitivity analysis indicates that the downstream slope affects the prediction of the breach and flood hydrograph significantly, and the excavation of diversion channel is an effective measure to reduce the peak discharge of dam overtopping failure.

AB Aggregate stability is frequently shown to be enhanced by strong soil water repellency, however, there is limited systematic evidence on this effect for moderately (subcritically) water repellent soils. This study aimed to investigate the specific effects of interfacial properties on the liquid penetration kinetics in relation to the stability of subcritically water repellent aggregates (4-6.3 mm) from various arable and forest soils against breakdown by slaking. In contrast to many other studies, where aggregate stability was determined by wet sieving, we here assessed the stability by immersion of air-dry aggregates in water-ethanol solutions with surface tensions ranging from 30 to 70 mN m(-1). This approach allowed a highly sensitive discrimination of different stability levels and the determination of breakdown kinetics also for less stable aggregates. Interfacial properties were characterized in terms of contact angle measured on crushed aggregates, theta(c), and calculated for intact aggregates, theta(i), based on infiltration measurements with water and ethanol. Aggregate stability turned out to be higher in forest soils compared to arable soils with topsoil aggregates generally found to be more stable than subsoil aggregates. For water repellent aggregates, characterized by contact angles >40 degrees and low water infiltration rates (<0.2 mm(3) s(-0.5)), the fraction of disrupted aggregates after 30 s of immersion was generally below 10%, whereas in case of the more wettable aggregates, characterized by contact angles <10 degrees and higher infiltration rates (>0.25 mm(3) s(-0.5)) more than 80% of the aggregates were disrupted. In accordance, we found a close relationship between aggregate stability and wettability with differences between theta(c) and theta(i) being generally small. In addition, aggregate stability turned out to be related to organic carbon content. However, correlation analysis revealed that both persistence of aggregate stability and kinetics of aggregate breakdown were more strongly affected by the contact angle, theta(c) (r = 0.90 and r = -0.83, respectively) and theta(i) (r = 0.89 and r = -0.76, respectively) than the organic carbon content (r = 0.62 and -0.52, respectively), suggesting that stability was primarily controlled by aggregate interfacial properties. Calculation of liquid penetrativity as a function of surface tension and contact angle clearly demonstrated the importance of both solid and liquid interfacial properties in determining the stability of subcritically water repellent aggregates against slaking.

ID DERIVATION
AB Most available methods for synthetic unit hydrograph (SUH) derivation involve manual, subjective fitting of a hydrograph through a few data points. Because of this tedious procedure, the generated unit hydrograph is often left unadjusted for unit runoff volume. During recent decades, use of probability distribution functions (pdfs) in developing SUH has received much attention because of its similarity with unit hydrograph properties. In this study, the potential of four popular pdfs, i.e., two-parameter Gamma, three-parameter Beta, two-parameter Weibull, and one-parameter Chi-square distribution to derive SUH have been explored. Simple formulae are derived using analytical and numerical schemes to compute the distribution parameters, and their validity is checked with simulation of field data. The Gamma and Chi-square distributions behave analogously, and the Beta distribution approximates a Gamma distribution in a limiting case. Application to field data shows that the Beta and Weibull distributions are more flexible in hydrograph prediction than the Gamma, Chi-square, Gray [Gray, D.M., 1961. Synthetic hydrographs for small drainage areas. In: Proceedings of the ASCE, 87, HY4, pp. 3354], SCS [SCS, 1957. Use of Storm and Watershed Characteristics in Synthetic Hydrograph Analysis and Application: V. Mockus. US Dept. of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Washington, DC], and Snyder [Synder, F.F., 1938. Synthetic unit hydrographs. Trans. Am. Geophys. Union 19, 447-454] methods. A sensitivity analysis of pdf parameters on peak flow estimates of an UH indicated that Gamma and Chi-square distributions overestimate the peak flow value, for any overestimation in its parameter estimates. However, for the Beta and Weibull distributions a reverse trend was observed. Both were found to behave similarly at higher alpha (ratio of time to base and time to peak of UH) values. Further, an analogous triangular hydrograph approach was used to express the mean and variance of the UH in terms of time base and time to peak of the UH. This enabled a simple parameter estimation equation involving only time base and time to peak of the UH. Although the validity of this equation could not be evaluated with a proper amount of data, the results give an indication of the relationship between pdf and statistical properties of the UH to be further elaborated in future research.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) prediction and forecasting play a vital role in improving water use in agriculturally intensive areas. Metrological and biophysical predictors that drive ET in managed landscapes have complex nonlinear relationships. Deep learning and data-driven methods have shown promising performance for identifying the dependencies among variables. Here, we evaluated the potentials of random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to estimate and forecast daily ET for corn, soybeans, and potatoes in diverse agricultural farms during 2003-2019. The modeling framework was applied for nineteen fields where eddy covariance ET and meteorological observations in the Midwest USA for growing season (April-October) is available. In this study, we applied data-driven models (RF and LSTM) with 3 sets of predictors (5, 11, and 16 predictors). Results show that a 16 predictor RF model (RF_16 R-2 = 0.7, Willmott's skill score = 0.90) outperformed a process-based land surface model (LSM_R-2 = 0.57, Willmott's skill score = 0.86) for predicting daily ET, while LSTM performance was lower (LSTM_16 R-2 = 0.65, Willmott's skill score = 0.89 and LSTM_11 R-2 = 0.62, Willmott's skill score = 0.86) than RF using the same sets of predictors. Vapor pressure and crop coefficients were identified as the most important predictors for irrigated crops, while short wave radiation and enhanced vegetation index were key predictors for non-irrigated crops. For certain crop types, such as corn and soybeans on fine-grained soils (silt loam), a simpler version RF, using only 11 drivers, can provide comparable results (R-2 = 0.70 vs 0.69 and Willmott's skill score = 0.90 vs 0.88). For short-term 3-day ET forecasting, LSTM is more sensitive to uncertainty in ensemble forecast meteorology than RF. ET forecasts were strongly sensitive to forecast uncertainty of vapor pressure. The proposed modeling architecture provides a field-scale, locally calibrated tool for accurate prediction and short-term forecasting of daily ET in areas where in situ ET, metrological, and biophysical data are lacking.

AB Floodplains may alternate between discharge zones for regional groundwater and areas of recharge from river water during high-flow events. Understanding the mechanisms and timescales of recharge on floodplains is important for their management and for the protection of fragile ecosystems. The floodplains of the River Murray host important ecosystems, particularly remnant eucalypt forests that are vulnerable to changes in inundation, rising regional water tables, and salt accumulation. This study addresses floodplain recharge and groundwater mixing on the Pike and Katarapko floodplains of South Australia. At Pike,H- 3 activities of groundwater in the low hydraulic conductivity Coonambidgal Formation that crops out on the floodplain are similar to 0.25 TU, H-3 activities of groundwater in the underlying higher hydraulic conductivity Monoman Formation decrease from similar to 1 TU near the contact with the Coonambidgal Formation to < 0.02 TU at > 15 m depth. Groundwater C-14 activities are between 40 and 95 pMC but are less well correlated with depth. The H-3 or C-14 activities do not vary systematically with distance from the surface water channels on the floodplains. These observations imply that groundwater recharge at Pike is dominantly through the floodplain rather than through the channel banks. In contrast to the regional groundwater where total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations are commonly > 35,000 mg/L, the TDS of groundwater on the floodplain is locally < 500 mg/L. A correlation between H-3 activities and TDS and the presence of groundwater with relatively low C-14 activities but above detection H-3 activities implies that recently recharged waters have mixed with regional groundwater in the floodplain sediments. The H-3 activities in these mixed waters implies that mixing occurs over a few years. By contrast, at Katarapko, the highest 3 H activities in the Monoman Formation groundwater (up to 2.35 TU) are closer to the Murray River, implying that recharge through the bank may occur. These contrasting patterns of recharge probably reflect local topographic controls. Understanding the recharge-discharge relationships are vital for managing proposed floodplain inundation programs aimed at improving ecosystem health.

AB The shallow aquifer in the vicinity of Lake Nyos (Northwest, Cameroon) is one of the main water supply sources to meet the water needs of the inhabitants to be resettled after 1986s tragedy. Unfortunately, there is a lack of knowledge on the groundwater recharge and flow systems in the area. Multiple environmental tracers (delta O-18, ED, Cl-, CFCs and SF6) and a yearly record of rainfall, surface waters and groundwater were employed to characterize the recharge mechanism of the shallow groundwater seeping in the fractured rock of the Lake Nyos catchment (LNC). The delta O-18-delta D relationship of the rainfall events gave the Nyos Meteoric Water Line: delta D = 8.28 delta O-18 + 11.87. Inland moisture vapor may have impacted the isotopic composition of original vapor masses from Gulf of Guinea prior to precipitation. Shallow groundwater in the LNC shows a similar trend of enrichment in O-18 and D as surface waters indicating a well-mixed aquifer. The proportions of surface waters and rainfall in the groundwater reservoir were 87% and 13%, respectively. The high annual recharge rate (941 mm/yr) and the seasonal variability in the isotopic signatures of groundwater indicate a renewable aquifer system. CFCs apparent ages-based piston flow model revealed a young age (average of 24 a.) of the groundwater in the LNC. SF6-based ages were biased young as compared to relatively younger than CFCs-based ages, implying an additional terrigenic production of SF6. The conceptual model for groundwater flow suggests that three main flow regimes, mainly controlled by the physical properties of the rock heterogeneities govern the movement of water in the aquifer. The piston flow model appears, however, to be the better model to explain the flow regime in the highly faulted and fissured area where recharge occurs (similar to 1200-1600 masl). The rapid circulation and the low solubility lead to low mineralization. In the middle-lower area where waters circulate more in the weathered layer, exponential mixing model dominates, yielding more mineralized water. Downward to the valley, with prevailing gentle slope, interaction between surface and recently infiltrated groundwater better explain the observed similarity in the isotopic compositions and the mineralization of water.

AB Devising strategies for drought planning and risk mitigation in predominantly small holder agriculture regions like South Asia requires improved understanding of spatio-temporal characteristics of droughts at finer spatial scales. In this study, an integrated framework is developed to generate high-resolution gridded precipitation products from publicly available coarse scale data, and use the downscaled products for analysis of meteorological droughts. Data from a region in Central India is used to develop and test the framework. The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) is used to characterize meteorological drought. The proposed framework incorporates: (i) a Random Forest machine learning algorithm to downscale CHIRPS (5 km) gridded long term rainfall data to a higher resolution gridded product (1 km) using high resolution multi-sensor and multi-temporal earth observation data of land surface characteristics (vegetation, temperature, and topography) as cofactors; (ii) Computation of 3-month SPI (SPI-3) for the downscaled gridded rainfall; (iii) Run theory applied to downscaled SPI grid to determine drought characteristics - duration, severity, intensity, frequency, and onset and cessation of droughts, and (iv) Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to combine effects of multiple drought characteristics into a single composite Effective Meteorological Drought Index (EMDI), to identify sub-regional drought patterns. The downscaled gridded precipitation product (1 km) was validated using: (i) original CHIRPS (5 km) data, and (ii) measured rainfall data from 65 rain gauge stations in the study area, with respect to conservation of both statistical properties and spatial structure. Comparisons were also made with drought characteristics obtained from Standardized Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) derived from MODIS evapotranspiration data. The downscaled product captures spatio-temporal variability of droughts at finer village and sub-village scales, compared to original CHIRPS (5 km) data for which each pixel encompassed multiple villages. Spatial distribution of composite index EMDI delineates the study area into two characteristic drought risk regions. In one region, droughts are of longer duration, but are less frequent, with lower severity and intensity. In the second region droughts are of shorter duration but of higher severity, intensity and frequency. The integrated framework developed in this study for high resolution spatio-temporal analysis of droughts, starting from coarse scale precipitation data, is practical and sufficiently general to adopt in other regions to support local drought risk planning and targeting mitigation decisions and actions.

AB Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an important state variable for understanding various land surface and ecohydrological processes. Due to the lack of field measurements, different methods have been proposed to estimate RZSM, including the use of exponential filters to predict RZSM from remotely sensed near surface soil moisture data. However, inconsistent findings about the controls on the optimal characteristic time length Taps, which is used in the exponential filter method, have been reported in the literature. To reconcile these inconsistent findings and further improve the use of the method, the impacts of soil properties and climatic conditions on T-opt were assessed in this study using observed and modelled soil moisture datasets. Daily soil moisture data, daily meteorological records, and soil properties were retrieved from the Automated Weather Data Network (AWDN) and the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) within the continental United States. Data from the AWDN stations showed that Tut was mostly controlled by soil texture (e.g., a negative correlation with the sand fraction and a positive one with the clay fraction) as compared to climatic conditions. However, at SCAN stations, T-opt was mostly affected by precipitation (P), and no significant correlation was found between T-opt and soil texture. The difference in controlling factors between ADWN and SCAN stations can be largely attributed to the higher spatial variability in P across the SCAN stations, which overrode the impacts of soil properties on T-opt. A 1-D vadose zone model was also utilized to simulate soil moisture at selected SCAN sites using a generated soil hydraulic parameter dataset. The simulation results further demonstrated the negative relationship between Toot and P observed for the SCAN stations. Moreover, the simulation results revealed that T-opt was larger under vegetated conditions than under bare surface conditions. Under the same climatic conditions at each simulated site, which could be deemed as reduced variability in P, significant correlations existed between T-opt and van Genuchten parameters. In particular, T-opt was shown to be smaller for coarser soils, which was consistent with the results observed from AWDN stations. The findings of this study offer additional insights into the use of the exponential filter method for estimating RZSM from near surface soil moisture measurements. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sensors in the range of visible and near-shortwave-thermal infrared regions can be used in combination with passive microwave observations to provide soil moisture maps at much higher spatial resolution than the original resolution of current radiometers. To do so, a new downscaling algorithm ultimately based on the land surface temperature (LST) - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) - Brightness Temperature (T-B) relationship is used, in which shortwave infrared indices are used as vegetation descriptors, instead of the more common near infrared ones. The theoretical basis of those indices, calculated as the normalized ratio of the 1240, 1640 and 2130 nm shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands and the 858 nm near infrared (NIR) band indicate that they are able to provide estimates of the vegetation water content. These so-called water indices extracted from MODIS products, have been used together with MODIS LST, and SMOS T-B to improve the spatial resolution of similar to 40 km SMOS soil moisture estimates. The aim was to retrieve soil moisture maps with the same accuracy as SMOS, but at the same resolution of the MODIS dataset, i.e., 500 m, which were then compared against in situ measurements from the REMEDHUS network in Spain. Results using two years of SMOS and MODIS data showed a similar performance for the four indices, with slightly better results when using the index derived from the first SWIR band. For the areal-average, a coefficient of correlation (R) of similar to 0.61 and similar to 0.72 for the morning and afternoon orbits, respectively, and a centered root mean square difference (cRMSD) of similar to 0.04 m(3) m(-3) for both orbits was obtained. A twofold improvement of the current versions of this downscaling approach has been achieved by using more frequent and higher spatial resolution water indexes as vegetation descriptors: (1) the spatial resolution of the resulting soil moisture maps can be enhanced from similar to 40 km up to 500 m, and (2) more accurate soil moisture maps (in terms of R and cRMSD) can be obtained, especially in periods of high vegetation activity. The results of this study support the use of high resolution LST and SWIR-based vegetation indices to disaggregate SMOS observations down to 500 m soil moisture maps, meeting the needs of fine-scale hydrological applications.

AB Knowledge of wetland systems from sub-humid and semi-arid regions remains poor, particularly with regards to surface water-groundwater interactions. As a result of variable inflow and high evapotranspiration rates, such systems are often associated with the development of groundwater salinity. By focusing on the riparian species, Acacia xanthophloea, this study investigates the interaction between vegetation, groundwater, and occurrence of salinity on the Mkuze River floodplain, a seasonally dry, freshwater wetland. The relationship between groundwater chemistry and water table elevation suggests that these deep-rooted trees act as evapotranspirational pumps, selectively removing water and causing the subsurface concentration of solutes. Extensive root systems that reach the water table, coupled with high transpiration rates, result in local groundwater reaching electrical conductivities in excess of 20 mS/cm, approximately 15-20 times higher than those commonly found elsewhere on the floodplain. In this environment, these trees appear tolerant of salinities that would be toxic to most other plants. Plant tissue ion concentrations indicate that solute exclusion is the dominant means for avoidance of salt toxicity, with root turnover a possible regulatory mechanism. Data presented support our hypothesis that these trees exert feedback interactions on groundwater and sediment chemistry. Transpiration results not only in the development of saline groundwater, which is likely to influence vegetation distribution, but also initiates the precipitation of less soluble minerals, such as CaCO3 and SiO2, which have the potential to modify sediment pH, hydraulic conductivity, and landscape topography. Spatial variation in chemical processing is thus likely to play a role in creating and maintaining habitat diversity on the floodplain.
   Wetlands in semi-arid and sub-humid regions are often susceptible to shallow groundwater chemical transformations due to seasonal or episodic inflows and higher evapotranspiration demand. The documentation of solute concentration and retention in wetland systems from a variety of semi-arid and sub-humid areas suggests that evapotranspiration-driven processes may be more widespread than is currently understood. In environments where evapotranspiration plays an important role in the overall water budget of a wetland, similar vegetation-groundwater interactions and chemical processes are likely to occur. Recognition of broad differences between such systems and those of their better studied counterparts in tropical and temperate regions makes it necessary to develop a greater understanding of these processes.

AB A long time record of drop size distributions (DSDs) is used to evaluate the effect of the DSD variability on the accuracy of radar adjustment by comparison with a rain gage on a daily basis. Radar and gage measurements are simulated from DSDs. When a single R-Z relationship is used in the adjustment of the radar as a hydrological instrument, a standard deviation of fractional error of similar to 28% is expected. This uncertainty is related to the DSD variability in time. A calibration of reflectivity can be done if a disdrometer is available. This disdrometric radar calibration is not affected by the DSD variability. Thus, the uncertainty that is expected in the radar adjustment with a gage is eliminated. Some uncertainty in radar-disdrometer comparison due to the difference in sampling volumes is minimized by applying a sequential intensity filtering technique (SIFT). Good correlations between radar and disdrometric reflectivities indicate that this could be an excellent way of calibrating radar on a daily basis when a disdrometer is located at close range (less than 30 km) from radar. Furthermore, the consistency of independent checks of radar calibration error with different disdrometers and polarimetry validates the argument that the radar-disdrometer comparison can be used as a tool. for absolute radar calibration.
   The information from the McGill operational S-band potarimetric radar is also used to calibrate radar. This method is based on the fact that the specific differential phase shift (K-DP) or differential phase shift (Phi(DP)) between the horizontal and vertical polarized beams is immune to the radar calibration error whereas the reflectivity is affected by the calibration error. Due to the variability of DSDs only, the uncertainty in polarimetric calibration is the standard deviation of 1 dB with a single parameter K-DP and reduces to 0.5 dB when the differential reflectivity (Z(DR)) is added as well. To guarantee the stability of this calibration method, data longer than at least an hour is necessary to calculate the calibration error for the fast scanning McGill operational polarimetric radar and contamination by bright band or snow should be avoided. The sensitivity of this calibration method with respect to the drop deformation is tested. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands, one of the largest biosphere carbon reservoirs, are facing climate change induced water-table draw -down and carbon loss. To provide insights into peatland protection and carbon-water cycle under the back-ground of global change, the detailed relationship between peatland ecology and water table depth (WTD) should be considered. In this study, we focused on carbon flux and synthesized datasets on WTD, carbon dynamics, vegetation and microbiologic activities in the Dajiuhu Peatland to better understand the ecological response to the hydrological variations. Based on modern monitoring, the daily CH4 emission decreased and CO2 emission increased with the fall of the WTD. When the WTD was deeper than 30 cm, daily carbon sequestration reduced until it approached 0 according to nonlinear models. By comparisons with previous spatial soil TOC, vegetation and microbiologic surveys, we proposed that approximately 30 cm is a critical WTD level (turning point or zone) affecting the structure and function of peatland ecosystems. Prolonged and severe droughts might trigger an ecological shift of peatland because increase in oxygen availability and decrease in water availability are not able to meet the physiological needs of living organisms, which further decreases CH4 emission due to limited methanogenesis and enhanced methanotrophy and weakens carbon sequestration through enhanced litter decomposition. This was also confirmed by palaeo-ecological records. In particular, precipitation-induced declines of WTD (WTD > 30 cm) during 9,500-9,200 cal yr BP, 6,000-4,000 cal yr BP and 3,600-3,200 cal yr BP caused a series of ecological changes, including the decreases in wet-preferred Sphagnum and herbs, enhanced aerobic bacteria activities and ecosystem respiration, and changed soil carbon sequestration. Drought during 6,000-4,000 cal yr BP induced low carbon sequestration. However, rapid vegetation succession and peat accumulation caused by the abrupt hydrological variations during 9,500-9,200 cal yr BP and 3,600-3,200 cal yr BP might have resulted in temporary increases in carbon sequestration. Our results demonstrate that WTD is crucial to the regulation of peatland ecological functions. This finding offers references for peatland carbon- -water cycles and management.

AB The continuous ecological restoration of the Loess Plateau, which aims to reduce the sediment entering into the Yellow River, is known throughout the world for two strategies: the integrated soil conservation project that began in the 1970s, and the "Grain for Green" project that began in the 1990s. However, the topic of whether the muddy water in the middle Yellow River run clearer remains debatable, and, in fact, response to the topic is reasonably well documented in regard to hydrological changes in the sediment source area. Six sub-catchments nested in the Beiluo River basin - one of the major sediment sources for the Yellow River - were selected, with data series ranging from 1957 to 2009. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used for trend detection. A simple method was developed based on the distribution of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) versus water discharge. Using this method, we evaluated the quantities of sediment yield reduction attributed to streamflow and SSC changes due to the two strategies. The results showed that annual sediment yield in 5 out of 6 stations significantly decreased, with rates varying from -4 to -217 t center dot km(-2)center dot yr(-1). Significant decreases in daily and event streamflow and suspended sediment concentration were identified, especially at a high SSC (top 1-5%). During the integrated soil conservation period, the sediment yield was reduced mainly by decreases in high flow and high SSC conditions. In contrast, during the "Grain for Green" period, sediment yield was reduced due to decreases in streamflow and SSC at all magnitudes. It was concluded that rainfall-sediment load dynamics have changed in the context of ecological restoration. Changes in both streamflow and the SSC-water discharge relationship induced the sediment yield reduction over time; in other words, the streamflow in the middle reaches of Yellow River became clearer during periods of ecological restoration. Moreover, the increased annual sediment yield at the Zhangcunyi station exposed a risk of increased erosion in areas where forests had been well preserved. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Input selection for data-driven rainfall-runoff models is an important task as these models find the relationship between rainfall and runoff by direct mapping of inputs to output. In this study, two different input selection methods were used: cross-correlation analysis (CCA), and a combination of mutual information and cross-correlation analyses (MICCA). Selected inputs were used to develop adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in Sungai Kayu Ara basin, Selangor, Malaysia. The study catchment has 10 rainfall stations and one discharge station located at the outlet of the catchment. A total of 24 rainfall-runoff events (10-min interval) from 1996 to 2004 were selected from which 18 events were used for training and the remaining 6 were reserved for validating (testing) the models. The results of ANFIS models then were compared against the ones obtained by conceptual model HEC-HMS. The CCA and MICCA methods selected the rainfall inputs only from 2 (stations 1 and 5) and 3 (stations 1, 3, and 5) rainfall stations, respectively. ANFIS model developed based on MICCA inputs (ANFIS-MICCA) performed slightly better than the one developed based on CCA inputs (ANFIS-CCA). ANFIS-CCA and ANFIS-MICCA were able to perform comparably to HEC-HMS model where rainfall data of all 10 stations had been used; however, in peak estimation, ANFIS-MICCA was the best model. The sensitivity analysis on HEC-HMS was conducted by recalibrating the model by using the same selected rainfall stations for ANFIS. It was concluded that HEC-HMS model performance deteriorates if the number of rainfall stations reduces. In general, ANFIS was found to be a reliable alternative for HEC-HMS in cases whereby not all rainfall stations are functioning. This study showed that the selected stations have received the highest total rain and rainfall intensity (stations 3 and 5). Moreover, the contributing rainfall stations selected by CCA and MICCA were found to be located near the outlet of contributing sub-catchments. This provides valuable information towards identifying the more contributing sub-catchments in catchments such as Sungai Kayu Ana where no flow measurement is available for sub-catchments.

AB Recent studies have shown the super saturation of fluvial networks with respect to carbon dioxide, and the concept that the high carbon dioxide is at least partially the result of turnover of sediment organic carbon that ranges in age from years to millennia. Currently, there is a need for more highly resolved studies at stream and river scales that enable estimates of terrestrial carbon turnover within fluvial networks. Our objective was to develop a new isotope-based metric to estimate the quality of sediment organic carbon delivered to temperate streams and to use the new metric to estimate carbon quality across landscape disturbance gradients. Carbon quality is defined to be consistent with in-stream turnover and our metric is used to measure the labile or recalcitrant nature of the terrestrial-derived carbon within streams. Our hypothesis was that intensively-disturbed landscapes would tend to produce low quality carbon because deep, recalcitrant soil carbon would be eroded and transported to the fluvial system while moderately disturbed or undisturbed landscapes would tend to produce higher quality carbon from well-developed surface soils and litter. The hypothesis was tested by applying the new carbon quality metric to 15 temperate streams with a wide range of landscape disturbance levels. We find that our hypothesis premised on an indirect relationship between the extent of landscape disturbance and the quality of sediment carbon in streams holds true for moderate and high disturbances but not for undisturbed forests. We explain the results based on the connectivity, or dis-connectivity, between terrestrial carbon sources and pathways for sediment transport. While pathways are typically un-limited for disturbed landscapes, the un-disturbed forests have dis-connectivity between labile carbon of the forest floor and the stream corridor. Only in the case when trees fell into the stream corridor due to severe ice storms did the quality of sediment carbon increase in the streams. We argue that as scientists continue to estimate the in-stream turnover of terrestrially-derived carbon in fluvial carbon budgets, the assumption of pathway connectivity between carbon sources to the stream should be justified.

   RESPONSES
AB Plants respond to environmental stimuli through changes in growth and development. Characteristics of wood cells such as the cross-sectional area of vessel elements (hereafter referred to as vessels) may store information about environmental factors present at the time of vessel differentiation. The analysis of vessel characteristics therefore offers a different time resolution than annual ring width because vessels in tree rings differentiate within days to a few weeks. Little research has been conducted on the sensitivity of earlywood vessels in ring-porous species in response to flooding. The general objectives of this study were to determine the plasticity of earlywood vessel to high flows and spring flooding in floodplain black ash (Fraxinus nigra Marsh.) trees and to assess the utility of developing continuous earlywood vessel chronologies in dendrohydrological reconstruction. In contrast, most dendrohydrological studies until now have mainly used vessel anomalies (flood rings) as discrete variables to identify exceptional flood events. The study area is located in the boreal region of northwestern Quebec. Vessel and ring-width chronologies were generated from F. nigra trees growing on the floodplain of Lake Duparquet. Spring discharge had among all hydro-climatic variables the strongest impact on vessel formation and this signal was coherent spatially and in the frequency domain. The mean vessel area chronology was significantly and negatively correlated to discharge and both the linearity and the strength of this association were unique. In floodplain F. nigra trees, spring flooding promoted the formation of more abundant but smaller earlywood vessels. Earlywood vessels chronologies were also significantly associated with other hydrological indicators like Lake Duparquet's ice break-up date and both ice-scar frequency and height chronologies. These significant relationships stress the utility of developing continuous vessels chronologies for hydrological reconstructions prior to instrumental data. Continuous earlywood vessel chronologies may also be useful in determining the impact of altered hydrological regime in floodplain habitat regulated by spring floods. Future research should involve quantifying the impact of high flows and flooding on other cell constituents and also determining the plasticity and utility of continuous anatomical series in floodplain diffuse-porous species.

AB Stream water and groundwater solute concentration are subject to a multitude of biogeochemical processes that act at different scales and are often characterized by non-linear relationships and feedback loops. Different multivariate statistical methods were applied to investigate the interplay of different processes. The data set from the Lehstenbach catchment. in South Germany comprised 2641 stream water and groundwater samples from 38 different sites in the catchment, where 13 different solutes had been determined. According to the correlation dimension analysis, the number of dominant processes was four. The first four components determined via principal component analysis comprised 88% of the total variance, whereas the non-linear isometric feature mapping explained 92% with the first four components. These components were ascribed to prevailing biogeochemical processes and were used to investigate spatial and temporal patterns. Redox processes and contamination by road salt explained 35% of the variance each. Another 13% were ascribed to near-surface runoff in the acidified topsoil, and 9% to the impact of contaminated fitter gravel in some of the groundwater wells.
   The redox component exhibited clear seasonal patterns at most stream water and groundwater sampling sites, with the most reduced conditions in late summer, immediately before the onset of re-wetting. There was clear evidence that redox processes, especially denitrification, play an important rote even in the oxic aquifer. During discharge peaks, stream water exhibited higher values of the near-surface runoff component. However, the associated lower values of the redox component pointed to near-surface runoff in the riparian wetlands as the predominating runoff generation process rather than to a contribution of upslope soil water. A series of major rain storms in fall 1998 altered groundwater and stream water solute concentration for months: stream water and groundwater became more oxic and more acidified, and showed a higher impact of road salt contamination at some sites.
   Overall, the spatial and temporal patterns of the predominating components gave a consistent picture and helped considerably to better understand the interplay between biogeochemical and hydrological processes. The chosen approach is a promising tool. for investigating apparently complex hydrological and biogeochemical systems. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB There is new pressure to develop some of Australia's dryland river basins for irrigation as development on highly regulated rivers has halted with increasing ecological degradation. Sparse populations, limited infrastructure, and minimal water resource development in Australian dryland river basins mean streamflow records are few and typically short in duration. The Paroo and Warrego basins (74,003 and 62,908 km(2), respectively; largely undeveloped) in the northwest of the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia, each have four streamflow gauges with more than 15 years of daily record, and four and eight years, respectively, of coincident record. These short records do not fully characterise the highly variable flow regimes. Improved characterisation of the flow regime and determination of the potential impacts of water resource development can be based on streamflow simulation using climate data. Numerous floodplain lakes and wetlands are important ecological assets in these basins. For these environments impacts will be a result of changes in the higher (above mean) flows, which can be reasonably assessed by changes in monthly streamflows. However, high spatial and temporal variability of runoff generation, and the delicate hydrologic balance (runoff is a small fraction of rainfall) in dryland regions means the relationship between rainfall and runoff is complex, and a daily time step model was therefore required to adequately simulate monthly streamflow. It was neither necessary, nor (because of limited data) possible to employ a complex spatially distributed model. Use of a highly parameterised, lumped-parameter conceptual model was also deemed unnecessarily complex, however, it was recognised that a simple black box model was unlikely to be successful. As a compromise, we implemented a simple conceptualisation of the daily water balance in PC spreadsheet software. The model was calibrated and validated using monthly streamflow volumes. The model accounts for 76-88% and 60-81% of the variance in monthly streamflows in the Paroo (four stations) and Warrego (three stations) basins, respectively. We use the model to explore the relative importance of local and catchment rainfall in flood generation, and to predict the timing and magnitude of large floods in these basins over the last 100 years.

AB Hans A. Einstein initiated a probabilistic approach to modelling sediment transport in rivers. His formulae were based on theory and were stimulated by laboratory investigations. The theory assumes that bed load movement occurs in individual steps of rolling, sliding or saltation and rest periods. So far very few attempts have been made to measure stochastic elements in nature. For the first time this paper presents results of radio-tracing the travel path of individual particles in a large braided gravel bed river: the Waimakariri River of New Zealand. As proposed by Einstein, it was found that rest periods can be modelled by an exponential distribution, but particle step lengths are better represented by a gamma distribution. Einstein assumed an average travel distance of 100 grain-diameters for any bed load particle between consecutive points of deposition, but larger values of 6.7 m or 150 grain-diameters and 6.1 m or 120 grain-diameters were measured for two test particle sizes. Together with other available large scale field data, a dependence of the mean step length on particle diameter relative to the D-50 Of the bed surface was found. During small floods the time used for movement represents only 2.7% of the total time from erosion to deposition. The increase in percentage of time being used for transport means that it then has to be regarded in stochastic transport models. Tracing the flow path of bed load particles between erosion and deposition sites is a step towards explaining the interactions between sediment transport and river morphology.

AB Changes in hydrological processes caused by rapid urbanization lead to the growing incidence of urban flooding, which is a major challenge to urban sustainability. Urban floods have seriously threatened the natural envi-ronment and human life. Understanding the spatial patterns and influencing factors of urban flooding has important implications for mitigating urban flood hazards. Previous studies have demonstrated the impact of natural and human factors on urban flooding, but a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of urban flooding requires appropriate scales and evidence from multiple cities. In this study, 1201 flood records from 2015 to 2020 in 9 megacities (including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shenyang) in China were used to investigate the spatial characteristics and driving factors of urban flooding. A combination of multiple stepwise regression and boosted regression tree (BRT) models was used to reveal the flood driving mechanism in megacities. The results indicated that flood events in 9 cities presented an aggregation effect, but the spatial characteristics and kernel density were different between coastal and inland cities. At all scales (1 km, 3 km, 5 km), physical geomorphic features (2D and 3D landscapes) have a high contribution to urban flooding, especially patch density, density of buildings and building shape coefficients. The relative contributions of the 2D and 3D landscape pattern factors increased by 43.8 % and 36.2 % as the grid scale increased from 1 km to 5 km, respectively. However, the relative contributions of topography, meteorology and drainage capacity factors decreased by 47.6 %, 39.0 % and 33.2 %, respectively. At a large scale (5 km), the correlation of driving factors for urban flooding was stronger, and the dominant factors were more obvious. At a small scale (1 km), the contribution of driving factors is relatively average. The scale effect significantly affects urban flooding. which suggests that an appropriate scale can more accurately capture the dominant drivers of urban flooding. Therefore, a novel method that integrates the stepwise regression model and BRT model were presented to quantify the complex relationship between urban flooding and driving factors under various analysis scales. The methods and results proposed by our study provided important insights and perspectives for urban flood risk mitigation and urban planning through multiscale analysis of flood driving mechanisms.

AB Headwater catchments provide substantial streamflow to rivers even during long periods of drought. Documenting the mean transit times (MTT) of stream water in headwater catchments and therefore the retention capacities of these catchments is crucial for water management. This study uses time series of H-3 activities in combination with major ion concentrations, stable isotope ratios and radon activities (Rn-222) in the Lyrebird Creek catchment in Victoria, Australia to provide a unique insight into the mean transit time distributions and flow systems of this small temperate headwater catchment. At all streamflows, the stream has H-3 activities (< 2.4 TU) that are significantly below those of rainfall (similar to 3.2 TU), implying that most of the water in the stream is derived from stores with long transit times. If the water in the catchment can be represented by a single store with a continuum of ages, mean transit times of the stream water range from similar to 6 up to 40 years, which indicates the large retention potential for this catchment. Alternatively, variations of H-3 activities, stable isotopes and major ions can be explained by mixing between of young recent recharge and older water stored in the catchment. While surface runoff is negligible, the variation in stable isotope ratios, major ion concentrations and radon activities during most of the year is minimal (+/- 12%) and only occurs during major storm events. This suggests that different subsurface water stores are activated during the storm events and that these cease to provide water to the stream within a few days or weeks after storm events. The stores comprise micro and macropore flow in the soils and saprolite as well as the boundary between the saprolite and the fractured bed rock. Hydrograph separations from three major storm events using Tritium, electrical conductivity and selected major ions as well a delta O-18 suggest a minimum of 50% baseflow at most flow conditions.
   We demonstrate that headwater catchments can have a significant storage capacity and that the relationship between long-water stores and fast storm event subsurface flow is complex. The study also illustrates that using H-3 to determine mean transit times is probably only valid for baseflow conditions where the catchment can be represented as a single store.
   The results of this study reinforce the need to protect headwater catchments from contamination and extreme land use changes.

AB Sediment has been released from the dams of many rivers throughout the world to keep reservoirs operational. This huge flux of sediment resulted in deposition in downstream channels and bars and was followed by an intensive colonization of plants. An investigation was carried out to clarify the relationship between the colonization of herbaceous vegetation and a set of edaphic factors observed in downstream active river channel areas of the Kurobe River in Japan that were subject to different rates of deposition. Herbaceous plant biomass was strongly correlated (p < 0.01) with surface sandy layer thickness. It had also a high correlation with a fraction of fine sediments (p < 0.01). However, higher plant biomass due to fine sediment was associated with its total nitrogen (TN) concentration rather than total phosphorus (TP) or moisture content levels. The TN:TP ratio of substrate was smaller than that of the plants and suggests that the lack of nitrogen (N) was the primary factor for limiting plant growth. Following sediment release. N was no longer a limiting factor and as a result, vegetation growth was promoted. The increased depth of fine sediment in these areas also favored vegetative encroachment. Over 90% of TN and TP in the substrate were organic and originated from the nutrients that were in the sediment accumulated in the reservoir. The accumulation of sediment also changed the inundation pattern of the river channels and frequently submerged transects that were more fertile and productive for herbaceous plants as opposed to less inundated, higher spots, which represent the original unaffected portion of the river. After initial colonization, the encroachment of vegetation was accelerated by the intensified accumulation of fine sediment during inundation and added nutrients through litter mineralization. The history of sediment release in the Kurobe River and the rate of encroachment of channel vegetation follow a similar trend. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the downstream river channel morphology and ecosystem shift considerably due to multiple dam releases and create a substantial amount of sediment deposition that favorably change the nutrient stoichiometry and allow for vegetative encroachment. Therefore, any nutrient release program should consider the measurable costs and benefits when it comes to these releases and the amount of vegetative growth in these channels that result.

AB Nitrogen source identification is critical to effectively govern nitrogen contamination, as excessive nitrogen content in groundwater has become a crucial global environmental problem. The traditional stable isotope approach (delta N-15-NO3-, delta O-18-NO3-, delta N-15-NF4+) has been widely used to identify nitrogen sources by comparing the isotopic signals between groundwater samples and the possible nitrogen source. However, nitrogen source apportionment based only on that method would be inaccurate because isotopic signals overlap between the nitrogen sources and nitrogen that has undergone biochemical reactions. To solve the shortcomings of the traditional stable isotope approach, the isotope ratios of N2O, the SP-delta O-18 model and the traditional stable isotope approach were combined to depict the nitrogen transformation processes and reconstruct the "initial" isotopic compositions of nitrogen sources. A total of 58 groundwater samples were collected in the Dongguan Basin and were analysed during June-July 2018. NO3--N was the dominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in most of the groundwater samples. In the groundwater flow direction, NO3- contents decreased, while the delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- values increased. The positive relationship between delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- and the calculation results of the SP-delta O-18 model indicated that both denitrification and nitrification processes occurred in the groundwater, and denitrification acted as the dominant nitrogen transformation process. The initial isotope ratio of nitrogen obtained from the combined use of the calculation results of the SP-delta O-18 model and delta N-15-NO3- (or delta N-15-NH4+) value suggested that manure and septic wastes were the primary sources of NO3- and NH4+ in the groundwater. The redox-sensitive components and the calculation results of the SP-delta O-18 model depicted the reductive level of NO(3)(-)in the groundwater flow direction: NO3- reduction did not occur in the upstream area, NO3- reduction was strong in the intermediate transition zone, and NO3- contents were completely consumed and CH4 occurred in the downstream region. This study demonstrated that the combination of the traditional stable isotope approach and the isotope ratios of N2O are useful tools for revealing the source and transformation of nitrogen in groundwater. The method used in this study provides new insight for nitrogen source identification.

AB Providing people with fresh water is one of the greatest challenges of the century. Since most of the world's liquid fresh water is groundwater, the knowledge of aquifer storage properties is essential. Moreover, there is a need to focus research on poor aquifers (i.e. capable of providing about 100 m(3)/day) which will play an increasing role for supplying many human communities. This paper concerns a study carried out in a clayey sandstones aquifer in Northern Cambodia.
   Conventional hydraulic methods used to characterize aquifers are costly, time-consuming and thus they are usually not used in most of the water projects in developing countries. Therefore, geophysical methods can be useful if they improve aquifer characterization. As compared to other non-invasive geophysical methods, magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) is selective to groundwater. MRS results are the distribution of both water content and pore-size related-parameters as a function of depth. However, relationships between the field scale MRS results and hydrogeological storage-related properties have not been well established yet. We present in this paper a comparison of MRS results with both specific yield calculated from pumping tests and effective porosity calculated from tracer tests. We found that the MRS water content is equal or higher than the specific yield and the effective porosity, thus indicating that MRS also measures capillary water in unsaturated zone and part of the bound groundwater attached to the aquifer solid matrix. We also found that the MRS pore-size parameter is linearly correlated with both the effective porosity and the specific yield, thus suggesting that the hydrogeological storage properties are mainly controlled by the size of the pores of the aquifer. Consequently, we adapted an approach used in the oil industry for differencing gravitational water from capillary water and from bound water, based on the MRS pore-size parameter. In the clayey sandstones of Cambodia, our approach named MRS apparent cutoff time approach, allowed calculating specific yield with an average error of 23% (which is far less than the previous published results), and for the first time it allowed calculating effective porosity (with an average error of 11%). We conclude that the MRS apparent cutoff time approach is useful for estimating aquifer storage properties down to 50-80 m deep, in a single day and at an affordable cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB National development and resilience are strained by shifting regional water storage patterns. The water shifting pattern has been found over China, but the underlying climate mechanisms of the pattern remain largely unexplored. In this study, how shifting regional moisture conditions are related to intra-annual and inter-annual atmospheric oscillations can be explored by terrestrial water storage (TWS) derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Using a principal component analysis (PCA), the TWSs over the East China were divided into two spatial empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), accounting for more than 70% of the total spatial variance. The first TWS EOF is related to the seasonal variation, whereas the second TWS EOF is associated with the spatial distribution of TWS trend. In addition, the PCA trend results for precipitation and actual evapotranspiration (ET) are consistent with TWS, with a correlation of 0.44 (p << 0.05) and -0.47 (p << 0.05), respectively. Based on these PCA results, the Yangtze River Basin (YARB) was wetting, while the North China Plain (NCP) was drying between 2003 and 2015. This unbalance water distribution pattern was potentially linked to regional changes of the Hadley-type meridional circulation which aggravated the unevenness between north and south water distributions over the East China. Furthermore, a wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis was used for investigating multi-scale relationships between TWS and different climate factors. The local wind intensity and Asian monsoons were related to the regional unbalance TWS pattern on an intra-annual scale, with significance correlations of -0.49 (at p << 0.05) and 0.9 (at p << 0.05) respectively. Meanwhile El Nino Southern Oscillations (ENSO) was significantly negatively linked (correlation of -0.41, p << 0.05) with TWS variability at the inter-annual scale. However, based on partial WTC results, the association between ENSO and TWS can be explained away by the Asian monsoons, so that ENSO is only indirectly related to TWS through monsoons. Overall, the approaches and results of this study not only explained that the shifting TWS distribution over the East China was related to varying strength of local wind intensity and Asian monsoons, and ENSO at intra-annual and inter-annual scales respectively, but also provided a framework for studying TWS redistribution over other regions, which are crucial for sustainable regional development and resilient water future.

AB Dynamics in long-term evapotranspiration (ET) and its controlling variables are essential for understanding how a high-altitude wetlands ecosystem responds to climate change. The rising temperature is expected to agitate the regional hydrological cycle and water balance, particularly in the subalpine wetland valley of Jiuzhaigou, located in the transition zone between the northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Sichuan Basin, Southwest China. Here, we used growing season multi-year (2013-2021) Bowen ratio data to assess the variability in ET and its key controlling parameters at different timescales in Jiuzhaigou valley. This study also explored the ratio of ET to precipitation (P). The wetland daily mean ET varied from 0.06 to 6.77 mm d-1, with a mean value of 2.64 mm d-1 for the nine years. Fluctuations in daily ET were primarily driven by available energy (net radiation, Rn), explaining 86 % of the variation. Seasonal patterns in ET were largely similar to environmental parameters, i.e., Rn, air temperature (Ta), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), peaking in August with an interannual monthly mean value of 3.48 mm d-1. Interannual monthly mean ET had a strong positive linear relationship with Rn, Ta, and VPD, while there was no significant correlation with P on a growing season basis. Furthermore, monthly ET was shown to be regulated by Ta largely in high-temperature months and minimally in low-temperature months. The growing season ET varied interannually, and the ET to P ratio (i.e., ET/P) ranged between 0.52 and 1.16. Interannual variation in annual ET was controlled by Ta and P, which individually explained 73 and 61 % of the variation, respectively. The multiple regression model indicated that Ta and P together elucidated 92 % of the variation in annual ET. The increased sensitivity (e.g., regression slopes) of ET to P over 2014-2021 indicates that ET consumed most of P, which leads to decreasing runoff and streams drying up. This study clarifies the temporal dynamics in ET for wetlands and its environmental controls at multiple timescales. It is demonstrated that the proportion of ET could increase in response to increasing temperature without an associated increase in P, affecting local water balance. These results could potentially contribute to sustainable water management in high-altitude wetlands and environmental planning under future climate change.

AB Spatial downscaling has recently become a crucial process in the regional application of coarse-resolution passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) products. Extensive gaps in auxiliary optical/thermal infrared observation data (mainly caused by cloud cover) and gaps in coarse-resolution passive microwave SSM data lead to spatiotemporal discontinuity in downscaled SSM maps, thereby limiting their applications. An improved downscaling method for the 25-km European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SSM product was proposed to obtain daily seamless downscaled SSM series at a 1-km scale. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra daily land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products were used as auxiliary data for the downscaling process. Prior to the spatial downscaling, an annual temperature cycle model was applied to the 1-km daily daytime LST data to fill the data gaps caused by cloud cover and to derive the spatial-seamless LST (gap-filled). Subsequently, the gap-filled ESA CCI SSM was generated at the original resolution based on the relationships among the SSM, LST, and NDVI. Finally, these were utilized to obtain a seamless downscaled series SSM at 1-km spatial resolution with a value-consistent downscaling method. The proposed method was applied to data obtained for the Iberian Peninsula from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. Based on the comparison with the precipitation dataset, the downscaled SSM exhibited strong temporal correlation with rainfall events. Evaluation using the in situ SSM from the REMEDHUS network highlighted the good performance of the downscaled SSM at network level with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.820. The root-mean-square-error, unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE), and bias were 0.091, 0.033, and 0.085 m(3)/m(3), respectively. A comparison with an alternative downscaled SSM product produced by the Barcelona Expert Center, one of the soil moisture and ocean salinity mission (SMOS)-downscaled SSM datasets, also indicated that the downscaled SSM has better spatiotemporal coverage and performance in terms of R and ubRMSE with reference to the REMEDHUS network. These results confirmed that the proposed method is an efficient and convenient downscaling process that can be used to generate high-resolution SSM data without spatiotemporal gaps. The downscaled SSM data improves the accuracy of the original passive microwave SSM product in describing regional SSM variations and shows good potential for related applications at regional scale.

AB Groundwater is an important resource, not least in south-eastern areas of England, where chalk is the dominant aquifer. Such chalk-fed stream ecosystems are rich and highly productive, they have particularly important springhead wetlands, and are characterised by fast-growing trout populations. The legislative framework, founded on the Minimum Acceptable Flow concept, is in place to protect these stream ecosystems. In surface water dominated catchments, normal operational rules use prescribed (usually hands-off) flows to protect in-river needs. Such rules are inappropriate for most groundwater-dominated catchments because of the slow response between change in groundwater abstraction and river flow. This paper illustrates the use of an Ecologically Acceptable Flow Regime (i) to determine a MAF based on the annual volume of flow, described as a how duration curve, to protect the riverine ecosystem at the catchment scale, and (ii) to set a prescribed flow that must be maintained locally by river support.

AB Soil moisture is a core ecohydrological element in the middle-high latitude frozen area, which occupies approximately 30% of the global land area. The Sanjiang Plain, an important commercial grain production area, is the largest swampy low plain in a middle-high latitude frozen area in China. However, no published studies on this region have clarified the accuracy of soil moisture data from in-situ measurements; the performance of ecohydrological models are also unknown. In this study, we compared the ability of the SMAP product, a RSDTVGM model, and two self-erected soil moisture monitoring stations to capture soil moisture information in the Sanjiang Plain by using the Triple Collocation method. Soil moisture data were collected for 642 continuous days, and the data period was divided into three frozen periods (FT) and two non-frozen (NFT) periods. Valid data supply rates of the three methods were also calculated and compared. From the Triple Collocation method, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SMAP, model and in-situ monitoring data sets were 0.03, 0.08, and 0.05. The valid data supply rates of the SMAP product in the FT and NFT periods were 27.1% and 57.5%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the SMAP product and the in-situ monitoring dataset was 0.301 for the FT period and 0.557 for the NFT period. The RS-DTVGM model had a data supply rate of 100%. The Pearson correlation coefficient for this model was 0.101 for the FT period, but reached 0.726 for the NFT period. For the three soil moisture data sets, the accuracy ranking in this middle-high latitude area was SMAP > in-situ monitoring > model simulation. Although neither SMAP nor the RS-DTVGM model could capture the real soil moisture information for the FT period, both could accurately simulate the soil moisture in the NFT period. The results from the RS-DTVGM model demonstrated a closer relationship with in-situ soil moisture measurement data relative to the SMAP method. The in-situ method provided accurate soil moisture data, but its application is limited by high cost. In the future, the data from the three methods should be assimilated together to measure soil moisture data with high accuracy and high spatial and temporal resolution in this important area.

AB Intertidal environments, including bare mudflats, tidal creeks, and vegetated salt marshes, are of significant physical and ecological importance in estuaries. Their morphodynamics are closely linked by mudflats and creek networks. Understanding water motion and sediment transport in mudflats and tidal creeks is fundamental to understand intertidal morphodynamics in intertidal environments. To explore dynamic interactions between tidal creeks and mudflats, we conducted field campaigns monitoring water depths, tidal currents, waves, suspended sediments, and bed-level changes at sites in both mudflats and tidal creeks in the Eastern Chongming tidal wetland in the Yangtze Delta for a full spring-neap tidal cycle. We saw that under fair weather conditions, the bed-level changes of the tidal creek site displayed a contrary trend compared with those of the mudflat site, indicating the source-sink relationship between tidal creek and mudflat. During over-marsh tides, the tidal creek site with relatively high bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.37 N/m(2)) was eroded by 35 mm whereas the mudflat site was accreted by 29 mm under low bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.18 N/m(2)). To the contrast, during creek-restricted tides, deposition occurred in the tidal creek site by 20 mm under low bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.09 N/m(2)) whereas erosion occurred in the mudflat site by 25 mm under relatively high bed shear stresses (averagely, 0.21 N/m(2)). Over a spring-neap tidal cycle, the net bed level changes were -15 mm (erosion) and 4 mm (deposition) in tidal creeks and mudflats, respectively. These results suggested that there were alternated erosion-deposition patterns in spring and neap tides, and a sediment source and sink shift between mudflats and creeks. We found that the eroded sediments in mudflats were transported landward into tidal creeks and deposited therein in neap tides, and these newly deposited sediments would be resuspended and transported to surrounding marshes (over-marsh deposition) at spring tides. The coherent sediment transport and associated erosion-deposition pattern within the mudflat-creek system at spring-neap tidal time scales thus played a fundamental role in intertidal morphodynamic development. These findings suggest that management and restoration of intertidal ecosystem need to take the entire mudflat-creek-marsh system as a unit into consideration rather than focusing on single elements.

AB Rainfall-runoff models are generally calibrated by using continuous stream discharge data. However, most catchments around the globe remain ungauged due to the difficulty in installing gauges in river channels with complex morphology and due to the high costs of installation and maintenance. Recently, new calibration methods that use water level data instead of gauged discharge to calibrate rainfall-runoff models have been proposed. With emerging low-cost local water-level monitoring technologies or with satellite altimetry, these water-level based calibration methods have the potential to significantly extend runoff prediction capability. However, rainfall-runoff models calibrated from using water-level information alone may lead to biased discharge even when water-level variations are accurately reproduced. It has been shown that this bias problem can be significantly alleviated when just a few discharge measurements, especially of high flows, are available and incorporated into the model calibration. However, it is rare to have discharge measurement data when catchments are ungauged. In this study, we incorporate discharge estimates derived from regionalization into a water-level based calibration using an inverse rating curve (IRC) method. Specifically, discharge indices such as the 95th percentile of daily discharge (Q95) and the mean daily discharge (Qmean) are estimated from catchment and climate characteristics based on regionalized relationships. These estimated discharge indices are then used to constrain the IRC calibration. We evaluate both constrained and unconstrained IRC methods over 130 study catchments where observed discharge time series are available but used only for validation in this study. Modelled discharge time series from the constrained IRC methods have median Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.61-0.63, compared with 0.54 from the unconstrained IRC method. Improvement is seen in around 75% of the catchments, with more than 0.2 increase in NSE values in 25% of the catchments. Improvement in the modelled discharges from using regionalized discharge indices is comparable to using observed discharge indices. Using regionalized Qmean yields greater improvement than using regionalized Q95. The constrained IRC methods tend to perform better in wetter catchments than in drier ones. This method can significantly extend rainfall-runoff model calibration in a wider range of catchments, including real ungauged catchments.

AB Projection of drought under a changing climate is important for drought risk assessment. Changes in precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (ETp) are expected to influence future drought occurrence. Thus, it is important to include both factors to accurately quantify change in drought frequency under future climate scenarios. Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is a widely used index in drought assessment because it considers the influence of both P and ETp on drought. Thus, in this study we used SPEI to quantify change in drought frequency under two different emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in the wheat belt of southeastern Australia with climatic data downscaled from 34 global climate models (GCMs). We also investigated whether differences ETp models would make a difference on drought projection. Therefore, we employed five different traditional ETp models (Penman, Jensen-Haise, Makkink, Abtew, Hargreaves) and three random forest (RF)-based models to calculate SPEI in this study. Results showed that drought, especially moderate and severe drought, would occur more frequently under future climate scenarios and the increased frequency was generally greater in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. Severe drought occurring in spring would increase by 3.1%-21.7% under RCP4.5 and 5.2%-41.0% under RCP8.5. In autumn, the likely mean increase of severe drought frequency was 0.7%-13.0% under RCP4.5 and 2.7%-27.9% under RCP8.5. Differences in the projected increase of drought frequency were found among the different ETp models. In general, RF-based ETp models, which projected larger increases in ETp, generally also projected larger increases in drought occurrence. A multilinear regression relationship was built between changes in drought frequency and changes in ETp and P. The regression showed that the increased drought frequency was a combined result of the increasing ETp and decreasing P, and that the increasing ETp might be the more dominant factor. The contribution of GCMs, RCPs, different ETp models, and their interaction to the uncertainty in drought projection was quantified with the use of analysis of variance. Results showed that GCMs and their interaction with RCPs were the dominant factors influencing uncertainty in drought projection.

AB The evolution of the channel thalweg and pool-riffle sequences is a critical feature of morphological adjustments in fluvial systems and might have important effects on aquatic habitat quality, channel stability and navigation. Based on the 220 cross-sectional profiles from 2002 to 2016, residual depths and spatial statistical analyses were used to quantitatively analyse the vertical variations and longitudinal distribution of the pool-riffle sequences and channel thalweg in the Yichang-Chenglingji Reach (YCR) of the Middle Yangtze River, which consists of the Yizhi-Zhijiang, Shashi-Gongan and Shishou-Jianli sub-reaches. The results showed that the dramatic reduction in the sediment loads following the construction of the Three Gorges Darn (TGD) has caused significant adjustments in the size, morphological diversity and spatial distribution of pool-riffle structures in the YCR. The average depth of the pools in the Yizhi-Zhijiang Reach and the Shishou-Jianli Reach overall exhibited a nonlinear growth trend, with the average residual depth increasing by 1.4 m and 1.9 m, respectively. However, the average residual depth in the Shashi-Gongan Reach showed a decreasing trend, with a reduction of approximately 1.2 m. The longitudinal lengths of the riffles in all three reaches contracted to different degrees, and the specific percentage of longitudinal river length occupied by riffles (total riffle length/total sub-reach length) decreased by 8%, 9.6% and 5.9% in the three sub-reaches from upstream to the downstream. In addition, the morphological diversity of the thalweg elevation in the Shashi-Gongan Reach and Shishou-Jianli Reach weakened after the construction of the TGD, while the bed topography in the Yizhi-Zhijiang Reach became more complex and diverse. Moreover, the pool-riffle structures in the YCR were rearranged and distributed regularly following the initiation of the TGD operation, although the variation characteristics of the average pool spacing in the three sub-reaches were quite different. Quantitative relationship between the average residual depth and the previous four-year hydrological condition was proposed for the three sub-reaches based on the Delayed Response Model (DRM) and verified using the measurements from 2013 to 2016.

AB Influential data are those that have a disproportionate impact on model performance, parameters and/or predictions. This paper evaluates two classes of diagnostics that identify influential data for hydrological model calibration: (1) numerical "case-deletion" diagnostics, which directly measure the influence of each data point on the calibrated model; and (2) analytical diagnostics based on Cook's distance, which combine information on the model residuals with a measure of the distance of each input point from the centre of the range of the input data (i.e., the leverage). Case-deletion methods rank influence by changes in the model parameters (measured through the Mahalanobis distance), performance (using objective function displacement) and predictions (e.g. mean and maximum streamflow). For the analytical methods, both linear and nonlinear estimates of leverage are used to calculate Cook's distance, which is used to rank influential data. We apply these diagnostics to three case studies and show that a single point could change mean/maximum streamflow predictions by 7%/9% for a rating curve model, and 13%/25%, for a hydrological model (GR4J) in an ephemeral catchment. In contrast, the influence was far less for GR4J in a humid catchment (0.2%/2.3%). Assuming the data are of high quality this indicates deficiencies in the ability of the GR4J model structure to reproduce the flow regime in the ephemeral catchment. The linear Cook's distance-based metric produced reasonably similar rankings to the case-deletion metrics at a fraction of the computational cost (300-1000 times faster), but with less flexibility to rank influence using specific aspects of model behaviour. The nonlinear distance produced rankings that were virtually the same as the case-deletion metrics for all case studies - this highlights the importance of its use for nonlinear hydrological models. Visual assessment was not a reliable method of influence analysis as there was no direct relationship between the most influential data and the highest observed streamflows. The findings establish the feasibility and importance of including influence detection diagnostics as a standard tool in hydrological model calibration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB dinal ranges are experiencing rising air temperatures compared to their surrounding rural areas. This study investigated how this urban heat island effect (UHIE) may influence the streamflow of rivers crossing large urban areas on annual and multi-decadal time-scales. In order to detect, link, and quantify differences in meteorological and streamflow patterns between rural and large urban areas, this study developed a methodology based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), cross-wavelet transform (XWT), linear regression, as well as the Mann-Kendall (MK) test. A case study was carried out for the city of Ottawa, Canada as the metropolitan centre, along with three surrounding rural locations (Angers, Arnprior, Russell), with pristine rivers crossing these locations. From roughly 1970 to 2000, air temperature in Ottawa increased at a rate exceeding 0.035 degrees C/year, while parallel changes in rural areas were relatively stable, and varied by less than 0.025 degrees C/year. The urban warming that occurred during these decades was accompanied by a significant drop in the amplitude of annual temperatures (i.e. warmer winters). Precipitation in both urban and rural areas showed no significant trends, although the variability in the precipitation amount decreased in both settings. Concurrently, streamflow showed decreasing trends in both urban and rural areas. Annual amplitudes in urban streamflow (Rideau River through Ottawa, ON) correlated positively with annual air temperature amplitudes (i.e., less severe annual flooding with a decreasing winter/summer temperature contrast), whereas such a relationship was not apparent for the rural stations. Moreover, the timing of the annual daily minimum temperature cycle correlated significantly with the streamflow pattern in the urban area, i.e., early annual warming corresponded to earlier annual streamflow maxima. The precipitation pattern (i.e. distribution of rain and snowfall over time) significantly influenced the annual and long term streamflow pattern, but this influence differed little between urban and rural areas. It was also determined that the warming from the urban heat island effect, especially during winter months, was found to perhaps reduce the severity of the annual spring flood event in mid-to-high latitudinal continental settings.

AB The main objectives of the research described in this paper are to assess the influence of atmospheric correction and the number of sampling points on the accuracy of lake water clarity using remote sensing. For this purpose field experiments were carried out at Bung Boraphet - the largest fresh water lake in Central Thailand. Two clarity parameters, secchi disk transparency (SDT), at 80 locations for three events on April 15th 2008 and March 24th and 31st 2009, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) for the last two events were collected. These field data were collected nearly contemporaneous or contemporaneous to three Landsat 5 TM images, which were acquired on April 13th 2008 and March 24th and 31st 2009, respectively. Digital numbers of the Thematic Mapper (TM) image bands were transformed to at-sensor radiance by a radiometric correction process and then atmospheric correction was made using the Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) code to acquire the surface reflectance. Linear regression equations between the log-transformed of clarity parameters and surface reflectance of each band and their band ratios at the same pixels were then determined. The band combinations TM1/TM3 and TM1 to estimate In(SDT), and TM3/TM1 and TM1 to determine In(SSC) for all satellite images were selected. These equations were later used to estimate the SOT and SSC values distributed across the whole lake. The results showed that lake wide average values of SDT for the three images are approximately 37, 97 and 81 cm, respectively, while the values of SSC for the second and third images are around 11 and 13 mg/l, respectively. The application of atmospheric correction to the TM data has proved to have the effect on the average values of SOT and SSC, and especially on their maximum and minimum values. Finally, it is possible to reduce the ground observation data of SDT and SSC substantially and still obtain reliable empirical relationships for the estimation of lake wide SOT and SSC values from TM data within the lake.

AB Castellvi et al. [2002] proposed a new approach for estimating sensible heat flux that combined surface renewal analysis and similarity theory. The approach used a calibration parameter ( here referred as beta) which was introduced by scaling the mean local gradient of air temperature with the ramp amplitude of air temperature over the mean volume of air parcel renewed per unit ground area, traditionally denoted as (alphaz), with z as the measurement height. Parameter b is explained and determined for half-hourly samples. It is shown that (kbeta) similar to 0.1 is appropriate under unstable conditions over a variety of canopies, with k as the von Karman constant. This value is rather robust with regard to height and when measuring in both the roughness and inertial sublayers. This understanding of parameter beta allowed a better understanding of parameter alpha and permitted the derivation of a modified approach for estimating sensible heat flux. In practice, it was possible to consider the new approach exempt from calibration. It was attractive for field applications and showed excellent performance under both stable and unstable conditions. A test was carried out for canopies where fetch requirements and full surface cover were not adequate. It was also shown that the flux variance method required calibration and did not perform as well as the proposed approach under such field conditions.

AB Two conceptual storage-based approaches have been developed for incorporating floodplain inundation modelling capability in two water resources planning models. Approach one is a simple method suitable for data limited environment, in which, flow in a river reach within a floodplain is partitioned into two components, in-stream and overbank flow, based on the in-stream capacity. A flood volume-area relationship derived from the flood inundation time series, which is generated by analysing daily MODIS imagery, is used to estimate flooded area for the overbank flow. The losses due to evaporation and groundwater seepage from floodplain are calculated using the estimated flooded area. This approach was implemented in the floodplain area of the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia. The simulated flow was compared with gauged data in 216 stations. The model has produced daily time series of floodplain stores and fluxes. The mass-balance analysis shows that the long term mass balance error was negligible for all floodplain reaches.
   Approach two is more comprehensive and suitable for areas with high resolution topography data. LiDAR data is used to divide a floodplain into multiple storages based on pre-defined threshold of floodplain inundation heights. The storage characteristics including disconnected storage volume (or, dead storage) and hydraulic connectivity between floodplain storages and a river reach are derived from the LiDAR data using a spatial data processing technique. This information is used to estimate floodplain inundation area for overbank flow. Approach 2 successfully simulated inundation depths, duration and extents in two reaches of Murrumbidgee floodplain. The performance of Approach 2 is highly satisfactory in terms of flood extent, depth and duration at a very high spatial resolution.
   The key limitations of Approach one are that this approach is unable to produce the spatial variability of floodplain inundation depth and extent and it does not incorporate dead storage. These limitations can be overcome by integrating it with Approach two. A key advantage of Approach two is the quick run time compared to a two dimensional hydrodynamic model. This makes the approach highly suitable to be incorporated in river system models for various scenario analyses for planning and management, which requires the model to run for over 100 years at a daily time step. The limitations of this approach are the requirement of very high resolution topographic data and the inability to produce flood velocity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite advancements in developing physics-based formulations to estimate the sheet-flow travel time (t(SHF)), the quantification of the relative impacts of influential parameters on t(SHF) has not previously been considered. In this study, a brief review of the physics-based formulations to estimate t(SHF) including kinematic wave (K-W) theory in combination with Manning's roughness (K-M) and with Darcy-Weisbach friction formula (K-D) over single and multiple planes is provided. Then, the relative significance of input parameters to the developed approaches is quantified by a density-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The performance of K-M considering zero-upstream and uniform flow depth (so-called K-M1 and K-M2), and K-D formulae to estimate the t(SHF) over single plane surface were assessed using several sets of experimental data collected from the previous studies. The compatibility of the developed models to estimate t(SHF) over multiple planes considering temporal rainfall distributions of Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS (I, Ia, II, and III) are scrutinized by several real-world examples. The results obtained demonstrated that the main controlling parameters of t(SHF) through K-D and K-M formulae are the length of surface plane (mean sensitivity index (T) over cap (i) = 0.72) and flow resistance (mean (T) over cap (i) = 0.52), respectively. Conversely, the flow temperature and initial abstraction ratio of rainfall have the lowest influence on t(SHF) (mean (T) over cap (i) is 0.11 and 0.12, respectively). The significant role of the flow regime on the estimation of t(SHF) over a single and a cascade of planes are also demonstrated. Results reveal that the K-D formulation provides more precise t(SHF) over the single plane surface with an average percentage of error, APE equal to 9.23% (the APE for K-M1 and K-M2 formulae were 13.8%, and 36.33%, respectively). The superiority of Manning-jointed formulae in estimation of t(SHF) is due to the incorporation of effects from different flow regimes as flow moves downgradient that is affected by one or more factors including high excess rainfall intensities, low flow resistance, high degrees of imperviousness, long surfaces, steep slope, and domination of rainfall distribution as NRCS Type I, II, or III.

AB Downscaling Global Climate Model (GCM) projections of future climate is critical for impact studies. Downscaling enables use of GCM experiments for regional scale impact studies by generating regionally specific forecasts connecting global scale predictions and regional scale dynamics. We employed the Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) to downscale 21st century precipitation for two data-sparse hydrologically challenging river basins in South Asia-the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. We used CGCM3.1 by Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and Analysis version 3.1 predictors in downscaling the precipitation. Downscaling was performed on the basis of established relationships between historical Global Summary of Day observed precipitation records from 43 stations and National Center for Environmental Prediction re-analysis large scale atmospheric predictors. Although the selection of predictors was challenging during the set-up of SDSM, they were found to be indicative of important physical forcings in the basins. The precipitation of both basins was largely influenced by geopotential height: the Ganges precipitation was modulated by the U component of the wind and specific humidity at 500 and 1000 h Pa pressure levels; whereas, the Brahmaputra precipitation was modulated by the V component of the wind at 850 and 1000 h Pa pressure levels. The evaluation of the SDSM performance indicated that model accuracy for reproducing precipitation at the monthly scale was acceptable, but at the daily scale the model inadequately simulated some daily extreme precipitation events. Therefore, while the downscaled precipitation may not be the suitable input to analyze future extreme flooding or drought events, it could be adequate for analysis of future freshwater availability. Analysis of the CGCM3.1 downscaled precipitation projection with respect to observed precipitation reveals that the precipitation regime in each basin may be significantly impacted by climate change. Precipitation during and after the monsoon is likely to increase in both basins under the A1B and A2 emission scenarios; whereas, the pre-monsoon precipitation is likely to decrease. Peak monsoon precipitation is likely to shift from July to August, and may impact the livelihoods of large rural populations linked to subsistence agriculture in the basins. Uncertainty analysis of the downscaled precipitation indicated that the uncertainty in the downscaled precipitation was less than the uncertainty in the original CGCM3.1 precipitation; hence, the CGCM3.1 downscaled precipitation was a better input for the regional hydrological impact studies. However, downscaled precipitation from multiple GCMs is suggested for comprehensive impact studies. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Land-use and forest cover change play important roles in socio-economic processes and have been linked with water supply and other ecosystem services in various regions of the world. Water yield from watersheds is a major ecosystem service for human activities but has been dramatically altered by landscape management superimposed on climatic variability and change. Many studies from different regions of the world have documented that in small watersheds (<100 ha) fast-growing forest plantations reduce water yield. Nevertheless, these effects have not been adequately documented in large watersheds >10,000 ha. In this paper, we examine the temporal variation of the residuals between best-fit precipitation-runoff relationships and instrumental streamflow records for two large watersheds (Purapel en Nirivilo, PNN and Cauquenes en el Arrayan, CQA) located in the Mediterranean-climate coastal range of South-Central Chile. In these watersheds, high resolution satellite imagery shows a decline in native forest cover from 52.3% to 14.2% for PPN and 36.1% to 8.1% in CQA, between 1975 and 2000. Conversely, in the same period the percentage area covered by forest plantations, mainly Pinus radiata, increased from 12% to 55% in PPN, and 4.7% to 42% in CQA. We observed a decreasing trend in summer runoff residuals regressed against annual precipitation in the same period, with slopes significantly different from zero for PPN (p = 0.035) and CQA (p = 0.008). We interpreted this pattern as an evidence of change in the hydrological regime in these watersheds as a consequence of forest cover and land-use changes. From a reanalysis of the observed data we estimate a decrease in runoff from 13.1 to 7.5 mm/summer for PPN and from 7.3 to 5 mm/summer for CQA, refer to the period 1991-2000 compared to 1981-1990. Multiple regression analyses of annual and seasonal flows show that besides precipitation, percentage-cover of forest plantations is a statistically significant predictor of summer flow with a partial negative correlation of -0.45 and -0.44 for PPN and CQA, respectively, p < 0.05. This study clearly shows the important effect that land-use change can have on water yield and to our knowledge this is the first study documenting the decrease in summer runoff in a landscape where native forest cover has dramatically declined and forest exotic plantations have expanded. Similar methods could be used elsewhere to inform policy and decision-making regarding forest and land-use planning. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lake Taihu is a typical shallow lake which frequently happens sediment resuspension induced by wind-induced waves. The experiments are carried on to simulate the wave disturbance processes in wave flume by setting a series of wave periods (1.2 s, 1.5 s, 1.8 s) and wave heights (2 cm, 10 cm). It aims to analyze the characteristics of sediment resuspension and the mechanisms of nutrients release and to evaluate the effects of sediment dredging on sediment resuspension and nutrients release in Lake Taihu. The results show that wave shear stress during 2 cm and 10 cm wave height processes ranges 0.018-0.023 N/m(2) and 0.221-0.307 N/m(2), respectively. Wave shear stress has no significant differences between wave periods. Wave height has much more effects on sediment resuspension. Wave height of 2 cm could induce total suspended solids (TSS) reaching up to 5.21 g/m(2) and resuspension flux of sediment (M) up to 1.74 g/m(2). TSS sharply increases to 30.33-52.41 g/m(2) and M reached up to 48.94 g/m(2) when wave height reaches to 10 cm. The disturbance depth under different sediment bulk weights ranges from 0.089 to 0.161 mm. Variation of suspended solids in 3 layers (1 cm, 5 cm, 20 cm above sediment interface) has no significant differences. Organic matter, TN and TP have positive relationship with SS. Organic matter is only accounted for 5.7%-7.3% of SS. The experiments under different sediment bulk densities (1.34 g/cm(3), 1.47 g/cm(3) and 1.59 g/cm(3)) find that TSS and M fall by 44.2% and 39.8% with sediment bulk density increasing, respectively. Total TN, DTN, TP and DTP decrease by 24.3%-33.6%. It indicates that sediment dredging could effectively reduce SS concentration and nutrient levels in water column. The researches provide a theoretical basis for sediment dredging to control the shore zone of Lake Taihu for lake management.

AB The Yarra River flows through the city of Melbourne in southeast Australia. The estuary of the river is in the centre of the city, and so is an area of recreational activities with strict water quality requirements to limit human health risks. These requirements are based on ensuring that the measured E. colt concentrations are below certain values. The objectives of the work presented in this paper were (i) to identify possible patterns in spatial and temporal variability of E. colt concentrations along the Yarra River, (ii) to understand the relationship between E. colt concentrations and other pollutants along the Yarra River, and (iii) to quantify the importance of stormwater drains in determining the magnitude of E. colt levels in the estuary. Two long-term water quality data sets, including E. colt concentrations, along the estuary were analysed: one data set comprises approximately monthly data collected in the period 1994-2010 at six sites, and the other is composed by weekly samples in 12 sites collected in 2005-2010. Additionally, data from two major stormwater drains were analysed. Median values of E. coli concentrations were observed to increase further downstream with concentrations showing larger variability in the estuary. Inter-annual and seasonal patterns were evident in the upper catchment, although differences were sometimes not statistically significant; in the more urbanised part of the catchment, including the estuary, inter-annual and seasonal variations were no longer present. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that the E. colt concentrations along the river were positively correlated with phosphorus. Estimates of loads from the streams and some of the drains supplying the estuary suggest that stormwater drains might be a considerable source of E. colt contamination especially during wet-weather flow; however, the loads from the drains appear to be at least one order of magnitude lower than the inputs of E. colt from upstream of the estuary. This result suggests that mitigation efforts for the Yarra estuary may need to focus also on areas upstream, as well as those impervious areas contributing directly to the estuary.

ID TREE MORTALITY; INDEX; TEMPERATURES; CHINA; TESTS
AB Under global warming, droughts have become more severe and more frequent. In this context, it is widely accepted that both water supply (e.g., precipitation, PRE) and demand (e.g., potential evapotranspiration, PET) should be considered in drought assessments due to increasing evapotranspiration. China's Yellow River basin is located mainly in arid and semi-arid regions that suffer severe droughts. Analyzing the temporal and spatial patterns of droughts in this area and exploring the relative effects of supply and demand on drought occurrence and variations are thus necessary to adapt to increased droughts. Here, we compared three kinds of drought indices, including the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the standardized precipitation index (SPI), and the standardized evapotranspiration deficit Index (SEDI), and used SPEI to identify droughts in the Yellow River basin during the six decades from 1956 to 2016. We identified droughts and described drought dynamics based on drought duration, intensity, frequency, and spatial extent. We then evaluated the relative contributions of PRE and PET to droughts of varying severity and long-term trend, as well as the relationships between ocean signals and droughts. Our results show that most of the basin has undergone progressively drier conditions since the 1950 s. This increased drought occurrence has manifested as longer, more frequent droughts affecting a larger spatial extent. PRE was the dominant driver (64%) of drought occurrence in an area of similar to 86% of the basin, whereas PET was the main driver (55%) in the remaining 14% of the basin. However, changes in PET contributed more than PRE to drought variation, i.e., long-term SPEI trends, in about similar to 60% of the area. And effects of PET increased during severer droughts due to the intensive interaction between soil moisture and atmospheric water demand in highly arid conditions. Physically, droughts were closely related to several ocean signals, such as the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index (AMO), and the Arctic Oscillation index (AO), at different time scales. Understandings of drought dynamics, their physical mechanisms, and the effects of PRE and PET on droughts of varying severity are essential for water resource management, especially in arid regions.

AB Global mangrove forests have exhibited distinct changes in past decades owing to diverse environmental gradients and regional anthropogenic activities. Previous studies have mainly reported alarming mangrove loss. However, few studies have focused on the process of mangrove expansion, and its driving factors remain unclear. By integrating medium-resolution Landsat surface reflectance products and meteorological, hydrological and bathymetric data, the current study investigates the spatiotemporal changes of mangrove forests in Shenzhen Inner Bay (SZIB) of China over the past thirty years, and the relationship between mangrove changes and natural and anthropogenic factors was also identified. The results reveal that the area of mangrove forests in the SZIB increased at a rapid rate of 8.9 ha/yr despite sea level rise, reaching 527.1 ha in 2017. No statistically significant correlation between mangrove area and winter temperature and precipitation was found, whereas a significant positive correlation occurred between mangrove area and sea level rise, in contrast to the common consensus. Human activities affected the SZIB mangroves in two distinct ways. On the one hand, the area of mangrove deforestation occurred on 23.5 ha and 6.8 ha in the Futian and Mai Po reserves, respectively, with reforestation campaigns only compensating for 5.6 ha of the mangrove area lost in the Futian reserve. On the other hand, the reduced tidal prism due to the implementation of the Shenzhen Bay Land Reclamation Project (SZBLRP) resulted in significant deposition in the SZIB, which counterbalanced the negative effect of sea level rise, contributing to 209.9 ha of mangrove expansion by providing suitable accommodation space and accounting for 78.4% of the total mangrove gain. Moreover, the morphological adjustments in the SZIB caused by the Shenzhen River Regulation Project (SZRRP) also had a significant influence on the mangrove extent and distribution, with the mangrove expansion area of 22.7 ha being contributed by the SZRRP, accounting for 8.5% of the total mangrove expansion. The findings of the current study indicate that with the increased sediment supply and accretion rate induced by anthropogenic activities, mangrove forests with limited land retreat space can still expand in the face of sea level rise.

AB Flash floods represent one of the most destructive natural hazards in the Mediterranean region. These floods result from very intense and spatially heterogeneous rainfall events. Distributed hydrological models are valuable tools to study these phenomena and increase our knowledge on the main processes governing the generation and propagation of floods over large spatial scales. They are generally built using a bottom-up approach that generalizes small-physics representations of processes. However, top-down or data-driven approach is increasingly shown to provide also valuable knowledge. A simplified semi distributed continuous hydrological model, named SIMPLEFLOOD, was developed, based on the simple dynamical system approach (SDSA) proposed by Kirchner (WRR, 2009, 45, W02429), and applied to the Ardeche catchment in France (2388 km(2)). This data-driven method assumes that discharge at the outlet of a given catchment can be expressed as a function only of catchment storage. It leads to a 3-parameter nonlinear model according to rainfall and runoff observations. This model was distributed over sub-catchments and coupled with a kinematic wave based flow propagation module. The parameters were estimated by discharge recession analyses at several gauged stations. Parameter regionalization was conducted using a Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Hierarchical Classification on Principal Component (HCPC) in order to find relationships between the SDSA approach and catchments characteristics. Geology was found to be the main predictor of hydrological response variability and model parameters were regionalized according to the dominant geology. The SIMPLEFLOOD model was applied for a 12-year continuous simulation over the Ardeche catchment. Four flash flood events were also selected for further analysis. The simulated hydrographs were compared with the observations at 11 gauging stations with catchment size ranging from 17 to 2300 km(2). The results show a good performance of the model for the continuous and flash flood events occurring under wet conditions, whereas the model underestimates discharge for events occurring after a long dry period. The simple modeling approach provided interesting insight into the Ardeche catchment functioning and offers perspective for a better simulation of flash floods, mainly under wet conditions.

ID UNSATURATED FLOW; SOIL; TRANSPORT
AB Porous media biofilters (PMBs) are commonly used to treat domestic wastewater. Biomats develop at the infiltrative surface of PMBs due to continued wastewater application and create an impedance to flow. The goal of this research is to quantify the temporal evolution of normalized biomat hydraulic conductivity (K-bm/b(bm)) and effective hydraulic conductivity (K-e). K-e is the overall hydraulic conductivity of the infiltrative zone, including biomat and unsaturated media below the biomat. Research was conducted using eight one-dimensional (1D) sand columns with gravel-free and gravel-laden infiltrative surfaces. The columns were loaded at design rates of 100-200 cm/d for 20 weeks of column operation. The K, values for these continuously loaded columns were determined from analyses of bromide-tracer tests, falling-head permeability tests, and volumetric water content measurements during biomat development. The reduction in the K-e due to biomat formation is due to two factors: reduced hydraulic conductivity of the thin biomat, and a reduced hydraulic conductivity of the subsoil due to development of a biomatinduced unsaturated flow regime. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivities of the subsoil below the biomat (K-ss) were estimated from capillary curves and water content measurements. For observed final biomat thicknesses (less than I cm), the biomat hydraulic conductivity, K-bm, is three orders of magnitude smaller than the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-ss). However, the relatively large thickness of the vadose zone causes the K-ss to be an important contributor to the overall K-e value. For these columns, the final Ke values were approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the original value. Because the exact thickness of the biomat (b(bm)) is unknown during the flow experiments, the hydraulic conductance of the biomat zone is presented using a normalized hydraulic conductivity function (K-bm/b(bm)). A similar K-bm/b(bm) is reached regardless of wastewater loading rate. An exponential relationship exists between the volume of wastewater applied to the column and both K, and K-bm/b(bm).

AB Water resources in Mediterranean regions are under increasing pressure due to climate change, economic development, and population growth. Many Mediterranean rivers have their headwaters in mountainous regions where hydrological processes are driven by snowpack dynamics and the specific variability of the Mediterranean climate. A good knowledge of the snow processes in the Mediterranean mountains is therefore a key element of water management strategies in such regions. The objective of this paper is to review the literature on snow hydrology in Mediterranean mountains to identify the existing knowledge, key research questions, and promising technologies. We collected 620 peer-reviewed papers, published between 1913 and 2016, that deal with the Mediterranean-like mountain regions in the western United States, the central Chilean Andes, and the Mediterranean basin. A large amount of studies in the western United States form a strong scientific basis for other Mediterranean mountain regions. We found that: (1) the persistence of snow cover is highly variable in space and time but mainly controlled by elevation and precipitation; (2) the snowmelt is driven by radiative fluxes, but the contribution of heat fluxes is stronger at the end of the snow season and during heat waves and rain-on-snow events; (3) the snow densification rates are higher in these regions when compared to other climate regions; and (4) the snow sublimation is an important component of snow ablation, especially in high-elevation regions. Among the pressing issues is the lack of continuous ground observation in high-elevation regions. However, a few years of snow depth (HS) and snow water equivalent (SWE) data can provide realistic information on snowpack variability. A better spatial characterization of snow cover can be achieved by combining ground observations with remotely sensed snow data. SWE reconstruction using satellite snow cover area and a melt model provides reasonable information that is suitable for hydrological applications. Further advances in our understanding of the snow processes in Mediterranean snow dominated basins will be achieved by finer and more accurate representation of the climate forcing. While the theory on the snowpack energy and mass balance is now well established, the connections between the snow cover and the water resources involve complex interactions with the sub-surface processes, which demand future investigation.

AB Whilst policy makers have tended to adopt an Information-deficit model' to bolster levels of flood-risk preparedness primarily though communication strategies promoting awareness, the assumed causal relation between awareness and preparedness is empirically weak. As such, there is a growing interest amongst scholars and policy makers alike to better understand why at-risk individuals are underprepared. In this vein, empirical studies, typically employing quantitative methods, have tended to focus on exploring the extent to which flood-risk preparedness levels vary depending not only on sociodemographic variables, but also (and increasingly so) the perceptual factors that influence flood risk preparedness. This study builds upon and extends this body of research by offering a more solution-focused approach that seeks to identify how pathways to flood-risk preparedness can be opened up. Specifically, through application of a qualitative methodology, we seek to explore how the factors that negatively influence flood-risk preparedness can be addressed to foster a shift towards greater levels of mitigation behaviour. In doing so, we focus our analysis on an urban community in Ireland that is identified as 'at risk' of flash flooding and is currently undergoing significant flood relief works. In this regard, the case study offers an interesting laboratory to explore how attitudes towards flood-risk preparedness at the individual level are being influenced within the context of a flood relief scheme that is only partially constructed. In order to redress the dearth of theoretically informed qualitative studies in this field, we draw on Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to help guide our analysis and make sense of our results. Our findings demonstrate that flood-risk preparedness can be undermined by low levels of efficacy amongst individuals in terms of the preparedness measures available to them and their own personal capacity to implement them. We also elucidate that the 'levee effect' can occur before engineered flood defences are fully constructed as the flood relief works within our case study are beginning to affect people's perception of flood risk in the case study area. We conclude by arguing that (1) individuals' coping appraisals need to be enhanced through communication strategies and other interventions which highlight that future floods may not replicate past events; and (2) the concept of residual risk needs to be communicated at all stages of a flood relief scheme, not just upon completion.

AB Floods are one of the most perilous natural calamities that cause property destruction and endanger human life. The spatial patterns of flood susceptibility were assessed in this study using six applied machine learning (ML) models including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). A flood inventory map was provided using 180 flood points and 180 non-flood points. Both flood and non-flood locations were randomly partitioned into training and testing datasets with the ratio of 70:30. Sixteen various meteorological, hydrological, and geospatial variables were considered in the flood susceptibility assessment. The multi-collinearity analysis was performed to measure the intensity of correlations between the variables and deter-mine whether factors can be included in the flood susceptibility assessment. From a total of sixteen variables, thirteen were chosen based on the multi-collinearity study. The five statistical indices Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC), Jaccard index, F1 score, Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa coefficient (K) were used to evaluate models' performance. Regarding the results of accuracy criteria, the RF model had the best predictive potential. Flood conditioning factors were reclassified using Quantile classification method and the importance of each class from a given flood conditioning factor was evaluated using the Frequency Ratio (FR) method. Additionally, the spatial relationship between the flood conditioning factors and the flood susceptibility map was investigated using the correlation matrix based on the Spearman correlation analysis. Findings of the correlation matrix revealed that the most important flood conditioning factors, in order of importance, were lithology, drainage density, distance from rivers, soil, rainfall, land cover, and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). The flood susceptibility map, as the principal output of this study, was produced in five classes ranging from very low to very high susceptibility. The flood susceptibility map provided using the RF model (i.e., the model with the highest accuracy) indicated that the flood susceptibility is very high in 19.73% of the study area, high in 15.49%, moderate in 16.15%, low in 18.72%, and very low in 29.91%. Findings of this research might be an invaluable resource for better management of flooding since it specifically emphasized the primary causes of flooding as well as locations of heightened flood susceptibility.

AB Potential evaporation (E-p) reflects the combined effects of four key meteorological variables: (i) net radiation (R-n); (ii) wind speed (u); (iii) relative humidity (rh); and (iv) air temperature (T-a). Here, attribution analysis was conducted to investigate the contribution of the four key meteorological variables to changes of a physically-based E-p in a large water-limited basin, the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. Then the influences of these changes, and precipitation (P) changes, on streamflow (Q) were explored analytically. Results show that: (i) E-p presented different temporal trends for the water yielding region (WYR) and water consuming region (WCR) with a overall changes of +0.16 mm a(-2) and 0.66 mm a(-2) during 1961-2010, respectively; (ii) trend analysis of E-p and the four key meteorological variables at the basin scale showed that increasing trend in T-a increased E-p during 1961-2010, while changes in R-n and u increased the 1961-1979 E-p rate and reduced it during 1980-1994 and 1995-2010; (iii) revealed by attribution analysis, E-p increased by changes in T-a and rh and reduced by changes of R-n and u in both WYR and WCR, in all, Er rate presented positive and negative trends in the WYR and WCR, respectively; (iv) the changes of Q and actual evaporation (E) are much more sensitive to changes in P than the changes in E-p; and (v) of critical importance for water resource management of the YRB changes in Q are mainly attributed to changes in catchment-specific parameter (n) and P. while E-p reduced Q in WYR and increased Q in WCR. These results indicated that the causes of trend of E-p rates, influenced by combined effects of radiative and aerodynamic variables should be explicitly explained using fully physically based E-p formulations. Additionally, in the water-limited YRB, changes of Q are primarily controlled by the changes in catchment conditions, and secondarily by hydroclimatic factors where the available water (P) rather than energy condition (E-p) is more important. Better understanding all of these relationships and how they have varied will help water resource management in a changing climate. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Spatial rainfall is a key input to distributed hydrological models, and its precisions heavily affect the accuracy of stream flow predictions from a hydrological model. Traditional interpolation techniques which obtain the spatial rainfall distribution from rain gauge data have some limitations caused by data scarcity and bad quality, especially in developing countries or remote locations. Satellite-based precipitation products are expected to offer an alternative to ground-based rainfall estimates in the present and the foreseeable future. For this purpose, the quality and usefulness of satellite-based precipitation products need to be evaluated. The present study compares the difference of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall with rain gauges data at different time scales and evaluates the usefulness of the TRMM rainfall for hydrological processes simulation and water balance analysis at the Xinjiang catchment, located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. The results show at daily time step TRMM rainfall data are better at determining rain occurrence and mean values than at determining the rainfall extremes, and larger difference exists for the maximal daily and maximal 5-day rainfalls. At monthly time scale, good linear relationships between TRMM rainfall and rain gauges rainfall data are received with the determination coefficients (R-2) varying between 0.81 and 0.89 for the individual stations and 0.88 for areal average rainfall data, respectively. But the slope of regression line ranges between 0.74 for Yingtan and 0.94 for Yushan, indicating that the TRMM satellite is inclined to underestimate the monthly rainfall in this area. The simulation of daily hydrological processes shows that the Water Flow Model for Lake Catchment (WATLAC) model using conventional rain gauge data produces an overall good fit, but the simulation results using TRMM rainfall data are discontented. The evaluation results imply that the TRMM rainfall data are unsuited for daily stream flow simulation in this study area with desired precisions. However, good performance can be received using TRMM rainfall data for monthly stream flow simulations. The comparison of the simulated annual water balance components shows that the different rainfall data sources can change the volume value and proportion of water balance components to some extent, but it generally meets the need of practical use.

AB Under the influences of global climate change and intense human activities, the hydrological and biogeochemical processes have been undergoing profound changes in most of the world's watersheds. However, the long-term changes in streamflow, sediment load, and nutrient fluxes, and quantitative attribution of these changes from a basin-wide perspective are incompletely understood. Here we examined the trends of streamflow, sediment load, and total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes in the Mis-sissippi River Basin (MRB) and its four major tributary basins during the 1930s-2010s, and major causes for streamflow, sediment load and nutrient fluxes changes were quantified. The streamflow increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the entire basin except for the Arkansas River Basin, while the sediment load significantly decreased except in the Arkansas River Basin and Upper MRB. Generally, the TN flux reduced except for an increasing trend in the Upper MRB. While the TP flux rose except for a decrease in the Ohio River Basin, and the DIC flux increased significantly. The strength of the relationship between nutrient flux and streamflow/sediment load showed four binary patterns, and in general the nutrient fluxes were more strongly correlated with streamflow compared to sediment load. Over the past 80 years, the increasing precipitation in the MRB has made the most contribution (67 % on average) to the river discharge increase, whereas human activities contribute the most (>58 %) to the changes in the sediment load and nutrient fluxes. The sediment yield coefficient decreased lin-early with the increasing impermeable area proportion, river revetment length, and dam storage capacity (p < 0.05) in the MRB. The decrease in TN flux probably resulted from sedimentation and denitrification in reservoirs and wetlands, and increases in farm fertilizer and manure use were the two main factors contributing to the increased TP flux. In addition, the agricultural practices, increased precipitation, and raised temperature jointly led to an increase in the DIC flux. This study provides quantitative results of water-sediment-nutrient variations in the entire watershed system, which facilitates development of watershed management strategies.

AB Fractures are effective seepage channels and storage spaces for oil, gas, and groundwater. Understanding the distribution characteristics of fractures can improve the efficiency of water production and the control of water -related geohazards in fractured aquifers. The development and distribution of natural fractures are usually controlled by paleotectonic stress fields. In this study, the data obtained from outcrop, cores, and thin sections were used to determine the development characteristics of such fractures. By doing an analysis of burial history, tectonic evolution, acoustic emission test, rock mechanics test, and conjugate joint analysis, two-dimensional (2D) heterogeneous geomechanical models were established by using a finite element method (FEM) stress analysis approach to simulate paleotectonic stress fields during the Indosinian, Early Yanshanian and Late Yanshanian periods. The effects of the variations of paleotectonic stress fields, hydrodynamic fields, structures, and rock mechanical parameters on the development of fractures could then be identified. A calculation model for the rock rupture rate was established to determine the quantitative development of fractures in different periods. Favorable areas for natural fracture development were determined by examining the relationship be-tween the fracture linear density and pumping capacity of eleven wells. The simulation results indicate that the distributions of the maximum and minimum principal stresses and the maximum shear stress were nonuniform during the Indosinian, Early Yanshanian and Late Yanshanian periods, and high stress and/or low stress were mostly distributed in the fault and fold belts. During the Indosinian period, the tectonic and dissolution fractures were not developed. During the Early and Late Yanshanian periods, the tectonic and dissolution fractures were primarily developed around the fault and fold belts in the NNW-SSE and NWW-SEE directions. Those fault and fold belts are the locations with the greatest development of the natural fractures, which are also the main channels for the migration and accumulation of karst groundwater in the Ordovician formation in the Huainan coalfield. This study provides an important reference for the prevention and control of the Ordovician karst water damage in the study area, and proposes a new method for the prediction of fractured carbonate reservoirs.

AB Chloride exports from the widespread application of road salt serve as a primary contribution to water body salinity in cold climate regions. Road salt pollution is a concern in drinking water supplies due to the relationship between chloride concentration and water corrosivity. In the Northeastern U.S., researchers and water quality managers are interested in better understanding how management practices can mitigate the negative effects of road salt pollution. This study uses regression-based chloride load estimates from LOADEST to produce mass balances and analyze transport flow-paths to the Wachusett Reservoir from a predominantly rural watershed. A chloride mass balance for 2000 through 2019 revealed that reservoir and watershed export only recently reached a level similar to estimated inputs from road salt (11,200 ton/yr). Results from hydrograph and load separation techniques show that average loading (4300 +/- 1300 ton/yr) and discharge from baseflow (3.2 +/- 0.9 m(3)/s) contributed approximately 74% and 65% of the total loading (5800 +/- 1800 ton/yr) and discharge (4.93 +/- 1.50 m(3)/s), respectively from water years 2001 through 2019. Approximately 40% of the total annual tributary load (30% baseflow; 10% runoff) occurred in the spring (March-May) and is attributed to elevated baseflow conditions from snowmelt. As indicated by a baseflow chloride index, baseflow concentrations are 14% greater than the total concentrations measured in the tributaries. Therefore, the baseflow-dominated tributary chloride loading is due to a combination of greater discharge and chloride concentration in baseflow as compared to direct surface runoff. However, a long-term trend analysis suggests a slightly increased fraction of chloride loading via overland flow in several reservoir tributaries, potentially indicative of late 20th century land development. This study offers a unique monitoring approach for management authorities to better assess road salt pollution in water systems. The decadal response of the reservoir system reflects the slow-moving nature of the baseflow-dominated chloride loading and suggests that measurable water quality improvements will only be realized with a sustained long-term decrease in the amount of road salt applied.

TI Intra-specific variability in deep water extraction between trees

AB Plant transpiration is a major component of water fluxes in the critical zone, which needs to be better characterized to improve our ability to understand and model the hydrological cycle. In water-limited ecosystems such as those encountered on karst environments, climate-induced changes in transpiration are expected to be strongly influenced by the ability of the vegetation cover to resist or adapt to drought. However, because of the high heterogeneity of karst environments, the amount of water available for trees can change within a stand, which may lead to significant differences in drought vulnerability resistance between trees of the same species. So far it is not known if soil and subsoil environment influence the magnitude of deep water extraction, at the intra-specific scale. Here, we investigate the variability in deep water extraction for six individual Quercus ilex trees growing on a karst substrate in a Mediterranean forest. We combined three approaches: (i) electrical resistivity tomography to determine the variability of soil/subsoil characteristics, (ii) isotope tracing to determine the origin of water transpired by plants, and (iii) predawn and midday leaf water potential (Psi) to assess the trees' water stress and transpiration regulation. Along the summer season, deep water extraction increased with drought intensity. Deep water use varies between individuals and according to drought intensity. At moderate water stress levels, we found no significant relationship between the origin of xylem water and soil/subsoil characteristics or individual stress level. However, at the peak of the drought (average predawn Psi < -2 MPa), individuals that had the least total available water in soil/subsoil (0-2 m) relied more on deep water and were also subject to less water stress. These results suggest that trees with less favorable soil/subsoil conditions (i.e. low water retention capacity) in the near surface (0-2 m) adapt their root systems to exploit deep water reserves more intensively so as to enhance their drought tolerance, while trees with more favorable surface conditions exhibit greater water stress and may be more vulnerable to extreme droughts because of a lower root development in deeper horizons.

AB Dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) may be highly enriched in groundwater. However, the contribution of groundwater discharge as a source of CO2 to rivers, estuaries and coastal waters is poorly understood. We performed high resolution measurements of radon (Rn-222, a natural groundwater tracer) and the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in a highly modified tidal creek and estuary (North Creek, Richmond River, New South Wales, Australia) to assess whether CO2 in surface waters was driven by groundwater discharge. A spatial survey revealed increasing Rn-222 activities (up to 17.3 dpm L-1) and pCO(2) (up to 11,151 mu atm) in the upstream direction. The enrichment occurred in a drained coastal acid sulphate soil wetland upstream of a mangrove forest. Time series experiments (24-h) were performed at two stations upstream and downstream of the pCO(2) enrichment area. Upstream measurements demonstrated a significant correlation between pCO(2) and Rn-222 while downstream values resulted in a significant inverse relationship between pCO(2) and dissolved oxygen apparently as a result of respiration in nearby mangroves. Measurements taken 2 days after a 245 mm precipitation event revealed the highest recorded Rn-222 activities (up to 86.1 dpm L-1) and high pCO(2) (up to 11,217 mu atm), showing a strong groundwater influence after flooding. These observations imply that groundwater discharge drove CO2 dynamics at the upstream station while multiple complex processes drove CO2 at the downstream station. A Rn-222 mass balance model demonstrated that groundwater discharge accounted for about 76% of surface water in this floodplain creek. The CO2 evasion rates (799 +/- 225 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) were driven primarily by currents rather than wind. Groundwater-derived CO2 fluxes into the creek averaged 1622 mmol m(-2) d(-1), a value twice as high as atmospheric CO2 evasion and consistent with carbon uptake within the creek and down-stream exports. These results demonstrate that groundwater seepage was a major factor driving CO2 evasion to the atmosphere from the creek. Groundwater discharge should be accounted for in CO2 budgets in coastal systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Downscaling is a technique commonly used to transform the outputs of a low resolution climate model to a finer scale suitable for regional hydrological modelling. The technique is an important component in studies investigating the impact of climate change on runoff. This study assesses a simple analogue downscaling method - the statistically based method of Timbal and McAvaney (2001) to provide daily rainfall series for modelling runoff across southeast Australia. Using 10 global climate models (GCMs), the historical and future rainfall and runoff generated by this method were compared with the results from an empirical scaling method. We find that the analogue method can be used with hydrological models to simulate long-term average runoff over large regions reasonably well provided a suitable 'inflation factor' is applied. Without the correction, biases are too large for direct input to hydrological models. Even with appropriate inflation, the daily rainfall distribution from the analogue method will not be the same as the observed distribution, and this may lead to unreliable simulations of daily runoff characteristics. Comparing the analogue method and the empirical scaling method on the basis of change in future runoff, averaged across the entire study region, the results are generally similar with large majority of the GCMs showing a decline in future runoff. In the cases when there are differences, the additional climatic response produced by the analogue method appears to be a consequence of using atmospheric moisture variable as a predictor in certain regions. The range in the future rainfall and runoff projections from the analogue method is smaller than that from the empirical scaling. This is because compared to the empirical scaling, which uses rainfall derived from as many as 10 different parameterisations in the GCMs, the analogue method uses a single relationship between synoptic atmospheric fields and rainfall for all the GCMs. This, and the fact that the analogue method models future changes at the relevant catchment scale and captures changes to a larger range of rainfall characteristics, are the advantages of the analogue method. Nevertheless, more research is required to improve daily rainfall series for direct input into hydrological models to fully realise the potential of analogue downscaling for hydrological applications.

AB Better knowledge regarding internal soil moisture and piezometric responses in the process of rainfall-induced shallow slope failures is the key to an effective prediction of the landslide and/or debris flow initiation. To this end, internal soil moisture and piezometric response of 0.7-m-deep, 1.5-m-wide, 1.7-m-high, and 3.94-m-long semi-infinite sandy slopes rested on a bi-linear impermeable bedrock were explored using a chute test facility with artificial rainfall applications. The internal response time defined by the inflection point of the soil moisture and piezometric response curves obtained along the soil-bedrock interface were closely related to some critical failure states, such as the slope toe failure and extensive slope failures. It was also found that the response times obtained at the point of abrupt bedrock slope decrease can be used as indicators for the initiation of rainfall-induced shallow slope failures. An investigation of spatial distributions of soil water content, omega (or degrees of saturation, S-r), in the slope at critical failure states shows that the 0.2 m - below - surface zone remains unsaturated with S-r (sic) 40-60%, regardless of their distances from the toe and the rainfall intensity. Non-uniform distributions of omega (or S-r) along the soil-bedrock interface at critical failure states were always associated with near-saturation states (Sr (sic) 80-100%) around the point of bedrock slope change or around the transient 'toe' upstream of the slumped mass induced by the retrogressive failure of the slope. These observations suggest the important role of the interflow along the soil-bedrock interface and the high soil water content (or high porewater pressure) around the point of bedrock slope deflection in the rainfall-induced failure of sandy slopes consisting of shallow impermeable bedrocks. The present study proposes an 'internal response time' criterion to substantiate the prediction of rainfall-induced shallow slope failures. It is believed that the 'internal response time' reflects the overall characteristics of a slope under rainfall infiltration and can be as useful as the conventional meteorology-based threshold times. The 'internal response time' theory can be generalized via numerical modeling of slope hydrology, slope geology and slope stability in the future. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Well hydraulics; Slug test; High permeability aquifers; Annulus;

ID RESPONSE TESTS; AQUIFERS; WELLS; MODEL
AB We derive a closed form theory of water level fluctuations caused by slug tests in a well with an annulus that extends to the piezometric surface. This hydraulics can be created by small diameter slug test equipment in a large diameter well, with an annulus established by borehole casing and the riser pipe of the equipment. The conservation of mass equation couples aquifer hydraulics, core hydraulics inside the riser pipe (which include inertia), and annular hydraulics outside the riser pipe (which include inertia and linear friction). The linear friction is needed to attenuate oscillations between the core and annulus, which would otherwise persist indefinitely after damping of aquifer discharge. A characteristic velocity is adopted for the annular friction, so that aquifer permeability is the sole calibration parameter. We calibrate the theory with overdamped and underdamped experiments run in a limestone aquifer at the Hydrogeological Experimental Site of Poitiers in France by Audouin, O., Bodin, J. 2007. Analysis of slug tests with high frequency oscillations. journal of Hydrology 334, 282-289. The data and analytical theory yield plausible, accurate permeability estimates of 4.1 x 10(-12) and 1.7 x 10(-11) m(2). Portable, small diameter slug testing devices may accordingly be used in permanent, large diameter cased boreholes to estimate aquifer permeability, although the annular effects can obscure aquifer hydraulics. The annular effects may also occur in slug tests on wells with skins, bypasses, and packers, although different boundary and matching conditions would be needed to model this hydraulics.

AB MODIS fractional (FSC) and binary (BSC) snow-cover data are important for obtaining accurate spatiotemporal snow-cover information for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) where rapid warming is closely related to snow-cover changes. However, FSC and BSC data are no longer provided in the newly released version (v6) of the MODIS snow cover product, having been replaced with normalized difference snow index (NDSI) data. Recent studies have observed clearly lower accuracy of MODIS snow cover data on the TP than in other areas, possibly implying that there are strong scaling effects due to the complex terrain and land cover which are not well understood. A total of 353 Landsat-8 scenes covering most parts of the TP are used to establish a new empirical relationship between FSC and MODIS NDSI for FSC estimation and a new NDSI threshold for BSC estimation. The results indicate that the new regression model (mean root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD): 0.22) has a better FSC estimation accuracy than the previously used global reference equation (mean RMSD: 0.24) and that the new NDSI threshold of 0.29 (mean Cohen's Kappa (CK): 0.49) outperforms the global reference NDSI threshold of 0.4 (mean CK: 0.40) in BSC estimation. The relatively low accuracy could be due to an enhanced scaling effect. The 30-m Landsat-8 NDSI data are upscaled to 500-m (MODIS) to analyze the scaling effects on FSC and BSC estimates made using MODIS NDSI. We find that the methods using MODIS NDSI have much lower estimation accuracy, for both FSC and BSC, compared with those using upscaled Landsat-8 NDSI. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test which considers 512 combinations of aspect, slope and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) further demonstrates that the enhanced scaling effects are mainly caused by terrain factors (i.e. aspect and slope). The optimal NDSI threshold for estimating BSC generally increases with slope and decreases as the aspect varies from the southeast to northwest. This study has important implications for the optimal use of MODIS NDSI snow cover data on the TP and highlights the importance of developing more advanced methods which take more factors into account.

AB As the important part of carbon cycle research, riverine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) has attracted continuous attentions for its close relationship with global climate change. In order to investigate the dominant factors of dissolved inorganic carbon species and its stable carbon isotopic signals in large watershed under base flow condition, 81 river water samples were collected in the Xijiang River during the dry season in 2015. The elemental ratios in river water revealed the hydro-chemistry in Xijiang River were mainly controlled by the carbonate weathering. The characteristics of the most samples were the high DIC concentrations and narrow range of beta C-13(DIC), which can be interpreted as the result of chemical weathering under open system based on the simulated calculation of soil respiration and mineral dissolution. The relatively lower DIC concentrations and beta C-13(DIC) values have been observed in tributaries draining silicate terrains, this result may be controlled both by the mineral dissolution and CO2 outgassing. Most samples had the over-saturated pCO(2) levels compared to the atmosphere, the respiratory quotient (RQ) demonstrated that high pCO(2) values were not from the biologic respiration, instead, the groundwater influx with the high soil pCO(2) increased pCO(2) level in river waters. The CO2 concentration gradient between river water and atmosphere caused a violent CO2 outgassing accompanied isotope fractionation. The outgassing significantly dropped the pCO(2) in river water and caused an enrichment of C-13 in DIC. Based on the theoretical calculation and previous observation, the negative correlation between the beta C-13(DIC) and pCO(2) in river water was caused by the CO2 outgassing. Additionally, the isotope exchange between the DIC and atmosphere CO2 can also partially increase the riverine CO2. This study examined the impacts of soil respiration, minerals dissolution and CO2 outgassing on DIC and beta C-13(DIC), and found that the riverine beta C-13(DIC) is probably not reflect the mixing of source signals such as soil CO2 and carbonate, instead, it is mainly controlled by the fractionation in minerals dissolution and CO2 outgassing.

AB Hydrogeologic units (HGUs), representing subsurface contrasts in hydraulic conductivity, form the basis for all conceptual and numerical models of groundwater flow. However, conventionally, delineation of these units relies heavily on data sets indirect with respect to hydraulic properties. Here, we use the spatial and temporal characteristics of the vertical component of hydraulic gradient (i.e., vertical gradient) as the primary line of evidence for delineating HGUs for Cambrian-Ordovician sedimentary rocks at a site in Dane County, Wisconsin. The site includes a 16 km(2) area encompassing a 3 km long mixed organic contaminants plume. The vertical gradients are derived from hydraulic head profiles obtained using high resolution Westbay multilevel systems installed at 7 locations along two, orthogonal 4 km long cross sections and monitoring to depths between 90 and 146 m with an average of 3-4 monitoring zones per 10 m. These vertical gradient cross-sections reveal 11 laterally extensive HGUs with contrasting vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v). The position and thickness of the K-v contrasts are consistently associated with sequence stratigraphic features (maximum flooding intervals and sequence boundaries) distinguished at the site using cores and borehole geophysical logs. The same sequence stratigraphic features are also traceable across much of the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer system of the Midwest US. The vertical gradients and sequence stratigraphy were arrived at independently and when combined provide a hydraulically calibrated sequence stratigraphic framework for the site. This framework provides increased confidence in the precise delineation and description of the nature of HGU contacts in each borehole, reduced uncertainty in interpolation of the HGUs between boreholes, and some capability to predict HGU boundaries and thickness in offsite areas where high resolution hydraulic data sets are not available. Consequently, this HGU conceptual model will serve as a better basis for numerical simulations of groundwater flow and contaminant transport needed for continued risk assessment and to evaluate potential remedial technologies for the site. More broadly, the association between K-v contrasts and sequence stratigraphy demonstrated at this site provides valuable insight into the relationship between geology and hydraulic contrasts that can be transferred to other areas of the upper Midwest US and perhaps elsewhere to strata deposited in similar settings.

AB Alpine meadow soil is an important ecosystem component of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. However, the alpine meadow soil is undergoing serious degradation mainly due to global climate change, overgrazing, human activities and rodents. In this paper, spatial sequencing was chosen over time succession sequencing to study the changes of soil hydraulic properties under different degrees of alpine meadow degradation. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and Gardner alpha both at the surface and at 40-50 cm depth were investigated in the field using tension infiltrometers. Soil physical and chemical properties, together with the root index at 0-10 cm and 40-50 cm soil layer depths were also analyzed. Pearson correlations were adopted to study the relationships among the investigated factors and principal component analysis was performed to identify the dominant factor. Results show that with increasing degree of degradation, soil sand content increased while soil Ks and Gardner alpha as well as soil clay content, soil porosity decreased in the 0-10 cm soil layers, and organic matter and root gravimetric density decreased in both the 0-10 cm and 40-50 cm soil layers. However, soil moisture showed no significant changes with increasing degradation. With decreasing pressure head, soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity reduced more slowly under degraded conditions than non-degraded conditions. Soil Ks and Gardner alpha were significantly correlated (P = 0.01) with bulk density, soil porosity, soil organic matter and root gravimetric density. Among these, soil porosity is the dominant factor explaining about 90% of the variability in total infiltration flow. Under non-degraded conditions, the infiltration flow principally depended on the presence of macropores. With increasing degree of degradation, soil macropores quickly changed to mesopores or micropores. The proportion of total infiltration flow through macropores and mesopores significantly decreased with the most substantial decrease observed for the macropores in the 0-10 cm soil layer. The substantial decrease of macropores caused a cut in soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity. This study improves the understanding and prediction of alpine meadow soil and ecosystem changes and provides guidelines for improving water flow modeling under the background of global climate change over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and similar regions.

ID SYSTEM
AB Concepts such as catchment, basin, watershed and river are commonly understood in many fields of discourse, but are described differently according to the focus on various aspects of the hydrology phenomenon. The effective exchange of hydrologic data containing references to hydrologic features requires standardised semantics of the concepts that allow identification of these features. Here, the scope of common approaches to information modelling of hydrologic features is examined, and is compared to the requirements for feature identification in multiple contexts. A conceptual model is presented that reconciles the underlying differences in representation of hydrologic features and levels of detail in typical datasets. By providing a stable and common referencing system for hydrologic features, the model will assist in the organization of observation and modelling of such features, and in the aggregation of generated data on a global, regional, national or basin scale.
   The model encompasses a number of approaches used in different contexts to identify and model hydrologic features and enforce the semantics of relationships between different levels of detail. Thus, it provides a semantic framework for common feature identifiers to be developed and embedded in individual data products, while providing the flexibility to model complex hydrological processes at fine detail. The common identifiers can be used in aggregating data generated using high-detail models of processes, and in partitioning large and complex hydrologic feature datasets into local study areas. Different local models can be applied according to the dominant hydrologic processes and the amount of hydrometric monitoring available for each region.
   The model is intended to form the basis for standard practices under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization Commission for Hydrology. It is presented here to invite further testing, feedback and engagement in the process of its acceptance and implementation as an international standard for hydrologic feature identification. Based on the accepted International Organization for Standardization General Feature Model, it will be possible to realise, in a standardised way, the semantics of feature identification in tools for managing metadata documenting hydrologic datasets and products.

AB Thermal stratification occurs in deep reservoirs and causes an outflow temperature that is significantly different from the inflow temperature, which is harmful to the ecology of downstream reaches. Optimal operation of reservoirs using the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), which focuses on power generation, flood control, agricultural irrigation, navigation, etc., has been performed. However, the outflow temperature has not been considered. Focusing on this deficiency, we considered Sanbanxi Reservoir as a case study and used the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) by combining it with the calibrated 1-D General Lake Model. The trade-off relationships among three objectives, namely, total power generation (TPG), root-meansquare deviation between the inflow and outflow temperatures (RMSDtem) and weighted aggregate eco-index (EI) based on indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHAs) parameters, were estimated as Pareto frontiers during the storage period from March 15 to July 15. The results demonstrated the following. 1) Through reservoir reoperation, RMSDtem could be reduced by 1.60 degrees C from 5.99 to 4.39 degrees C at the expense of reducing TPG from 7.43 x 10(8) to 6.56 x 10(8) k.Wh (-11.8%) during a normal year. 2) The optimized operating schemes were extracted as Pareto frontiers, and the slope of the outflow discharge curve (SODC) could be a useful parameter for determining the operating scheme in practice. A large SODC yielded high TPG, a small SODC resulted in low RMSDtem, and a medium SODC yielded minimum EL The medium SODCs ranged from -0.1 to 0.4 m(3) /(s.d), -0.4 to 0.6 m(3)/(s.d), and -0.6 to 1.2 m(3)/(s.d) for dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. 3) As the yearly inflow increased, the absolute value of the SODC for the best individuals for a single objective became larger. The range of TPG and RMSDtem in the Pareto frontier expanded, and that of EI remained basically unchanged. The results of the Sanbanxi Reservoir can be applied to other reservoirs to support reservoir re-operation, especially for the deep reservoirs in southwest China that suffer from outflow-temperature problems.

AB Persistent eutrophication frequently causes toxic algal blooms, which is a serious threat to drinking water safety, food security, and public health. Nutrient thresholds, the maximum nutrient load that an aquatic ecosystem can absorb while meeting management objective, are key to avoiding and reducing blooms. The determination of thresholds relies on nutrient load-response curves. The spatial heterogeneity of large shallow lakes in terms of lake characteristics results in different curves shape among areas of the lake, which leads to spatial differences in thresholds. However, the spatial heterogeneity of thresholds is typically neglected; there are few methods to analyse the relationship between river loads and lake-specific area thresholds. Here, we proposed the Area Threshold Analysis Framework to analyse the spatial patterns of nutrient loads and thresholds in lakes. We first quantified the flow and load of the rivers entering the lake. The lake was then zoned and modelled to analyse area thresholds. Finally, an intuitive link between the nutrient loads of specific rivers and the thresholds of specific areas of the lake was established. The results showed a nonlinear without hysteresis response in all areas of Chaohu Lake; the nutrient loads and thresholds were highly variable in space, showing a trend of increasing and then decreasing from west to east. Flow density and wind might be important in influencing the spatial distribution of thresholds. The different effects of the wind and flow density on total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) lead to large differences in the thresholds with TP and Chl-a as management objectives, respectively. The large gap between nutrient loads and thresholds made it important for management to consider appropriate management goals to deal with unrealistic nutrient reductions. Achieving year-round Chl-a <= 30 mu g/ l in Chaohu Lake was easier than TP <= 0.05 mg/l, since for the latter, the Shiwuli, Paihe, and Nanfei river loads needed reductions of >80 %. In addition, for Area 1 and 2, it was more practical to first start meeting TP <= 0.05 mg/l for 2 or 3 seasons of the year than for 4 seasons. Overall, we developed a new framework for spatial threshold analysis and established an intuitive link between nutrient loads and thresholds in large shallow lakes. These results are valuable for understanding the threshold properties of spatially heterogeneous ecosystems in general and provide a reference for watershed nutrient management and ecological restoration of lakes.

AB A multiple tracer study was conducted in the coastal plain of Horonobe, northern Hokkaido, Japan. To accomplish reliable estimates of groundwater residence time, multiple tracer approach, employing both gaseous and nongaseous environmental tracers, and lumped parameter models (LPMs) were applied in combination. Environmental tracers including H-3, H-3/He-3, Cl-36, and SF6 were analyzed and compared with values estimated from LPMs to select the most appropriate tracer and models to describe groundwater flow regime in the study area. Time series of Cl-36/Cl input in the study area were reconstructed and used in the LPMs.
   From comparison of the analyzed and modeled results, an index of H-3/He-3 was selected as the most appropriate for investigation of the study area. The relationship between the H-3/He-3 index and Cl-36/Cl indicated reliability of the H-3/He-3 index, but Cl-36/Cl values of the samples were lower than the models. This discrepancy was caused by underestimation of Cl- concentration of recharging water in the calculation of Cl-36/Cl input. SF6 mixing ratios of the samples were slightly higher than the models and it suggested involvement of terrigenic SF6.
   Three well groups, northern Shimonuma wells (NSW), southern Shimonuma wells (SSW), and Hamasato wells (MW), were respectively consistent with exponential piston flow model (EPM), binary mixing model (BMM), and exponential mixing model (EMM). Relational expressions between the H-3/He-3 index and mean residence time or mixing fraction of young groundwater (assumed to contain no tritiogenic He-3) with old groundwater (all H-3 decayed to tritiogenic He-3) were obtained based on the models. The mean residence time determined from the H-3/He-3 index and the expressions were 19-78 years for NSW and 1-648 years for HW. The mixing fraction of young groundwater was less than 10% at all SSW.
   Nongaseous tracers, including Cl-36 are not influenced by factors specific for gaseous tracers, such as excess air and degassing. Analyses of multiple tracers, including both gaseous and nongaseous tracers, and comparison using LPMs were effective to show plausibility of the estimated residence time, and they contributed to understanding of groundwater flow regime in the study area.

AB Small sub-basins are numerous in Mediterranean area and global sedimentary budgets cannot be obtained without a detailed understanding of the hydroclimatic processes that govern sediment fluxes in these small river systems. In this study, the shape of the relationship between sediment concentration (C) and water discharge (Q) during flood events of a 31-years period (1973-2004) was analyzed at the outlet of the Wadi Sebdou basin (256 km(2)) in northwest Algeria, using a new graphical analysis method based on features of hysteresis loops. Each flood was decomposed as successive stages - each of which being characterized by a sediment rating curve - and used to quantify the contribution of diverse sediment sources within the basin. Seven common classes of hydrological events (single valued and six hysteresis loops: clockwise, counter-clockwise, eight-shaped, single valued plus one loop, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, and single valued plus at least two loops) were explored. Sediment supply from locally derived sources (or "base load") was high and reached 77% of total sediment yield for the study period, and was attributed to weathering of bed material or gullies. The remainder portion was derived from hill-slopes, re-suspension of fresh fine deposits in the river bed, or bank collapse. The ratio of suspended sediment load derived from active sediment source varies considerably from one flood to another depending on many factors, such as seasonality and antecedent type of flood. The simpler floods were the most frequent ones but produced less sediment. The most frequent floods were clockwise or anticlockwise (52% of floods) but brought only 34% of the total sediment flux. The 18% of the most complex floods (single valued plus at least two loops) produced more than 53% of the sediments, mainly supplied by base load (84%). Intra-annual variability was very high. Over 31-years, the five biggest floods cumulated 64% of the total sediment flux and were of three classes, the most complex floods being dominant. The largest contribution occurred during one single 33-days long hydrological event with complex form which represented 26% of the total sediment flux. Apart from the five biggest flood events, the base load represented 53%. The biggest floods favour base load as compared to the smallest ones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study developed and used an integrated modeling system, coupling a distributed hydrologic and a dynamic land-use change model, to examine effects of urbanization on annual runoff and flood events of the Qinhuai River watershed in Jiangsu Province, China. The Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) was used to calculate runoff generation and the integrated Markov Chain and Cellular Automata model (CA-Markov model) was used to develop future land use maps. The model was calibrated and validated using observed daily streamflow data collected at the two outlets of watershed. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1988, 1994, 2006, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images from 2001, 2003 and a China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) image from 2009 were used to obtain historical land use maps. These imageries revealed that the watershed experienced conversion of approximately 17% non-urban area to urban area between 1988 and 2009. The urbanization scenarios for various years were developed by overlaying impervious surfaces of different land use maps to 1988 (as a reference year) map sequentially. The simulation results of HEC-HMS model for the various urbanization scenarios indicate that annual runoff, daily peak flow, and flood volume have increased to different degrees due to urban expansion during the study period (1988-2009), and will continue to increase as urban areas increase in the future. When impervious ratios change from 3% (1988) to 31% (2018), the mean annual runoff would increase slightly and the annual runoff in the dry year would increase more than that in the wet year. The daily peak discharge of eight selected floods would increase from 2.3% to 13.9%. The change trend of flood volumes is similar with that of peak discharge, but with larger percentage changes than that of daily peak flows in all scenarios. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the potential changes in peak discharge and flood volume with increasing impervious surface showed a linear relationship, and the changes of small floods were larger than those of large floods with the same impervious increase, indicating that the small floods were more sensitive than large floods to urbanization. These results suggest that integrating distributed land use change model and distributed hydrological model can be a good approach to evaluate the hydrologic impacts of urbanization, which are essential for watershed management, water resources planning, and flood management for sustainable development.

AB A method for calculating groundwater discharge through a streambed on a sub-reach to a reach scale has been developed using data from plan-view mapping of streambed temperatures at a uniform depth along a reach of a river or stream. An analytical solution of the one-dimensional steady-state heat-diffusion-advection equation was used to determine fluxes from observed temperature data. The method was applied to point measurements of streambed temperatures used to map a 60 m tong reach of a river by Conant Jr. [Conant Jr. B., 2004. Delineating and quantifying ground water discharge zones using streambed temperatures. Ground Water 42(2), 243-257] and relies on the underlying assumption that streambed temperatures are in a quasi-steady-state during the period of mapping. The analytical method was able to match the values and pattern of flux previously obtained using an empirical, relationship that related streambed temperatures to fluxes obtained from piezometers and using Darcy's taw. A second independent test of the analytical method using temperature mapping and seepage meter fluxes along a first-order stream confirmed the validity of the approach. The USGS numerical. heat transport model VS2DH was also used to evaluate the thermal. response of the streambed sediments to transient variations in surface water temperatures and showed that quasi-steady-state conditions occurred for most, but not all, conditions. During mapping events in the winter, quasi-steady-state conditions were typically observed for both high and tow groundwater discharge conditions, but during summer mapping events quasi-steady-state conditions were typically not achieved at low flux areas or where measurements were made at shallow depths. Major advantages of using this analytical method include: it can be implemented using a spreadsheet; it does not require the installation or testing of piezometers or seepage meters (although they would help to confirm the results); and it needs only a minimal amount of input data related to water temperatures and the thermal properties of water and the sediments. The field results showed the analytical solution tends to underestimate high fluxes. However, a sensitivity analysis of possible model inputs shows the solution is relatively robust and not particularly sensitive to small uncertainties in input data and can produce reasonable flux estimates without the need for calibration.

AB The modeling of seasonal ground ice (SGI) freeze/thaw a common feature in boreal peatlands, has often been completed using a unidirectional approach, where melting is driven by energy inputs from the surface. However, bi-directional melt is known to occur, and can potentially increase the spring melt rate. Accurate modelling of the timing of ice-free conditions in peatlands is important because SGI can impede spring infiltration and lead to substantial spring snowmelt runoff from peatlands. However, when modelling melt only from above, erroneous results in the model estimation of ice-free conditions can occur, which can lead to knock on-effects for modelling peatland hydrological function. Furthermore, as the climate warms, it is unclear how this role of SGI may change in the future. This study used the Stefan Equation to model unidirectional and bi-directional melt to assess which performed better in modelling the timing of ice-free conditions compared to observed values (BI: 3.9 +/- 2.1 days, UNI: 9.0 +/- 4.7). Including bi-directional melt improved model performance by reducing this difference by approximately 5 days. Model performance for SGI freeze/thaw cycles were similar, with BI being slightly more accurate in freezing (RMSE:2.7 cm versus 3.3 cm) and melting (RMSE: 2.6 cm vs 3.7 cm) compared to the unidirectional approach. While the model improvement in the timing of ice-free conditions was substantial, careful consideration is needed in determining when a peatland is functionally ice free in future modelling studies. The Stefan Equation was found to be most sensitive to changes in soil moisture, compared to ground surface temperature and peat porosity, likely due to the relationship between thermal conductivity and frozen and liquid water content. Comparisons with future climate change projections suggest that the timing of ice-free conditions 'could shift by as much as 2 weeks earlier in the 2050's and by almost a month earlier in the 2080's. However, the timing of snowfall, and rain on snow events continues to be a source of model uncertainty. Future studies should work to investigate the potential positive feedbacks this could create. In conclusion, the Stefan Equation presents a relatively easy path for incorporating bi-directional melt into peatland models. This process should be included in peatland ecohydrological models in order to properly model the timing of melt and ice-free conditions.

ID RADIATION
AB In studies of the potential effects of global climate change on freshwater ecosystems, water temperature is a primary factor. Linear regressions of stream temperature versus air temperature are attractive for this purpose, because they require only one input variable (air temperature) which can be simulated by General Circulation Models (GCMs) better than other climate variables. Under a warmer climate scenario, high stream temperatures must be projected by extrapolation. The question arises whether linear extrapolation is valid.
   To answer the question, the heat exchange processes that contribute to surface water temperature have been analyzed and related to air temperature on a weekly time scale. The equilibrium temperature concept introduced by Edinger has been used. In stream reaches with large drainage area, stream temperature can be approximated by equilibrium temperature. At elevated air temperatures, the vapor pressure deficit above a water surface increases drastically (even in humid regions) causing strong evaporative cooling and hence a flatter stream temperature/air temperature relationship. At low air temperatures, stream temperatures often reach 0 degrees C as an asymptote. If an upstream flow control (dam, reservoir release) or a waste heat input is present, the lower asymptotic value can be larger than 0 degrees C. As a result of these upper and lower constraints for stream temperatures, the stream temperature/air temperature relationship resembles an S-shaped function rather than a straight line. Linear extrapolations to high and low air temperatures are therefore not justified. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multi-isotopes approach involving the use of stable nitrate isotopes (delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3)) combined with stable water isotopes (delta O-18(H2O) and delta H-2(H2O)) as tracers can help identify the nitrogen source and understand the transformation process in a river water system. In this study, we identify the potential impact of the N source in the effluent discharged from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) on the surrounding stream and clarified the seasonal variations in the isotope values of the effluent and stream water from 2019 to 2020 in South Korea. In addition, we investigate the factors that led to the seasonal variations of the stable isotopes and evaluated the relationship between the uncertainty of the contribution ratio of the N sources and isotopic variations in the river water system. To examine the potential impact of the inputs of N from the WWTP, samples were obtained from the stream (up and down with respect to the WWTP) and WWTP (influent and treated effluent) once a month. For the monthly effluent samples, delta O-18(H2O) and delta H-2(H2O) ranged from -9.37 parts per thousand to -8.68 parts per thousand and from -65.29 parts per thousand to -59.37 parts per thousand, respectively, exhibiting isotopic depletion in wet season and enrichment in dry season. Moreover, in the effluent, delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3) ranged from 10.56 parts per thousand to 16.60 parts per thousand and -4.86 parts per thousand to -0.35 parts per thousand, respectively. To clarify the seasonal variation in the effluent, high-resolution samples of the influent and treated effluent were obtained every day in September 2019. It is noted that delta N-15(NO3) in the effluent was influenced by the N source instead of the seasonal variation, although delta O-18(NO3) exhibited a high dependence on the seasonal effects, influenced by delta O-18(H2O). When estimating the contribution of the effluent using isotope values to the water system, uncertainty could arise due to these seasonal variations. Overall, a multi-isotope approach involving the combined use of stable nitrate isotopes (delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO3)) and stable water isotopes (delta O-18(H2O) and delta H-2(H2O)) as tracers can help evaluate the potential impact of N sources on water systems.

AB Monitoring changes in flood extent is critical for flood control and mitigation purposes in areas where flooding affects many people and dense infrastructure and properties. Remote sensing can be an effective technique to detect changes in surface water extent and its dynamics. Compared to optical remote sensing, microwave in- formation is suitable for working in any weather condition without severe cloud interference. Usually passive microwave data has a high temporal but a rather coarse spatial resolution, whereas for active microwave data this is reversed and only with ideal satellite constellation observations it can reach high sampling rates. To overcome these spatial and temporal restrictions, we proposed an integrated methodology to combine the passive and active microwave remote sensing and thus provide flood information more frequently at a high resolution. In this paper, a demonstration of the methodology is presented for a flood event occurring in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in July 2016. The major inundation occurred along the Jushui River, part of the Middle Yangtze River basin. Using the brightness temperature data from a special data set (MEaSUREs), a daily passive microwave signal at the resolution of 3.125 km is used as an indicator to monitor flood occurrence and obtain the flood duration over time. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery (12-day revisit, 10-m spatial resolution) from Sentinel-1 was processed to estimate high resolution flood extents within the time span of the flood based on a threshold-based method together with the High Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) index post-processor. Surface water fraction data generated from SAR images presents a strong correlation with the passive microwave signal (R-2 = 0.84) when using a quadratic polynomial fit. The average bias between surface water fraction computed by the passive microwave signals and SAR observations for water pixels within the Jushui River basin for the validation dates is 0.34%, indicating that this relationship can be applied to interpolate surface water fraction for each pixel along the river and other permanent water bodies for days when SAR observations are not available. This integrated method takes advantage of both passive and active microwave remote sensing and enriches temporally sparse flood data. Given the global coverage of the datasets used in this study, it can be utilized to estimate flood status for other flood-prone areas and thus contribute towards societal flood preparedness and response.

AB Streamflow time series provide baseline data for many hydrological investigations. Errors in the data mainly occur through uncertainty in gauging (measurement uncertainty) and uncertainty in the determination of the stage-discharge relationship based on gaugings (rating curve uncertainty). As the velocity area method is the measurement technique typically used for gaugings, it is fundamental to estimate its level of uncertainty. Different methods are available in the literature (ISO 748, Q+, IVE), all with their own limitations and drawbacks. Among the terms forming the combined relative uncertainty in measured discharge, the uncertainty component relating to the limited number of verticals often includes a large part of the relative uncertainty. It should therefore be estimated carefully. In ISO 748 standard, proposed values of this uncertainty component only depend on the number of verticals without considering their distribution with respect to the depth and velocity cross-sectional profiles. The Q+ method is sensitive to a user-defined parameter while it is questionable whether the IVE method is applicable to stream-gaugings performed with a limited number of verticals. To address the limitations of existing methods, this paper presents a new methodology, called FLow Analog UnceRtainty Estimation (Fume), to estimate the uncertainty component relating to the limited number of verticals. High-resolution reference gaugings (with 31 and more verticals) are used to assess the uncertainty component through a statistical analysis. Instead of subsampling purely randomly the verticals of these reference stream-gaugings, a subsampling method is developed in a way that mimicks the behavior of a hydrometric technician. A sampling quality index (SQI) is suggested and appears to be a more explanatory variable than the number of verticals. This index takes into account the spacing between verticals and the variation of unit flow between two verticals. To compute the uncertainty component for any routine gauging, the four most similar gaugings among the reference stream-gaugings dataset are selected using an analog approach, where analogy includes both riverbed shape and flow distribution complexity. This new method was applied to 3185 stream-gaugings with various flow conditions and compared with the other methods (ISO 748, IVE, with a simple automated parametrization). Results show that FLAME is overall consistent with the Q+ method but not with ISO 748 and NE methods, which produce clearly overestimated uncertainties for discharge measurements with less than 15 verticals. The FLAURE approach therefore appears to be a consistent method. An advantage is the explicit link made between the estimation of cross-sectional interpolation errors and the study of high-resolution reference gaugings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A method for simultaneous estimation of groundwater evapotranspiration

AB As an indispensable component of groundwater circulation, groundwater evapotranspiration rate (ETG) estimation using water table fluctuations is a hot research topic in the past decades. However, most existing methods for estimating ETG using either diurnal or seasonal water table fluctuations are based on the assumptions that groundwater recharge equals 0 in the whole period and ETG equals 0 in a specific duration of time. The aim of the current study is to develop a method to estimate ETc when both assumptions do not apply. In the discharge area of a semi-arid catchment in the Ordos Plateau, NW China, it is found out that the water table fluctuations are influenced greatly by recharge, ETG and the vertical inflow rate (q(in)) in the seasonal scale but are controlled by atmospheric pressure instead of evapotranspiration in the diurnal scale, which implies that the existing methods are not applicable. Therefore, we propose a method to estimate ETG and q(in) using the seasonal water table fluctuations based on the assumptions that IN is stable throughout the year and ETG has a linear relationship to the reference evapotranspiration (ET0). It is found out that q(in), is around 1.12 mm/d, and the ratio of ETG to ET0 is around 0.4. ET0 in April through July with the highest ET0 of the year is found to be around 3 mm/d, which is much larger than qin, thus leads to significant decline in water table. ETG in November with the lowest ET0 of the unfrozen period is found to be 1.0 mm/d, which is slightly smaller than q(in), thus results in a weak increase in water table. The vertical component of regional groundwater inflow is found to exceed precipitation recharge, indicating that regional groundwater inflow plays the major role on maintaining the shallow water table in the discharge area. Groundwater evapotranspiration is also found to exceed precipitation recharge in most time of the unfrozen period, indicating a specified-flux upper boundary with water loss in the discharge area of an arid catchment. The proposed method could be applied to similar study areas and is critical to understand the budget of groundwater. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Our work on the Loire River forms part of a French National Research Program dedicated to wetlands and aims to better understand the global functioning of the system from the hydrological, geochemical, ecological and sociological aspects. The present study, using a coupled hydrological and geochemical (stable and Sr isotopes) approach, focuses on the `Soulangy' site with its secondary anastomosing channels just below the confluence of the Loire and Allier rivers, and also on the `Dorna"nt' site with two unconnected oxbow lakes 50 km upstream of the confluence. The stable isotopes of water (delta(18)O, delta(2)H) show that the alluvial (or riverbank) aquifer feeds the Loire River during the summer, but is not recharged by the river during flood periods in the winter; the alluvial groundwater thus' has a purely local origin from precipitation. The major elements reveal an anthropogenic input of Cl and more importantly of NO3, especially near farms. The Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopes identify different groundwater layers in the alluvium, i.e. an upper and a lower alluvial aquifer, and a perched aquifer at Dornant, that have relatively complex relationships with the surface water. The two main rivers (Loire and Allier) present distinct geochemical characteristics reflecting the different lithologies that they drain upstream. In addition, the secondary channels, lying parallel to the Loire main stream at the Soulangy site, give different geochemical signatures, which shows that they are not fed by the same overflows of the Loire, they are more-or-less well connected to the upper level of the alluvial plain, and a longitudinal study of one of these channels has revealed a Loire River influence progressively replaced by a water contribution from the upper alluvial aquifer: Similarly, the two oxbow lakes at the Dornant site are not. supplied by the same water during the summer months. A conceptual scheme of the Loire hydrosystem based on delta(18)O and 87Sr/86Sr suggests that the isotopic variations of the Loire River can be related to a Massif Central surface-water supply for the Loire and Allier main streams and to a groundwater supply from the alluvial plains.

AB Partitioning evapotranspiration (ET') into evaporation (E') and plant transpiration (T') is key to understanding ecosystem responses to rainfall variability resulting from climate change. The goal of this study was to quantify T and E using eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements in a tallgrass prairie in consecutive growing seasons with contrasting rainfall regimes. The field measurements were conducted at the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) KONZ site, in Kansas, U.S., during the growing seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019. The ET partitioning was performed using an approach based on the concept of the underlying water use efficiency (uWUE). To evaluate the uWUE approach, we compared daily E estimates obtained from the uWUE with E observations provided by microlysimeters (ML). Green chromatic coordinate (GCC) was used to monitor the vegetation dynamics. In the 2017 growing season, the total rainfall was 23.1% below the site's long-term average cumulative precipitation. On the other hand, in 2018 and 2019 the accumulated growing season precipitations were 7.2% and 40.2%, respectively, above the long-term precipitation average. The relationship between uWUE approach and ML E measurements showed a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.42 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.58 mm d(-1). The lowest T/ET average value (0.50) was observed in the 2017 growing season, while the largest T/ET average (0.65) was observed in 2018. The correlations between GCC and T/ET were reduced during the growing seasons that experienced drought periods. Air temperature was the main environmental driver of T/ET during the wet growing seasons (r = 0.49 and 0.72). The subsurface soil moisture (0.45 m) was the main environmental driver of T/ET during a dry growing season (r = 0.41). These results demonstrate that the precipitation variability not only has a direct impact on the ET components but also modulates the response of those components to other environmental drivers. Since ET partitioning studies at the ecosystem scale are still scarce, our results can improve T/ET and water use efficiency estimates in long-term modelling studies. This will help to better understand how ET in ecosystems will respond to global warming and increased CO2 concentration during wet and dry growing seasons.

AB Long-term forecasting of any hydrologic phenomena is essential for strategic environmental planning, hydrologic and other forms of structural design, agriculture, and water resources management. Climate mode indices, utilising machine learning methods, are frequently considered as predictor variables in order to forecast several different hydrological variables. In this study, a feature selection algorithm based on two different deep learning models, i.e., long short-term memory and a gated recurrent unit, is applied to improve the forecasting capability of streamflow water levels at six gauging stations in the Murray Darling Basin of Australia. This paper therefore aggregates the significant antecedent lag memory of climate mode indices, rainfall, and the monthly factor based on the periodicity as the predictor variables to attain significantly accurate stream water level forecasts. This novel method identifies an improved relationship between the stream water level and climate mode indices through the aggregation of the significant lagged datasets capturing the historical features to predict the future streamflow water level. The boruta feature selection algorithm (BRF) was then applied in a two phase process before and after attaining the significant lagged inputs to screen the optimum predictor variables. The merits of the forecast models were evaluated through different performance evaluation criteria. The results show that the accumulated significant lagged inputs based on climate mode indices, along with the rainfall and periodicity factors are seen to provide improved forecasting of the SWL over the non-BRF deep learning approaches where no prior feature selection was applied. The hybrid LSTM method (i.e., BRF-LSTM model) achieved a unique advantage in terms of SWL forecasting, particularly attaining over 98% of the predictive errors lying within a band of +/-0.015 m with relatively low relative errors (RRMSE approximate to 1.30% and RMAE approximate to 0.882%), outperforming all of the benchmark models. It is also found that the periodicity factor has a potential influence on the accuracy of the forecast models for the four monitored study stations. This study concludes that the newly developed hybrid deep learning approaches, coupled with the BRF feature selection, provide improved forecasting performance. The hybrid approach developed in this paper can therefore be used to provide a strong provide predictive response algorithm for the hydrological variables that were influenced by the low-frequency variability of the climate model indices in respect to streamflow water level.

AB Water diversion has been applied increasingly to promote the exchange of lake water and to control eutrophication of lakes. The accelerated water exchange and mass transport by water diversion can usually be represented by water age. But the responses of water quality after water diversion is still disputed. The reliability of using water age for evaluating the effectiveness of water diversion projects in eutrophic lakes should be thereby explored further. Lake Dianchi, a semi-closed plateau lake in China, has suffered severe eutrophication since the 1980s, and it is one of the three most eutrophic lakes in China. There was no significant improvement in water quality after an investment of approximately 7.7 billion USD and numerous project efforts from 1996 to 2015. After the approval of the Chinese State Council, water has been transferred to Lake Dianchi to alleviate eutrophication since December 2013. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model and eight scenarios were developed in this study to quantity the influence of this water diversion project on water quality in Lake Dianchi. The model results showed that (a) Water quality (TP, TN, and Chla) could be improved by 13.5-32.2%, much lower than the approximate 50% reduction in water age; (b) Water exchange had a strong positive relationship with mean TP, and mean Chla had exactly the same response to water diversion as mean TN; (c) Water level was more beneficial for improving hydrodynamic and nutrient concentrations than variation in the diverted inflowing water volume; (d) The water diversion scenario of doubling the diverted inflow rate in the wet season with the water level of 1886.5 m and 1887 m in the remaining months was the best water diversion mode for mean hydrodynamics and TP, but the scenario of doubling the diverted inflow rate in the wet season with 1887 m throughout the year was optimum for mean TN and Chla; (e) Water age influenced the effectiveness of water diversion on the improvement in TP, but not in TN and Chla. Therefore, water age solely could not be used to evaluate the restoration of water quality in a eutrophic lake, because geobiochemical processes played a more important role in the growth of algae than did water exchange in Lake Dianchi.

AB Human influence on the hydrologic cycle includes regulation and storage, consumptive use and overall redistribution of water resources in space and time. Representing these processes is essential for applications of earth system models in hydrologic and climate predictions, as well as impact studies at regional to global scales. Emerging large-scale research reservoir models use generic operating rules that are flexible for coupling with earth system models. Those generic operating rules have been successful in reproducing the overall regulated flow at large basin scales. This study investigates the uncertainties of the reservoir models from different implementations of the generic operating rules using the complex multi-objective Columbia River Regulation System in northwestern United States as an example to understand their effects on not only regulated flow but also reservoir storage and fraction of the demand that is met. Numerical experiments are designed to test new generic operating rules that combine storage and releases targets for multipurpose reservoirs and to compare the use of reservoir usage priorities and predictors (withdrawals vs. consumptive demands, as well as natural vs. regulated mean flow) for configuring operating rules. Overall the best performing implementation is with combined priorities rules (flood control storage targets and irrigation release targets) set up with mean annual natural flow and mean monthly withdrawals. The options of not accounting for groundwater withdrawals, or on the contrary, of assuming that all remaining demand is met through groundwater extractions, are discussed.

AB In the dispersion theory, a linear relationship has been verified between the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion and water velocity, both in saturated and in unsaturated porous media. But for unsaturated soils the variability of flow directions and microscopic velocities can be larger than in saturated soils because of the lower degree of water saturation. This leads to an increased dispersion. Therefore, relationships between water content and relative water velocity fluctuations and water content together with the coefficient of dispersivity in unsaturated porous media respectively have been investigated systematically by displacement experiments in glass beads and coarse-textured sandy soil columns. The breakthrough curves (BTCs) of chloride showed that an increase of solute mixing with a decrease of water content was caused by an increase of flow velocity fluctuations for different pathways. In order to explain the observed tailing effect in unsaturated flow, two mathematical models were used to fit theoretically derived nonlinear functions of water content dependent dispersivities for both porous media. The close agreement between the observed and computed results suggests that the theoretical model of hydrodynamic dispersion can be extended to transport in unsaturated porous media, providing that BTCs of the effluent water are used to estimate representative dispersivity parameters of soils.

AB In this study, we have analyzed the productivity of a grassland ecosystem in Khertenbayan-Ulaan (KBU), Mongolia under non-grazing and grazing conditions using a new simulation model, Sim-CYCLE grazing. The model was obtained by integrating the Sim-CYCLE [Ito, A., Oikawa, T., 2002. A simulation model of carbon cycle in land ecosystems (Sim-CYCLE): a description based on dry-matter production theory and plot-scate validation. Ecological Modeling, 151, pp. 143-176] and a defoliation formulation [Seligman, N.G., Cavagnaro, J.B., Horno, M.E., 1992. Simulation of defohation effects on primary production of warm-season, semiarid perennial-species grassland. Ecological Modelling, 60, pp. 45-61]. The results from the model have been validated against a set of field data obtained at KBU showing that both above-ground biomass (AB) and above-ground net primary production (N,a) decrease with increasing grazing intensity. The simulated maximum AB for a year maintains a nearly constant value of 1.15 Mg DM ha(-1) under non-grazing conditions. The AB decreases and then reaches equilibrium under a stocking rate (S-r) of 0.4 sheep ha(-1) and 0.7 sheep ha(-1). The AB decreases all. the time if Sr is greater than 0.7 sheep ha(-1). These results suggest that the maximum sustainable Sr is 0.7 sheep ha(-1). A similar trend is also observed for the simulated N-p,N-a. The annual Np,a is about 1.25 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1) and this value is also constant under non-grazing conditions. The annual N-p,N-a decreases and then reaches equilibrium under an Sr of 0.4 sheep ha(-1) and 0.7 sheep ha(-1), but the N-p,N-a decreases all the time when Sr is greater than 0.7 sheep ha(-1). It also indicates that the maximum sustainable S-r is 0.7 sheep ha(-1). Transpiration (E-T) and evaporation (E-E) rates were determined by the Penman-Monteith method. Simulated results show that E-T decreases with increasing S-r, while E-E increases with increasing S-r. At equilibrium, the annual mean evapotranspiration (E) is 189.11 mm year(-1) under non-grazing conditions and 187.46 mm year(-1) under an Sr of 0.7 sheep ha(-1). This indicates that the water budget of the KBU grassland ecosystem is not significantly affected by grazing. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Liquid reinfiltration is a significant process, which can considerably retard and slowdown the transport of oil, water and contaminants in fractured subsurface formations. However, accurate modeling of the reinfiltration via liquid bridges formed in a horizontal fracture or space between two rock porous blocks remains a controversial topic. In an attempt to improve an understanding of the problem, the reinfiltration from upper to lower matrix blocks through formation of liquid bridges is theoretically modeled by using generalization of the Lucas-Washburn theory for a porous medium, which takes into account pressure differences due to matrix capillary, gravity, inertia, viscous, and fracture capillary forces. The developed model results in a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), which is solved numerically to obtain depth and rate of the reinfiltrated liquid versus time. The results showed that three reinfiltration regimes: including Early Time Regime (ETR) (z similar to t, q = constant), Middle Time Regime (MTR) (z similar to root t, q similar to 1/root t) and Late Time Regime (LTR) (z similar to t, q = constant) can be observed, where the inertia, viscous, and gravity forces are dominant, respectively. The results also indicated that by increasing the permeability of the porous medium, the durations of the ETR (z similar to t, q = constant) and the LTR (z similar to t, q = constant) are prolonged while the duration of the MTR (z similar to root t, q similar to 1/root t) is reduced. Moreover, the results revealed that by increasing the liquid viscosity, the durations of the ETR (z similar to t, q = constant) and LTR (z similar to t, q = constant) are reduced whereas the duration of the MTR (z similar to root t, q similar to 1 root t) is prolonged. In addition, the results showed that in the case of high permeability of the porous medium when the fracture capillary pressure is strong enough only the LTR (z similar to t, q = constant) can be observed. The MTR (z similar to root t, q similar to 1 root t) and the LTR (z similar to t, q = constant) scalings are of practical significance since the liquid reinfiltration in fractured rocks associated with gas-liquid drainage mechanism is a very slow process. These findings advance the understanding of the two-phase flow in fractured porous media. (C) 2014 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrological models have been widely used to predict runoff in regions with observed discharge data, and regionalization methods have been extensively discussed for providing runoff predictions in ungauged basins (PUB), especially during the PUB decade (2003-2012). Great progress has been achieved in the field of regionalization in previous studies, in which different hydrological models have been coupled with various regionalization methods. However, different conclusions have been drawn due to the use of different hydrological models, regionalization methods, and study regions. In this study, we assessed the performance of the five most widely used regionalization methods (spatial proximity with parameter averaging option (SP-par), spatial proximity with output averaging option (SP-out), physical similarity with parameter averaging option (Phy-par), physical similarity with output averaging option (Phy-out), and regression methods (PCR)) and four daily rainfall-runoff models (GR4J, WASMOD, HBV and XAJ, with 6, 8, 13, and 17 parameters, respectively) at the same time. Our aim was to evaluate how the performance of the regionalization methods depends on (a) the selection of hydrological models, (b) nonstationary climate conditions, and (c) different climatic regions. This investigation used data from 86 independent catchments evenly distributed throughout Norway, covering three different climate zones (oceanic, continental and polar tundra) according to the Koppen-Geiger classification. The results showed that (a) the SP-out and Phy-out methods performed better than the SP-par and Phy-par for all the hydrological models, and the regression method performed worst in most cases; (b) the difference between the parameter averaging option and the output averaging option is positively related to the number of hydrological model parameters, i.e. the greater the number of parameters, the larger the difference between the two options; (c) the XAJ model with the greatest number of parameters produced the best results in most cases, and models with fewer parameters tend to produce similar performance for the different regionalization methods; (d) models with more parameters displayed larger declines in performance than those with fewer parameters for nonstationary conditions; and (e) clear differences in the performance of the regionalization methods exist among the three climatic regions. This study provides insight into the relationship between the complexity of hydrological models and regionalization methods in cold and seasonally snow-covered regions.

AB Climate change is expected to have a profound influence on soil moisture. According to that the present study aimed at the investigation of future soil water evolution by considering the relationship between soil moisture changes resulting from climate change projections, soil, and terrain characteristics, with special emphasis on slope and groundwater depth. The distributed hydrological model WaSiM-ETH was used to simulate root zone soil water content at a 1 km grid resolution in the 1700 km(2) Thur river basin (NE Switzerland) during the 6-month period from April to September. The model was driven by baseline climate data from national data records for 1981-2000, or by scenario data for 2081-2100. The latter were based on grid point projections of two global climate models (CSIRO [132] and HaclCM3 [A2]). The datasets were completed with observations and simulations for the exceptionalty warm and dry summer of 2003. The results suggested that a warmer climate with less summertime precipitation may significantly lower the seasonal mean soil water content in many parts of this basin, leading to frequent water stress conditions. Strongest effects occurred with HadCM3, and to a similar extent with 2003 weather data. The magnitude of soil moisture changes were related to [and use, soil texture, and slope. In relative terms, reductions in soil water were largest for sloping soils with low water storage capacity, and also larger for forests than for cropland and grasslands. In absolute (votumetric) units, most pronounced reductions were indicated for flat areas with good water supply (mostly dominated by cropland). Here, the rooting zone was often connected to the groundwater, and capillary rise counteracted soil water depletion under current climate during the first half of the season, but was disconnected much earlier under climate change conditions. In steeper areas, groundwater had no influence and thus soil water content changed mainly in response to decreased precipitation and increased evapotranspiration. It is concluded that soil water contents generally decline in this pre-alpine river basin with climate change, but that the degree of soil water depletion varies with climate scenario, land use, soil texture, and topographic conditions. Thus, realistic soil water projections require reliable predictions of summertime climate, and the use of a full representation of biophysical processes that control evapotranspiration, including vertical and lateral subsurface water flows.

AB Recent studies of catchment hydrologic response are incorporating increasingly complex datasets to investigate model representation of spatial and temporal variability. In this paper, catchment rainfall-runoff and stable isotope tracer response were modeled using a lumped conceptual model that integrates the unit hydrograph and isotope hydrograph separation methodologies. The model was applied across eight nested catchments (7 to 147 ha) for four rainstorms collected between summer and fall in 2001-2002, generating a usable 23 rainstorm datasets ranging from 1.2 to 10.3 h in length and spanning variability in environmental conditions related to storm characteristics (size and intensity) and antecedent moisture. Monte Carlo simulations were run for four model structures of varying complexity and evaluated using a Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach. We found that a model of intermediate complexity was adequate to model all catchment-storm pairs. Relationships between the parameters of the best model and catchment and storm characteristics were sought. We found that the fraction of effective rainfall routed as event water was correlated to rainstorm size but insensitive to catchment size, indicating that it is controlled by environmental conditions such as storm intensity and size. The mean transit time of event water decreased with increasing rainstorm size, indicating increased connectivity during larger rainstorms. Finally, a linear relation was found between the mean transit time of event water and catchment size suggesting that the time it takes for event water to be transferred to the stream is directly related to catchment size, particularly for catchments greater than 30 ha.

AB Simulation approaches employed in sediment processes are important for watershed management and environmental impact assessment. Use of Stochastic models that based on time series observations and do not require heavy calculations and complex relationships is developing. Recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have developed to improve the accuracy of sediment modeling.
   In this review study, the performances of the various types of AI models viz., ANN, GP, GEP, ANFIS, SVM, IBL, ABC, REPT, TLBO, decision tree and hybrid models viz., wavelet-AI, GP-AI are investigated as a means of prediction of sediment patterns in rivers. Published between 2001 and 2019, the 66 papers comprising the study deal with the usage of AI models in estimate of sediment and are undertaken in terms of data selection, modeling approaches, prediction time step, and modeling performance evaluation. This study presents an overview of AI techniques and a discussion of advantages to and applications of modeling sediment relations which to some extent have replaced time-consuming conventional mathematical techniques. However, the study discusses major challenges and prospective research opportunities. Comparison of the results produced by the models indicated an improvement in the prediction accuracy through the use of hybrid models. The most prominent feature of hybrid models is that they can provide more precise predictions for extremely high or low values, due to the utilization of the distributed information processing system and the non-linear transform involved. In the most recent articles in competition with wavelets an iterative procedure namely HHT introduced as effective filter for extracting the oscillatory-like features at different time scales. A review of published articles on sediment modeling showed the emergence of wavelet-based methods since 2008. No wavelet-AI based methods have been used in any of the articles reviewed so far. This subject was not investigated by any study in 2009. Between 2010 and 2019, 12 papers explored the use of a number of wavelet-AI based methods. About 19 percent (13 papers) of the studies used hybrid wavelet models among the articles studied. Of all the papers, only 6 papers investigated the performance of the models for the detection of hysteresis phenomenon. This study showed that AI models could be successfully employed to simulate the complex river sediment process in situations where explicit knowledge of internal sub-process is not required. This study also presents several new thinking in the related field of research to develop innovative methods and improve the quality of modeling. Future research efforts should be focused on formulating guidelines that help to develop AI-based models.

AB Developing accurate and reliable pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) to predict soil non-readily available characteristics is one of the most concerned topic in soil science and selecting more appropriate predictors is a crucial factor in PTFs' development. Group method of data handling (GMDH), which finds an approximate relationship between a set of input and output variables, not only provide an explicit procedure to select the most essential PTF input variables, but also results in more accurate and reliable estimates than other mostly applied methodologies. Therefore, the current research was aimed to apply GMDH in comparison with multivariate linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) to develop several PTFs to predict soil cumulative infiltration point-basely at specific time intervals (0.5-45 min) using soil readily available characteristics (RACs). In this regard, soil infiltration curves as well as several soil RACs including soil primary particles (clay (CC), silt (Si), and sand (Sa)), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), bulk (D-b) and particle (D-p) densities, organic carbon (OC), wet-aggregate stability (WAS), electrical conductivity (EC), and soil antecedent (theta(i)) and field saturated (theta(fs)) water contents were measured at 134 different points in Lighvan watershed, northwest of Iran. Then, applying GMDH, MLR, and ANN methodologies, several PTFs have been developed to predict cumulative infiltrations using two sets of selected soil RACs including and excluding K-s. According to the test data, results showed that developed PTFs by GMDH and MLR procedures using all soil RACs including K-s resulted in more accurate (with E values of 0.673-0.963) and reliable (with CV values lower than 11 percent) predictions of cumulative infiltrations at different specific time steps. In contrast, ANN procedure had lower accuracy (with E values of 0.356-0.890) and reliability (with CV values up to 50 percent) compared to GMDH-and MLR. The results also revealed that K-s exclusion from input variables list caused around 30 percent decrease in PTFs accuracy for all applied procedures. However, it seems that K-s exclusion resulted in more practical PTFs especially in the case of GMDH network applying input variables which are less time consuming than K-s. In general, it is concluded that GMDH provides more accurate and reliable estimates of cumulative infiltration (a non-readily available characteristic of soil) with a minimum set of input variables (2-4 input variables) and can be promising strategy to model soil infiltration combining the advantages of ANN and MLR methodologies.

AB Important features of multiphase flow in porous media that distinguish it from single-phase flow are the presence of interfaces between the fluid phases and of common lines where three phases come in contact. Despite this fact, mathematical descriptions of these flows have been lacking in rigor, consisting primarily of heuristic extensions of Darcy's law that include a hysteretic relation between capillary pressure and saturation and a relative permeability coefficient. As a result, the standard capillary pressure concept appears to have physically unrealistic properties. The present paper employs microscopic mass and momentum balance equations for phases and interfaces to develop an understanding of capillary pressure at the microscale. Next, the standard theories and approaches that define capillary pressure at the macroscale are described and their shortcomings are discussed. Finally, an approach is presented whereby capillary pressure is shown to be an intrinsic property of the system under study. In particular, the presence of interfaces and their distribution within a multiphase system are shown to be essential to describing the state of the system. A thermodynamic approach to the definition of capillary pressure provides a theoretically sound alternative to the definition of capillary pressure as a simple hysteretic function of saturation.

AB The Fertile Crescent (FC) region comprises the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The FC suffered two severe drought episodes separated by a 7-year period, in 1998-2000 and 2007-2009, which are considered the most severe episodes to hit the region in the last 50 years. A Lagrangian model (FLEXPART) and ERA-Interim data (with a 1 degrees x 1 degrees lat-long resolution) were used to identify for the first time the climatological sources of moisture for the FC and their characteristics. Variability and the source-receptor relationships, concerning their contribution to the precipitation, and the implications regarding the transport of moisture changes over the FC, during the wet season (October-May) from 1980 to 2014 were analysed. The main climatological moisture sources during this period were determined to be the FC itself, the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the central and western parts of the Mediterranean Sea.
   The analysis showed higher anomalous conditions in the moisture transport from some moisture sources during the two outstanding drought episodes. The key feature of the wet seasons during these episodes was a deficit in the moisture losses over the studied area related to the FC itself, the Red and Arabian Seas sources, followed and to a lesser extent by the eastern Mediterranean Sea over the northern part of the FC region. Nevertheless, the moisture supply deficit from the sources was much greater during the 2007-2009 drought event. The SPEI index at large scales (24 months) showed that the 2007-2009 episode was part of longer-term drought conditions that had been developing over the previous months, reinforcing the drought severity given recycling processes attributed to the FC. During the two extreme drought episodes, the mountainous terrain over the northern and eastern FC suffered the highest precipitation deficits, and these areas are, precisely, the most influenced by two of the major moisture sources, namely, the FC and eastern Mediterranean Sea. The decreased moisture contribution from these main sources led to more intense droughts over the region. As a result, both regions should be considered as hotspots to signal severe or extreme droughts in the region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical peat swamp forests (PSFs) play a significant role in the exchange of water between land and the atmosphere. However, fire and drainage have been expanding in PSFs in recent decades. Although there is concern on the influence of fire and drainage on water circulation, their influence on evapotranspiration (ET) is insufficiently understood. Furthermore, repeated fire occurrences and their corresponding influence on the ET by recurrent burning and smoldering is unexplored. To elucidate these influences, we examined long-term variation of ET in a degraded peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia that was affected by drainage and repeated fire. The continuous observation of energy fluxes was conducted for approximately 13 years between 2004 and 2016 by using the eddy covariance technique. The site burned in 2009 and 2014, and was drained in 2014. Monthly ET and net radiation (R-n) fluctuated in synchrony and thus they decreased considerably under fire-induced dense haze during the El Nino drought. Troughs of ET, groundwater level (GWL) and R-n and crests of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) coincided in their time-series variations. In the case of ET > precipitation (P), ET decreased when the GWL was deeper than -0.5 m. Half-hourly ET had a strong positive correlation with R-n (R = 0.89, p < 0.01), and partial positive relationship with VPD when VPD < 20 hPa and with GWL when GWL < -0.5 m. ET had no correlation with the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which represents above ground biomass for the entire observation period. Alternately, the results of path analysis showed that some environmental factors controlled ET differently depending on environmental conditions. Generally, VPD negatively affected ET due to stomatal regulation functions under dry atmospheric conditions. However, the effect was negligible during the water-logged periods. This is because atmospheric dryness facilitated evaporation from exposed water on the ground surface, which canceled out the negative effect of transpiration due to stomatal closure. After drainage by canal excavation, fluctuation of GWL did not significantly influence ET, although ET decreased. This may be due to the hydrophobic dried peat soil, which prevents rainwater infiltration, disconnection of capillary force, or disabled root water uptake as GWL excessively deepened. Fire potentially decreased ET due to decreased transpiration by burning of vegetation. However, the decreasing effect was cancelled by increased evaporation from the waterlogged ground surface during the subsequent La Nina event. Drainage undoubtedly deepened the GWL, and ET severely decreased in cases with extremely deep GWL.

AB We investigated the applicability of sampling at mesoscale physical habitats (MPH) for water quality variation of headwater streams. Sampling was carried out for several hydro-environmental and water quality variables in a headwater stream subjected to moderate levels of anthropogenic disturbances. To compare results with the much popular conventional methods, sampling was also carried out at equal size stream sections (cell-in-series (CIS)). Data collection covered dry (low discharge) and wet (high discharge) seasons. Each season sampling was repeated for typical and flushed (less polluted) states of the stream. Relationships were evidenced primarily by redundancy analysis. Correlations between hydro-environmental and water quality variables were practically same for both approaches. Also, ordination diagrams showed a tendency of first order tributaries to separate from other samples or to form clusters. This was more obvious for the MPH approach. The ordination lengths between adjacent sampling locations in flushed states were much closer than the corresponding typical state for both approaches. The most influential (i.e., with the ability to explain high variance and/or significance) hydro-environmental variables varied on the approach. Habitat (sampling unit) dimensions (width and depth) had high influence in MPH approach; it was the substrate condition (fine particle fraction) for CIS approach. The total variance explained (i.e., explanatory power) by the respective approach seemed to depend on season and state. MPH approach showed highest explanatory power in dry season's flushed state (53%) which is greater than the CIS approach. Explanatory powers of CIS approach observed to be about 50% or more for all cases, with the exception being the flushed state in dry season (36%). This study revealed some important empirical and theoretical frameworks for MPH based assessments. Firstly, MPHs are more complementary to low flows and less polluted streams. Low flow makes MPHs assimilation and attenuation optimal, making them hotspots for water quality studies. More complementary to less polluted waters elucidate that there is a capacity a MPH can work effectively on pollutant removal. Secondly, the correlation between levels of pollution expressed as a flushing signature and sampling approach elucidate that the explanatory powers of MPH and CIS approaches could be used to differentiate polluted streams against pristine or unpolluted streams. Nevertheless, these empirical and theoretical frameworks proposed need further validation. Therefore, we recommend carrying out similar studies in different geo-environmental conditions with more replications under natural as well as controlled experimental setups. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Between 25 and 27 August 2010 a long-duration mesoscale convective system was observed above the Netherlands, locally giving rise to rainfall accumulations exceeding 150 mm. Correctly measuring the amount of precipitation during such an extreme event is important, both from a hydrological and meteorological perspective. Unfortunately, the operational weather radar measurements were affected by multiple sources of error and only 30% of the precipitation observed by rain gauges was estimated. Such an underestimation of heavy rainfall, albeit generally less strong than in this extreme case, is typical for operational weather radar in The Netherlands.
   In general weather radar measurement errors can be subdivided into two groups: (I) errors affecting the volumetric reflectivity measurements (e.g. ground clutter, radar calibration, vertical profile of reflectivity) and (2) errors resulting from variations in the raindrop size distribution that in turn result in incorrect rainfall intensity and attenuation estimates from observed reflectivity measurements. A stepwise procedure to correct for the first group of errors leads to large improvements in the quality of the estimated precipitation, increasing the radar rainfall accumulations to about 65% of those observed by gauges. To correct for the second group of errors, a coherent method is presented linking the parameters of the radar reflectivity-rain rate (Z-R) and radar reflectivity-specific attenuation (Z-k) relationships to the normalized drop size distribution (DSD). Two different procedures were applied. First, normalized DSD parameters for the whole event and for each precipitation type separately (convective, stratiform and undefined) were obtained using local disdrometer observations. Second, 10,000 randomly generated plausible normalized drop size distributions were used for rainfall estimation, to evaluate whether this Monte Carlo method would improve the quality of weather radar rainfall products.
   Using the disdrometer information, the best results were obtained in case no differentiation between precipitation type (convective, stratiform and undefined) was made, increasing the event accumulations to more than 80% of those observed by gauges. For the randomly optimized procedure, radar precipitation estimates further improve and closely resemble observations in case one differentiates between precipitation type. However, the optimal parameter sets are very different from those derived from disdrometer observations. It is therefore questionable if single disdrometer observations are suitable for large-scale quantitative precipitation estimation, especially if the disdrometer is located relatively far away from the main rain event, which was the case in this study.

AB Information on soil moisture is vital to describe various hydrological processes. Soil moisture parameters are normally measured using buried sensors in the soil. Alternatively, spatial and temporal characteristics of surface soil moisture are estimated through satellites. Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is one of such satellites that estimate surface soil moisture in an operational context. These estimates need validation prior to use in various hydrological and water management applications. Such validations are normally carried out using field measurements of soil moisture. This is not technically feasible in vast river basins such as the Indus Basin and for pixel sizes of 25 km x 25 km with non-homogeneous soils and land use. Therefore, AMSR-E data interpreted with Njoku model and posted by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) for the Indus Basin is evaluated by comparing it against auxiliary spatial data. The auxiliary data exists of (i) land use, (ii) rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, (iii) seasonality of vegetation from SPOT-Vegetation and (iv) saturated water content (theta(sat)) inferred from soil maps. A strong relationship was observed between rainfall and surface soil moisture in the land use class "rainfed". Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r(s)) between the soil moisture and rainfall ranged from 0.14 to 0.55 with a mean of 0.36. For irrigated land uses, r(s) ranged from 0.04 to 0.52 with a mean of 0.29 due to control of soil moisture by irrigation water supply. The temporal analysis of soil moisture data with vegetation time series showed resemblance with growth phenology. Higher Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the soil moisture and vegetation development was found for time lags of a few weeks. The daily maximum values estimated by AMSR-E ranged from 0.08 to 0.38 cm(3) cm(-3). The maximum values were near, but below theta(sat) limits for different soil types. AMSR-E captured the flooding processes during July and August 2010 by showing the soil moisture values to approximate the saturated soil moisture content for areas that are reported to be flooded. This suggests that the absolute AMSR-E soil moisture data from NSIDC are accurate in the upper range of land wetness.
   It is concluded that AMSR-E surface soil moisture data exhibits spatio-temporal behavior, and the trends agree with auxiliary spatial data sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents an enhancement of the Rating Curve Model (RCM) proposed by Moramarco et al. (2005) which was initially formulated to assess discharge at a downstream river site where only stage is monitored while the flow is recorded at an upstream section and significant lateral inflow can occur along the river branch. The original model formulation is here of fact extended for upstream discharge estimate by assuming the flow known at a downstream site and stages measured at both ends. In this new configuration, the model can be applied to river reaches with negligible lateral inflow or to river reaches with significant lateral contribution but where a kinematic flow regime holds. The new model formulation is tested by considering two case studies, both selected in the Upper-Middle Tiber River basin, in central Italy. For the first case study, the model is applied to 22 flood events observed along three branches of the Tiber River with accurate rating curves at ends and having the same upstream river site. RCM successfully simulates the discharge hydrographs observed at the upstream section closely capturing both the peak rate and the time to peak, with average absolute errors less than 5% and 0.36 h, respectively. The model accuracy is found independent of the intermediate basin area and, hence, of the lateral inflow contribution. The rating curve computed in this upstream section by using the shortest reach is slightly overestimated whereas the ones derived by applying the model to the other two reaches are almost coincident and slightly underestimated, but for all of them the errors are less than 5%.
   The second case study concerns the estimation of the upstream rating curve at a river site, where discharge measurements are available for very low stages alone, starting from the flow known at two different downstream equipped sections. The RCM application to recorded flood events provides two very similar stage-discharge relationships with a maximum difference, between the reproduced rating curves, of about 5 m(3)/s for the higher stage values.
   Moreover, the RCM accuracy is shown to be satisfactory for river reaches located in physiographic regions (northern Italy and Slovak Republic) different from the one used for the model development and testing and considered in the two case studies mentioned above. Finally, the model capability to take implicitly account of the unsteady effects (i.e. rating loop) is shown through experimental data recorded by an ultrasonic flowmeter at a gauged site of the Tiber River as well as by considering a numerical test.

AB Soil moisture is widely recognized as a key parameter in environmental processes mainly for the role of rainfall partitioning into runoff and infiltration. Therefore, for storm rainfall-runoff modeling the estimation of the antecedent wetness conditions (AWC) is one of the most important aspect. In this context, this study investigates the potential of scatterometer on board of the ERS satellites for the assessment of wetness conditions in three Tiber sub-catchments (Central Italy), of which one includes an experimental area for soil moisture monitoring. The satellite soil moisture data are taken from the ERS/METOP soil moisture archive.
   First, the scatterometer-derived soil wetness index (SWI) data are compared with two on-site soil moisture data sets acquired by different methodologies on areas of different extension ranging from 0.01 km(2) to similar to 60 km(2). Moreover, the reliability of SWI to estimate the AWC at a catchment scale is investigated considering the relationship between SWI and the soil potential maximum retention parameter, S, of the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method for abstraction. Several flood events occurred from 1992 to 2005 are selected for this purpose. Specifically, the performance of the SWI for S estimation is compared with two antecedent precipitation indices (API) and one base flow index (BFI). The S values obtained through the observed direct runoff volume and rainfall depth are used as benchmark.
   Results show the great reliability of the SWI for the estimation of wetness conditions both at the plot and catchment scale despite the complex orography of the investigated areas. As far as the comparison with on site soil moisture data set is concerned, the SWI is found quite reliable in representing the soil moisture at layer depth of 15 cm, with a mean correlation coefficient equal to 0.81. The characteristic time length parameter variations, as expected, is depended on soil type, with values in accordance with previous studies. In terms of AWC assessment at catchment scale, based on selected flood events, the SWI is found highly correlated with the observed maximum potential retention of the SCS-CN method with a correlation coefficient R equal to -0.90. Besides, SWI in representing the AWC of the three investigated catchments, outperformed both API indices, poorly representative of AWC, and BFI. Finally, the classical SCS-CN method applied for direct runoff depth estimation, where S is assessed by SWI, provided good performance with a percentage error not exceeding similar to 25% for 80% of investigated rainfall-runoff events.

AB Crop transpiration is the main dissipation way of agricultural water. Accurate and effective estimation of crop transpiration is of great significance for the study of the carbon-water cycle relationship and efficient water -saving irrigation. This study uses infrared thermal imaging technology to accurately extract the average tem-perature of the plant canopy as a key input for the new model (three-dimensional temperature (3D-3T) model), which is an extension of the three-temperature (3T) model and applied to estimate the canopy transpiration rate of typical citrus trees (variety named Guoqing No. 1) from 8:00 to 18:00 on May 7 to 11, 2021. And a processing method for extracting green plants in visible-light images based on the Normalized Difference Ratio Index (NDRI) is proposed for the first time, which can distinguish green plants from other ground objects, backgrounds, and shadows in the visible-light image, and then help to accurately extract the average canopy temperature from infrared thermal images. For this experiment, the canopy structure characteristics of the selected experimental subjects and the measurement methods used were considered, so the 3D-3T model was converted to a 5-point three-temperature model (5P-3T model) to estimate the canopy transpiration rate of citrus trees and evaluate the plant water status, and then the sap flow measurement was used for validation. The results showed that: (1) The 3T model overestimated the transpiration rate of the citrus tree, while the 5P-3T model underestimated it. The estimated values of the 5P-3T model have a good correlation with the measured values of the packaged stem sap flow gauge method, with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.72 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.35 mm/d. (2) In this model, the plant transpiration transfer coefficient (hat) can evaluate the water shortage of plants, where the value of hat increased with the aggravation of plant water stress. (3) The citrus trees have lower transpiration rates under water stress, ranging from 0.06 to 0.12 mm/h in the daytime (from 8-10 May 2021). The model used in this study only needs the input of temperature information and net radiation, and would not depend on aerodynamic resistance. The method in this paper can realize the non-contact and non-invasive measurement of crop transpiration, and it provides a feasible way to use a portable thermal imager to accu-rately obtain the temperature for estimating plant canopy transpiration rate.

AB An increasing number of canals are designed with liners to decrease canal seepage. As the lining material and cracks or holes were previously considered equivalent porous media, few studies have quantified the effects of lining parameters on canal seepage, and the relationships between the reduction factor (beta) of the lining and the crack width (d(f)) and hole density (h(d)) are not explicit, leading to large errors in the estimation of seepage loss. A three-dimensional numerical model is employed to simulate seepage loss from canals lined with concrete and geomembrane material in a total of 1159 scenarios, focusing on the crack locations, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) of concrete material and geomembrane material (K-sc and K-sg, respectively), thickness (T-c), concrete lining d(f), and geomembrane lining h(d). For canals lined with concrete, d(f) is the main factor affecting canal seepage, followed by K-sc and T-c. Cracks with widths smaller than 0.02 mm have minimal influence on where beta is reduced by a decrease in K-sc or an increase in T-c. When d(f) ranges from 0.02 to 0.2 mm, beta increases gradually to a maximum value, while the impacts of K-sc and T-c weaken. For canals lined with geomembranes, beta increases slightly with lid from 0 to 4.2 x 10(-5), increases nearly linearly with log h(d) from 4.2 x 10(-5) to 8.4 x 10(-3), and then approaches 1.0. is weakly influenced by K-sg for particular h(d) values when K-sg is smaller than 10(-11) m/s, increases rapidly with K-sg from 1 x 10(-11) to 1 x 10(-8) m/s, and then exceeds 0.938. For a canal lined with both concrete and a geomembrane, the trends in beta with changes in d(f) and h(d) are identical to those of a canal with a single lining. Based on these results, the damage degree is proposed to evaluate the influence of cracks and holes on the lining effectiveness and as an intermediate variable for calculating beta from d(f) and h(d). Three empirical equations are proposed to calculate the beta value of the concrete lining, geomembrane lining and combined lining with different d(f) and h(d). The results show that the proposed equation improves the accuracy of the estimation of compared with the multiplication model and can be further used for calculations of seepage loss from lined canals.

AB Floods, natural disasters that occur worldwide, have become more and more frequent in recent decades. Flooding is often unavoidable and unexpected; however, it can be controlled through appropriate measures to minimize losses and damage. Flood hazard risk assessment, a holistic approach that involves numerous evaluation indices in river catchments, is an increasingly effective and sustainable practice, but the complicated, non-linear relationship between evaluation indices and risk levels pose a significant challenge to accurate assessment. An intelligent learning machine called random forest (RF) can run efficiently on large databases and provide estimates regarding the importance of specific variables in the classification. This lends RF a considerable advantage in solving the non-linear problems inherent to risk assessment, as well as estimating the importance degree of each index. As such, in this study, an assessment model based on RF was adopted to evaluate regional flood hazard risk. The proposed flood hazard risk assessment method was implemented in Dongjiang River Basin, China. Eleven risk indices were selected and five thousand samples were created for training and testing. The support vector machine (SVM) was used for risk assessment as a comparison, as well as an analysis of index importance degree. Results show that (I) both the training and testing error rate of RF can be reduced by increasing the sample size and the number of classification trees, (2) the higher and highest-risk zones occupy approximately 19.09% of the total, and are primarily located in Baoan, Longgang, Huiyang, Huidong, the western area of Boluo, and the southern part of Dongguang, and (3) the indices maximum three-day precipitation (M3PD), runoff depth (RD), typhoon frequency (TF), digital elevation model (DEM), and topographic wetness index (TWI) are the top five most important out of the eleven risk indices, occupying 71.11% of the total risk; but normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), stream power index (SPI), soil texture (ST), distance to the river (DR), slope (SL), and land use pattern (LUP) indices are less consequential, at only 28.89%. This study shows the potential to provide a novel and highly successful approach to flood hazard risk assessment. Evaluation results provide a reference for flood risk management, prevention, and reduction of natural disasters in the study basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A statistical analysis was undertaken to determine the nature and magnitude of the relationship of precipitation, temperature and streamflow in the western United States to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns.  The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was used as an indicator of the E1 Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the PNA index as an indicator of the Pacific/North America pattern.  These indices were correlated with surface climate data and split sample analyses were conducted to determine climate response during the extreme phases of each index.  October-March precipitation was shown to be most strongly correlated with SOI averaged over the July-November period.  The analysis showed that there are two centers of opposite association with the SOI.  During low values of the SOI (ENSO events) precipitation is low in the Pacific northwest and high in the desert southwest.  Correlations between SOI and temperature were greatest in the Pacific northwest.  The split sample analysis also revealed statistically significant differences in precipitation occurring during extremes of the SOI.  The PNA pattern was related to precipitation and temperature over a concurrent time period.  Especially strong associations were noted in the Pacific northwest for both precipitation and temperature.  Streamflow showed associations with SOI similar to precipitation.

AB A river flow regime describes an average seasonal behaviour of flow and reflects the climatic and physiographic conditions in a basin. Differences in the regularity (stability) of the seasonal patterns reflect different dimensionality of the flow regimes, which can change subject to changes in climate conditions. The empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) approach can be used to describe the intrinsic dimension of river flow regimes and is also an adopted method for reducing the phase space in connection to climate change studies, especially in studies of nonlinear dynamic systems with preferred states. A large data set of monthly river flow for the Nordic countries has been investigated in the phase space reduced to the first few amplitude functions to trace a possible signature of climate change on the seasonal flow patterns. The probability density functions (PDF) of the weight coefficients and their possible change over time were used as an indicator of climate change. Two preferred states were identified connected to stable snowmelt-fed and rainfed flow regimes. The results indicate changes in the PDF patterns with time towards higher frequencies of rainfed regime types. The dynamics of seasonal patterns studied in terms of PDF renders it an adequate and convenient characterization, helping to avoid bias connected to flow regime classifications as well as uncertainties inferred by a modelling approach.

AB Because of their coarse resolution General Circulation Models (GCMs) lack the ability to predict reliably surface variables that may be needed for climate effects studies on a regional scale. Stochastic downscaling methods, based on the relationship between large-scale circulation types and regional surface variables, offer one approach to bridge this scale mismatch. The method explored in this paper uses recursive partitioning (also known as Classification Tree Analysis) to identify circulation patterns (weather states) in observed sea level pressure (SLP) fields that are most closely related to certain rainfall occurrence patterns (dry/wet) at multiple stations. The joint distribution functions of rainfall amounts at a set of stations are then used to define a statistical model for rainfall conditional on these weather states and the previous day's rainfall occurrence/absence. This model is applied to SLP fields from control, 2 x CO2 equilibrium and transient 100 year GCM integrations performed at the Max-Planck-Institut fur Meteorologie, Hamburg to simulate local rainfall corresponding to the large-scale GCM climates.
   The weather generator is applied for several case studies in Australia. Four regions, one each in the West, the North, the Southeast and East of Australia are considered, for the summer and winter seasons, respectively. These regions correspond to different climate zones: the North has mainly summer monsoon rain, the West has dominant frontal winter rainfall, and moderate Southeast has a relatively uniform rainfall distribution throughout the year. Thus, the performance of the weather generator in different climatic regimes can be evaluated.
   Since rainfall amounts are simulated by sampling from historical data a statistical uncertainty is attached to the generated rainfall sequences which is due to the procedure used. This is reflected in uncertainties of the downscaled mean rainfall of generally less than +/- 10%, with larger numerical intervals for dry stations and seasons. The effects of a 2 x CO2 signal in the equilibrium run on local rainfall are not dramatic. For the transient experiment there is an indication of more rainy days and a decrease in the length of dry periods in West Australia in winter. The strongest change is identified in the North in the monsoon season which would have decreasing rainfall. No unequivocal changes were found for the Southeast. However, consistent with earlier studies, the bias of GCM control simulations strongly affects the results, as the difference between precipitation statistics based on observed and control run pressure fields often exceeds the difference between GCM control and altered climate. Considering this deficiency in current GCM simulations, the disagreement between different climate models and the uncertainty attached to the statistical downscaling method, not too much reliance can be put on the relevance of these results for regional hydrologic impact modeling.

AB The stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation are widely used to track processes occurring within the hydrological cycle and understand regional atmospheric patterns that influence a specific area. Moreover, the oxygen isotopic composition of continental carbonates is extensively used for palaeohydrological reconstruction. Nevertheless, few comprehensive investigations have been performed in the Western Mediterranean to analyze the statistical relationships between oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes in precipitation and meteorological variables. For understanding the factors that regulate the rainfall stable isotopic signature at present day in this area of Mediterranean region we selected the Tuscany region (central Italy), due to its considerable climatic seasonality, complex morphology and orography. Tuscany is affected by both Atlantic atmospheric disturbances from NW and moist air masses originated in the Mediterranean, and also by the secondary cyclogenesis center of the Gulf of Genoa, the most active in the entire Mediterranean. The ideal position of the Tuscany region thus offers the opportunity to investigate the complex influence of moisture sources on the rainfall isotopic composition. Moreover, in this region many hydrogeological and palaeohydrological studies were performed and require a more precise and quantitative interpretation.
   In this work, 644 isotope monthly data (delta O-18, delta H-2, and deuterium excess) of precipitation collected in 12 sites through Tuscany from 1971 to 2018 were gathered in a database. Then, only sites whose monthly data covered almost one year were considered for processing, resulting in 553 precipitation samples archived along with monthly mean temperature and rainfall amount. In this framework, the LMWL for Tuscany was determined by applying different regression techniques and statistical analyses were performed to define the influence of meteorological and geographical variables on the rainfall isotopic composition. The outcomes point out the variations of rainfall isotopic signature as result of several climate and geographical variables than a univocal proxy for both local temperature and precipitation amount. The Atlantic and Mediterranean moisture sources differently contribute for generating the observed isotopic variability, and their influence may seasonally change. Overall, the temperature and amount effect allow to explain the 50% of the isotopic variability, but temperature appears to be more important. These local effects are more pronounced during the periods with low rainfall (spring and summer), whereas the large-scale processes (moisture origin, trajectories, and rainout) are prevailing in winter and autumn. The altitude effect is the main driver of isotopic spatial variability. The deuterium excess parameter is revealed to be a very complex but useful signal for disentangling the different contribution of Atlantic and Mediterranean sources in Tuscan precipitation, even if it is sometime misused.

AB Forest harvesting often decreases soil infiltration capacity, leading to rapid and increased delivery of surface runoff, shallow subsurface runoff, and sediment to streams. While the general harvest area is typically the largest area of disturbance, relative to forest roads or skid trails, less is known about the degree to which the general harvest areas act as sources or sinks for runoff and sediment transport. This includes a need to improve understanding of the potential for runoff and sediment delivery from harvest areas through riparian buffers to streams during infrequent, high intensity precipitation events, which are predicted to increase due to climate change. In this study, we used rainfall simulations to investigate surface/shallow subsurface runoff, and sediment transport from plots during extreme precipitation events within a steep, headwater catchment in the Rocky Mountains. Simulations consisted of one hour of high intensity rainfall (I-60: 70-80 mm h(-1)), representative of an similar to 100 year, or greater, storm event for the northern Rocky Mountain region. Our objectives were to compare runoff rates, sediment concentrations, and sediment yields between the general harvest area, along the edge of the riparian buffer at the interface with the harvested area, and within the riparian buffer. Surface/shallow subsurface runoff rates were greatest in the riparian buffer relative to the harvest area, especially when soil conditions were dry. Mechanical soil disturbance during forest harvesting appeared to result in higher infiltration rates and vertical, preferential flow relative to the riparian buffer. However, sediment concentrations in runoff from plots in the general harvest area were similar to 15.8-times greater than in the riparian buffer and similar to 4.2-times greater than at the harvest-riparian edge. Comparatively, sediment yields in the general harvest area were similar to 2.0-times greater than in the riparian buffer and similar to 1.2-times greater than at the harvest-riparian edge. Quantitative and qualitative evidence suggests differences in runoff and sediment between the harvest area, harvest-riparian edge, and riparian buffer were due to site differences in hydrophobicity, surface roughness, soil water content, and sediment supply. While we observed moderately high variability with only modest replication, the spatial patterns in the amount and timing of runoff, sediment production, and their relationships with soil moisture were consistent and monotonic along the gradient from harvested areas through riparian buffers. This highlights the need for additional research to explore if similar patterns appear evident after forest harvesting in other hydro-climatic settings.

AB Dynamically Coupled Socioeconomic system dynamics models integrated with physically-based Environmental Models (DCSEM) can capture relationships between complex environmental and socioeconomic systems, and are promising tools for participatory environmental management involving the integration of various viewpoints, disciplines and processes for sustainable water resources management. However, the application of DCSEMs has been limited for many reasons, including the complexity of the model coupling process (i.e., the lack of a flexible model coupling approach), issues of over-parameterization, high parameter uncertainty, intensive computational requirements (due to many interacting parameters), and the possibility of eliciting behaviour-pattern oriented model outputs. As such, most conventional (numerical) procedures for model evaluation (i.e., analysis of point values of modelled results) that have been implemented for physically-based models are not applicable to DCSEMs. In order to address these challenges, this study developed a novel automatic behaviour-pattern global sensitivity analysis (GSA) procedure to determine the influence of input parameters on the general behaviour trends (rather than numerical point values) of coupled model outputs. The developed behaviour-pattern GSA procedure was implemented in an existing software (Tinamit), developed previously by the authors, to ensure ease-of-use. This study investigates the suitability of the proposed behaviour-pattern GSA procedure for the analysis of DCSEMs by comparing the proposed procedure with the conventional numerical procedure. The numerical and proposed behaviour-pattern procedures, coupled with the Morris (qualitative) and EFAST (quantitative) GSA methods, were applied to a DCSEM to rank and screen parameters in a water table depth simulation in Pakistan. The determination of important parameters facilitates subsequent model calibration and groundwater management. It was found that the Morris and EFAST methods achieved similar parameter ranking results in the numerical and behavioural procedures, respectively. The results also indicated that the behaviourpattern GSA procedure offers more information about several important parameters, and a variety of parameter ranking orders, compared to the numerical GSA procedure, regardless of which GSA method (Morris or EFAST) was used. The increased information obtained through the application of the developed behaviour-pattern procedure confirms that the DCSEM model outputs are behaviour-oriented. It is recommended that the proposed behaviour-pattern GSA procedure be used with the Morris method, which has a higher computational efficiency (>150 times) than the EFAST method, to detect important parameters in DCSEMs.

AB The regulating function is the least understood but probably most valuable service provided by an ecosystem. To estimate the impact of externalities on the regulating function of a wetland, we modelled the interdependence between activities that affect wetland characteristics and land utilization patterns. Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide benefits for society, the economy and nature. The NBS solution for wetland bioremediation is proposed through a combination of ecosystem value provided by nature-based or artificial arable land. We constructed a model to simulate the dynamic spatial and temporal changes in the regulating function of a wetland to study the impact of agricultural and fishing activities on the functions and services of a wetland ecosystem. The model was used to determine the relationship between land use change, wetland range, water quality, and fish stocks. Huangqihai Lake (HQHL) is a relatively isolated lake in an area interlaced with agriculture and pasture zones. From 1973 to 2014, the "shrinkage" of the water area of HQHL approached 60%. Under the influence of humans and natural disturbances, the HQHL wetland faced enormous ecological risks, water pollution, area reduction, sharp biodiversity reduction, and fish extinction. The phosphorus (P) concentration seems to be a key factor affecting both the reed growth in the nearshore areas of the Huangqihai Lake wetland and the breeding of phytoplankton in the core lake water area. Dividing this value by the 25,821 ha of the core wetland area affected by the reclamation, the cost per unit of lost fish production is USD$166/ha/yr. After deducting the externalities of the fishery, the net sustainable income from the conversion is USD$1717/ha. The spatial distribution of nutrient load externalities varies with the use of wetlands. In terms of fishery value, the additional nutrient load associated with the conversion of wetland uses would result in a reduction of at least 8% of the maximum sustainable yield. The conversion of wetland uses resulted in the loss of nutrient buffering functions. To compensate for the farmland's nutrient load buffer service, the government should provide arable land farmers USD$8.1 M/yr. It is theoretically feasible to implement an ecosystem service payment system that can effectively compensate for the loss of nutrient buffer function caused by the conversion of wetlands. The approach based on BNS we described may also have value in other ecosystems where regulatory functions include similar mechanisms.

AB This paper deals with the effects of land levelling on soil hydrological properties and spatial variability of soil moisture at different depths in bare vineyard fields under different rainfall distributions over the year. The research was carried out in a levelled vineyard in the Penedes region (NE Spain), which is representative of the land management practices in that area. Twelve locations were instrumented in the selected plot to control soil moisture periodically at different depths (0-20, 20-40, 40-60 cm, using a TDR tube probe), and runoff (using Gerlach collectors located at the same positions) during the period April 2002-March 2004. Rainfalls were recorded at one-minute intervals in the experimental field using a pluviometer linked to a data-logger. The vine yield and its relationship with the rainfall distribution over the year was evaluated in this levelled vineyard vs. a less transformed vineyard. The land levelling works carried out in the plot before the establishment of the vineyard led to major differences in soil depth (ranging from 50 to 110 cm) and in soil layer characteristics along and across the plot. This helps to generate different soil moisture conditions at the same depth at different positions of the plot. The areas located at the top of the plot showed soil moisture conditions in the surface layer that were up to 5% lower than down slope, although with high variability across the plot. Soil moisture in the whole profile depends on the intensity of rainfall more than total rainfall. At high intensities, soil moisture increases only occur in the surface layer, but no significant increases are observed in deeper layers, where vines have most of their roots. On the other hand, under low intensity rainfalls the soil water content increases in the whole profile. Levelled plots showed a yield reduction in comparison with those undergoing less transformation, which was exacerbated by a very irregular rainfall distribution: for a similar total rainfall, but with dry periods during the stages in which the water requirement for vines is higher, grape production was up to 50% lower in areas with high land trans formation, where Chardonnay was planted, and up to 16% lower at the bottom areas, where Macabeo was planted.

AB The Kling-Gupta efficiency, hereafter referred to as KG efficiency rather than its common abbreviation KGE, proposed by Gupta et al. (2009) has become a widely used metric for evaluating the goodness-of-fit of n-vectors of observations, (y) over tilde = [(y) over tilde (1) (y) over tilde (2) ... (y) over tilde (n)](inverted perpendicular), and corresponding model simulations, y(theta) = [y(1)(theta) y(2)(theta) ... y(n)(theta)](inverted perpendicular). This metric rectifies some of the shortcomings of the coefficient of determination, R-2, also known to hydrologists as the efficiency of Nash and Sutcliffe (1970), by using a Euclidean-distance based weighting of the correlation, bias and temporal variability of the observed, (y) over tilde, and simulated, y(theta), data. But as the KG efficiency is not borne out of assumptions with respect to the statistical distribution of the residuals, e(theta) = (y) over tilde - y(theta), we cannot formally characterize its uncertainty. The NS efficiency suffers a similar problem, yet, statistical theory postulates that its confidence intervals should follow a beta distribution in certain special cases. Without a formal description of the confidence intervals of the KG efficiency, we cannot (amongst others) quantify parameter uncertainty, compute confidence and prediction limits on simulated model responses, inform decision makers about critical modeling uncertainties, evaluate model adequacy and assess the information content of calibration data. More fundamentally, without confidence intervals we cannot establish whether the KG efficiency is a consistent, efficient and unbiased estimator. In this paper we present an empirical description of the confidence intervals of the KG efficiency. We relate the unknown probability distribution of the KG efficiency to the measurement errors of the training data record, (y) over tilde, and use the bootstrap method to carry out statistical inference. We illustrate our method by application to a simple linear regression function for which the least squares parameter confidence regions are exactly known and two hydrologic models of contrasting complexity. The empirical parameter confidence regions and/or intervals of the KG efficiency are compared to those derived from generalized least squares, objective function contouring and Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The marginal parameter distributions of the KG efficiency are generally well described by a normal distribution. Results further confirm that the distribution of the KG efficiency is a complex function of data length and the magnitude, distribution and structure of the measurement errors. This prohibits an analytic description of the empirical confidence regions and/or intervals of the KG efficiency and reiterates the need for the bootstrap method.

AB The study presented here is focussed on the question of the hydraulic nature of the threshold that allows a rill to start. A rainfall-simulation experiment was carried out to produce high-resolution flow-velocity data. The experiment employed a 10 m x 4 m experimental plot with a 1% slope, which had been previously eroded and had a small rill formed in the middle. The experiment consisted of a 2 h 15'-Long rainfall at a constant intensity of 69 mm h(-1). Surface elevation was measured before rainfall at a horizontal resolution of 2.5 cm across, and 5 cm along the slope direction. During rainfall, flow-velocities were measured at 68 locations on the plot with the salt velocity gauge technology, an automated, miniaturized device based on the inverse modelling of the propagation of a salt plume. The experiment led to the collection of flow-velocity measurements which are novel in three ways: (i) the small size of the measured section, which was only 10-cm long and 1-cm wide, (ii) the wide range of measured flow-velocities, which ranged from 0.006 m s(-1) to 0.27 m s(-1) and, (iii) the large number of measured locations.
   The flow-velocity field was simulated with three models: PSEM_2D solves the Saint-Venant equations in 2D, MAHLERAN uses a 1D kinematic wave in the slope direction coupled with a 2D flow-routing algorithm, and Rillgrow2, which involves an empirical runoff algorithm that is close in principle to the diffusion-wave equation in 2D. The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (ff) and the infiltration parameters were calibrated in all cases to investigate the capabilities of the different models to reproduce flow hydraulics compatible with the onset of rilling. In a first set of numerical experiments, ff was set uniform, and calibration used only the hydrograph. The comparison of simulated and observed flow-velocity field showed that PSEM_2D was the most satisfying model, at the cost of longer computational time. MAHLERAN gave surprisingly good results with regards to the simplicity of the model and its low computational needs. However, all models largely underestimated the highest velocity values, located in the rill. Furthermore, none of the models was able to simulate the Reynolds (Re) and Froude (Fr) numbers. The next numerical experiment was done with PSEM_2D. Non-uniform ff values were calibrated by fitting the simulated flow-velocity field to the observed one. The latter simulation produced realistic simulations of Re and Fr. The hydraulic conditions at the transition from interrill flow to rill flow are discussed. The results support the theory that supercritical flows are a necessary condition for a rill to emerge from a smooth surface. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The scalar roughness length for temperature, z(0h), is necessary to estimate the sensible flux from atmospheric surface layer similarity theory in conjunction with skin temperature measurements. A theoretical relationship for z(0h) as a function of the roughness Reynolds number z(0+) which was developed by Brutsaert [1975] for rough-bluff surfaces is often used to link infrared skin temperature measurements to atmospheric temperature measurements. Measurements of sensible heat flux and temperature at two semiarid sites are used to evaluate and test the temperature roughness length model coefficients. Consideration of the measurement error is important to derive an accurate set of coefficients. These new field-based coefficients correct for some of the underprediction of sensible heat flux at high flux rates that occurred with past formulations.

AB Understanding and simulating dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations is a challenge with important implications for water quality projections and carbon balance estimates, particularly at the event-scale. Hy-drological dryness/wetness represents water shortage/surplus in surface water. Previous studies have analyzed the dynamic patterns of DOC concentrations during either dryness or wetness (or rewetting) periods. However, the dynamic patterns of DOC concentrations and corresponding simulations during both dryness and wetness events, based on their characteristics (i.e., duration and severity), remain to be fully understood, particularly under multiple timescales. This study proposed a framework to help overcome this limitation. The standardized streamflow index (SSI) combined with run theory was used to describe the dryness/wetness characteristics at the monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. Simulation models were constructed and validated based on the multi -variable linear regression model and cross-validation method. Three evaluation indicators, namely, the coeffi-cient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE, %), were employed to determine the optimal model. This model was then applied to additional basins based on the correction coefficient method. Three nearby basins (HP3a, HP4, and HP6), with different catchment areas (9.28 to 122.80 ha) and long-term (41 years) daily streamflow and weekly (or biweekly) DOC measurements in the Harp Lake catchment, south-central Ontario, Canada, were used to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. Data from HP3a was used to construct and validate the simulation model, and the model was applied to the HP4 and HP6 basins. Results show that the average DOC concentration during the dryness events is lower than that in the wetness events at the monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. The average, maximum, and minimum DOC concentrations during the dryness events increased with the dryness/wetness index timescales, but decreased during the wetness events. The optimal model was able to accurately simulate the DOC concentrations (R-2 >= 0.90, NSE >= 0.90, and MAPE <= 10 %) at the monthly, seasonal, and annual scales based on the hydrological characteristics during the dryness and wetness periods, respectively, and the application results exhibit a good performance. The proposed framework can help improve the forecasting of DOC concentrations and the corre-sponding ecological coping strategies at the event-scale under changing environments.

AB Soil moisture is an important component in hydrological cycles but is highly variable in space and time. As a tool for optimal soil and water management and effective field monitoring, the analysis of temporal stability has recently received increasing interest. The scale dependence of temporal stability, however, has received little attention. We measured surface-soil (0-6 cm) moisture at 187 sampling locations in a desert region (40 km(2)) in northwestern China approximately every two weeks from April to October 2012 with a Theta Probe, for a total of 13 sampling campaigns. We grouped the samples by re-sampling analysis under six sampling spacings and six different sizes of sampling area (extents) to analyse the changes in the characteristics of temporal stability at the various sampling scales and to test the accuracy of the field-mean moisture content estimated by measurements at a limited number of locations at each sampling scale. Increasing the spacing had little influence on the temporal stability of both the overall spatial pattern and the individual locations, whereas increasing the extent tended to increase the temporal stability of the overall spatial pattern but to decrease the temporal stability at the individual locations. The characteristics of temporal stability were susceptible to changes in scale when extent was small. Exponential and power equations could well express the relationships between most of the parameters of temporal stability and sampling scale. The number of identified representative locations (RLs) was influenced by sample size and was more sensitive to changes in sample size caused by extent than by spacing. At all sampling scales, the sets of selected RLs accurately estimated the field mean for the entire study period by using offset estimates, and the estimate accuracy was not affected by sampling scale. Increasing the spacing did not change the influence of topography and soil properties on temporal stability, whereas increasing the extent tended to intensify the influence of relative elevation and soil organic carbon content but to weaken the influence of saturated hydraulic conductivity on temporal stability. This study contributes to our understanding of the dependence of temporal stability of soil moisture in desert ecosystems on sampling scale and will help the integration of information from different spatial scales and the design of optimal sampling sizes and strategies for similar studies.

AB This paper reviews the current knowledge of hydrological processes in Chilean temperate forests which extend along western South America from latitude 29 degrees S to 56 degrees S. This geographic region includes a diverse range of natural and planted forests and a broad sweep of vegetation, edaphic, topographic, geologic, and climatic set-tings which create a unique natural laboratory. Many local communities, endangered freshwater ecosystems, and downstream economic activities in Chile rely on water flows from forested catchments. This review aims to (i) provide a comprehensive overview of Chilean forest hydrology, to (ii) review prior research in forest hydrology in Chile, and to (iii) identify knowledge gaps and provide a vision for future research on forest hydrology in Chile. We reviewed the relation between native forests, commercial plantations, and other land uses on water yield and water quality from the plot to the catchment scale. Much of the global understanding of forests and their relationship with the water cycle is in line with the findings of the studies reviewed here. Streamflow from forested catchments increases after timber harvesting, native forests appear to use less water than plantations, and streams draining native forest yield less sediment than streams draining plantations or grassland/shrublands. We identified 20 key knowledge gaps such as forest groundwater systems, soil-plant-atmosphere interactions, native forest hydrology, and the effect of forest management and restoration on hydrology. Also, we found a paucity of research in the northern geographic areas and forest types (35-36 degrees S); most forest hydrology studies in Chile (56%) have been conducted in the southern area (Los Rios Region around 39-40 degrees S). There is limited knowledge of the geology and soils in many forested areas and how surface and groundwater are affected by changes in land cover. There is an opportunity to advance our understanding using process-based investigations linking field studies and modeling. Through the establishment of a forest hydrology science "society" to coor-dinate efforts, regional and national-scale land use planning might be supported. Our review ends with a vision to advance a cross-scale collaborative effort to use new nation-wide catchment-scale networks Long-term Ecosystem Research (LTER) sites, to promote common and complementary techniques in these studies, and to conduct transdisciplinary research to advance sound and integrated planning of forest lands in Chile.

AB Effects of forest treatments on watershed hydrology in terms of water yield and runoff processes is a primary concern. This paper evaluates the effects of long-term land cover change on hydrological processes in the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed (MCEW) in northern Idaho, USA. In the MCEW, effects of clearcut and partial cut harvest practices on streamflow were monitored and evaluated from 1991 to 2013. Firstly, snowpack dynamics in terms of snowmelt timing and average melt rate under different elevations, aspects, land covers, and climate conditions were analyzed at the point-scale with the snow accumulation and melt (SAM) model from the perspective of the energy balance. Then, the grid-based soil moisture routing (SMR) hydrology model was used to provide temporal and spatial hydrological changes in the MCEW. We assigned locations as hydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) based on the probability of runoff generation (P(A(i) = HS)) to capture potential downstream environmental effects of actual land cover change and optimal harvest patterns. The results highlight the strong impacts timber harvest can have on increasing streamflow and, in particular, peak flow. On average, the daily averaged degree of saturation increased by 20% after timber harvest resulting in higher risks of flooding from large rainfall events. Three logging scenarios including logging in areas with low P(A(i) = HS), high P(A(i) = HS), and in the entire watershed area, showed that logging areas had a positive relationship with water yield and that more extreme peak flow was likely to occur after clearcutting in high P(A(i) = HS) areas (high elevation) under rainfall driven events or logging in low P(A(i) = HS) areas (medium elevation) during snowmelt dominated events. Clearcutting on south-facing slopes at medium elevation strongly increased the average melt rate leading to potential flooding if a snowpack was present and temperatures increased. Scenario analysis suggests that partial cutting in areas with low P(A(i) = HS) would reduce peak flow amount by as much as 40%. However, for watersheds to be logged entirely, choosing proper harvest locations such as clearcutting in high P(A(i) = HS) areas having large snow events may effectively reduce extreme peak flow from spring snowmelt. Our findings inform forest management decisions favoring partial cutting over clearcutting, and how to avoid concentrating harvest practices in HSAs by adapting spatial distribution and timing of harvesting to climate conditions to minimize impacts on the water cycle.

AB In any aquatic system analysis, the modelling water quality parameters are of considerable significance. The traditional modelling methodologies are dependent on datasets that involve large amount of unknown or unspecified input data and generally consist of time-consuming processes. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) leads to a flexible mathematical structure that has the capability to identify non-linear and complex relationships between input and output data. There has been a major degradation of the Johor River Basin because of several developmental and human activities. Therefore, setting up of a water quality prediction model for better water resource management is of critical importance and will serve as a powerful tool. The different modelling approaches that have been implemented include: Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-ANN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-ANN). However, data obtained from monitoring stations and experiments are possibly polluted by noise signals as a result of random and systematic errors. Due to the presence of noise in the data, it is relatively difficult to make an accurate prediction. Hence, a Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (WDT-ANFIS) based augmented wavelet de-noising technique has been recommended that depends on historical data of the water quality parameter. In the domain of interests, the water quality parameters primarily include ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), suspended solid (SS) and pH. In order to evaluate the impacts on the model, three evaluation techniques or assessment processes have been used. The first assessment process is dependent on the partitioning of the neural network connection weights that ascertains the significance of every input parameter in the network. On the other hand, the second and third assessment processes ascertain the most effectual input that has the potential to construct the models using a single and a combination of parameters, respectively. During these processes, two scenarios were introduced: Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. Scenario 1 constructs a prediction model for water quality parameters at every station, while Scenario 2 develops a prediction model on the basis of the value of the same parameter at the previous station (upstream). Both the scenarios are based on the value of the twelve input parameters. The field data from 2009 to 2010 was used to validate WDT-ANFIS. The WDT-ANFIS model exhibited a significant improvement in predicting accuracy for all the water quality parameters and outperformed all the recommended models. Also, the performance of Scenario 2 was observed to be more adequate than Scenario 1, with substantial improvement in the range of 0.5% to 5% for all the water quality parameters at all stations. On validating the recommended model, it was found that the model satisfactorily predicted all the water quality parameters (R-2 values equal or bigger than 0.9).

AB An increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration (CO2) affects stomatal conductance (g(s)). Since g(s) is an important parameter in the Penman-Monteith model (P-M), an accurate estimate of g, can improve the accuracy of the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) by P-M when CO2 increases. This paper identifies three models of the relationship between g(s) and CO2 (the linear model, L, the hyperbolic model, H, and the modified hyperbolic model, MH), and compares their estimations of ET when they are incorporated into P-M. A two-year experiment which included four levels (400, 550, 700, and 900 mu mol mol(-1)) and three levels (400, 550, and 700 mu mol mol(-1)) of CO2 in 2015 and 2016, respectively, was conducted in order to obtain validation data. Fifty papers that had studied the effect of increased CO2 on g(s), over a 45-year period, were analyzed to obtain calibration data. After being calibrated and validated, each of the three models was in turn included as a component of P-M to estimate ET under increased CO2, followed by the comparison between estimated and observed ET. The sensitivity of P-M to the parameters in three models was also analyzed. Our results show that g, decreased and the reduction rate gradually lessened as CO2 increased. Of the three models, MH gave the best estimate of g(s), having the largest values of the coefficient of determination (R-2), 0.97, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), 0.96, and the modified affinity index (d), 0.93, and the smallest values of the root mean square error (RMSE), 0.03, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), - 47.48. Each of the three models gave different ET results for different levels of CO2 when used as a component of P-M. The MH had better ET estimations than L and H when compared to observed ET across all CO2 concentration levels, with the highest R-2, NSE, and d, and the lowest RMSE and MC. The sensitivity of P-M to the empirical parameters varied among the three models, for instance, +/- 40 and +/- 20% changes of parameter p in L, g(smaxp), and and C-s0 in H, and b in MH resulted in -15 to 4%, -13 to 7%, - 9 to 4%, and - 3 to 3% changes in predicted ET, respectively. Thus, changes of parameter b in MH had minimum effect on predicted ET, indicating greater stability of P-M in ET estimation by incorporating MH. Therefore, using MH to model the response of g(s) to increased CO2 when incorporated into P-M to estimate ET not only represents a more appropriate stomata physiological reaction to higher CO2, but also results in a more accurate estimate of ET, and making the model more broadly applicable.

AB Dams alter downstream river flow and sediment regimes, causing significant changes in river morphologies. The middle Yangtze River downstream of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has experienced rapid erosion in recent years, and the associated morphodynamic changes have negatively impacted the riverbank stability, navigation waterways and ecological functioning. Earlier studies have analyzed recent channel adjustments in the Yangtze River; however, our understanding of changes in the bar morphodynamics remains incomplete. In this study, we collected and analyzed flow and sediment data (1991-2016) and river bathymetry data (1975-2017) and investigated the mechanisms of bar adjustments along the Jingjiang Reach in the post-TGD period. The results indicate that most steady bars with a higher elevation and better vegetation coverage have experienced lateral erosion, while their elevations have remained stable overall. The unvegetated migrating bars with a lower elevation have experienced severe surficial erosion and area shrinkages. A new assessment method of the dominant discharge range on downstream bars is provided after dam closure. The dominant discharge range that determines bar adjustments corresponds to the flow stages between the submersion of migrating bars (similar to 12,500 m(3)/s) and the overtopping of vegetated steady bars (similar to 27,500 m(3)/s) in the Jingjiang Reach. A quantitative relationship exists between bar erosion in response to changed dominant discharge regimes and sediment decline. The significant bar erosion after the operation of the TGD can be attributed to the increased flow duration and the sharp decline in the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) of the dominant discharge range, and changes in SSCs play a primary role. The bar area will decrease by similar to 0.003 km(2) when the annual cumulative duration of the dominant discharge increases by one day and by similar to 0.234 km(2) when the annual average SSC of the dominant discharge decreases by 0.01 kg/m(3). Furthermore, vegetation encroachment and colonization play a positive role in stabilizing bar morphologies and limiting surficial erosion, whereas vegetation soley cannot prevent the lateral erosion of steady bars. These findings suggest that multiple controls of discharge, sediment and vegetation on the evolution of fluvial bars and have important implications for river management and ecological evaluation in response to the operation of large dams.

AB Determining the soil moisture content (SMC) distribution is indispensable for field management, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Effective parameters can contribute to the optimization of SMC models for accurate SMC prediction. Therefore, in this study, the relationships between the SMC and multifractal parameters (D-2, D-v, D-s, A(v), and F-v denote the correlation dimension, property of small probability and large probability, spectrum width, and symmetry of spectrum shape, respectively) of the soil particle size distribution (PSD) were explored in the hilly loess region of China. A grid method was adopted (20 m x 20 m, total = 384 points) to sample the SMC in the 0-40 cm and 40-80 cm soil layers on the second, eighth, and twelfth days after the first rainfall, which were defined as the early sampling (ES), medium sampling (MS), and late sampling (LS), respectively. We found that the variation in the SMC explained by the multifractal parameters increased as SMC decreased, where they accounted for 40.07% and 75.75% of the SMC in the 0-40 cm and 40-80 cm soil layers in LS, respectively. The variation in the SMC in the 0-40 cm explained by the multifractal parameters was lower than that in the 40-80 cm soil layer in all sampling stages. The equations fitted for the whole soil layer were significant in all sampling stages (P < 0.01). A(v) (31.95%) and D-v (13.59%) had negative correlations with SMC, and their relative importance values with respect to SMC were high in all sampling stages (P < 0.05). SMC at higher values had a positive correlation with F-v, whereas SMC at lower values had a significant positive correlation with D-2 and negative correlation with D-s, and these two parameters in the MS and LS stages explained more than 75% of the variation in the SMC in the 40-80 cm soil layer. These results suggest that the characteristics of the soil PSD can be described in detail by the multifractal parameters, which can directly reflect the SMC. Thus, we conclude that SMC is closely related to the multifractal parameters of the PSD (A(v), D-v, D-s, D-2, and F-v) and it can be applied to optimize SMC models.

AB Water storage dynamics modulate fluxes within catchments, control the rainfall-runoff response and regulate the velocity of water particles through mixing associated processes. Tracer-aided models are useful tools for tracking the interactions between catchment storage and fluxes, as they can capture both the celerity of the runoff response and the velocity of water particles revealed by tracer dynamics. The phase-space reconstruction of modelled systems can help in this regard; it traces the evolution of a dynamic system from a known initial state as phase trajectories in response to inputs. In this study, we compared the modelled storage-flux dynamics obtained from the application of a spatially distributed tracer-aided hydrological model (STARR) in five contrasting long-term research catchments with varying degrees of snow influence. The models were calibrated using a consistent multivariate methodology based on discharge, isotope composition and snowpack water equivalent. Analysis of extracted modelled storage dynamics gave insights into the system functioning. Large volumes of total stored water needed to be invoked at most sites to reconcile celerity and travel times to match observe discharge and isotope responses. This is because changes in dynamic storage from water balance considerations are small when compared to volume of storage necessary for observed tracer dampening. In the phase-space diagrams, the rates of storage change gave insights into the relative storage volume and seasonal catchment functioning. The storage increase was dominated by hydroclimatic inputs; thus, it presented a stochastic response. Furthermore, depending on the dominance of snow or rainfall inputs, catchments had different seasonal responses in storage dynamics. Decreases in storage were more predictable and reflected the efficiency of catchment drainage, yet at lower storages the influence of ET was also evident. Activation of flow paths due to overland and near-surface flows resulted in non-linearity of catchment functioning largely at high storage states. The storage-discharge relationships generally showed a non-linear distribution, with more scattered states during wettest condition. In turn, all the catchments exhibited an inverse storage effect, with modelled water ages decreasing with increasing storage as lateral flow paths were activated. Insights from this inter-comparison of storage-flux-age dynamics show the benefits of tracer-aided hydrological models in exploring their interactions at well-instrumented sites to better understand hydrological functioning of contrasting catchments.

AB Soil water infiltration simulation is a subject receiving great interest in hydrological cycle modelling. The traditional Horton equation is based on the curve of infiltration capacity-rainfall duration time. However, the infiltration process is directly affected by soil moisture content, rather than rainfall duration. The objective of this study was to determine a relationship between infiltration capacity and soil moisture content in order to improve the Horton infiltration equation. Artificial rainfall-infiltration experiments were used to determine a series of power functions. The improved equation was cross-validated with observations from 32 experiments of multiple rainfall intensities and antecedent soil moisture. The simulation performance and uncertainty of the improved equation were compared with those of the original Horton equation to verify its accuracy. The results showed that infiltration rate decreases nonlinearly as soil moisture increases, and finally approaches a stable infiltration rate when the soil is saturated. Overland flow simulations by the improved Horton equation closely matched the observations from all 32 experiments over a soil moisture range of 0.222-0.349 m(3)/m(3). The simulation performance was rated as good for most of the experiments for both the calibration and validation data sets. Compared with the original Horton equation, the simulation performance of the improved equation clearly improved estimation of infiltration, particularly as quantified by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The number of simulations with NSE values greater than 0.65 increased 11.59% and 2.50% for the calibration and validation data sets, respectively. The number of simulations with R-2 values greater than 0.90 increased 31.14% and 22.50%, respectively. The uncertainty intervals of the improved Horton equation became a little greater than those of the original Horton equation. For all 32 experimental simulations, the average relative length of the uncertainty interval at the 95% confidence level increased from 40.52% with the original Horton equation to 49.17% with the improved Horton equation. The number of observations falling within the 95% confidence interval increased from 92.13% to 95.94% with the improved Horton equation. Most of the observations were accurately simulated using the improved Horton equation. The greatest improvements in simulating overland flow were seen for the experiments with low flow simulations. The study results provide insights into soil infiltration mechanisms, and also provide references to support improved infiltration simulation by considering soil moisture variation.

AB Serious soil desiccation, resulting from climatic conditions and poor land management, may lead to the formation of a dried soil layer (DSL), which can negatively affect ecological and hydrological processes. To mitigate these effects through management, it is necessary to understand property interactions within DSLs, compared with those in the whole soil profile, and DSL formation processes under different land uses. We investigated the relationships between soil water content (SWC) and plant root indices, and other soil properties, under various land uses in the Liudaogou watershed on the Loess Plateau, China. We also studied the development of DSLs as a function of the growth age of two vegetation types. Rate of formation and thickness of DSLs were dependent on vegetation type: DSLs formed after 2 years of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) growth and 3 years of Caragana korshinskii growth; after 4 years of growth, DSLs under alfalfa were thicker than those under C korshinskii, but after 31 years the DSL thickness under C korshinskii (4.4 m) exceeded that formed under alfalfa (3 m). The more persistent DSLs occurred below a 100 cm thick upper soil layer that was seasonally dried and replenished by rainfall under both vegetation types. The degree of soil desiccation under natural vegetation was generally less than that under non-indigenous plant species, and was similarly less over a period of about 30 years for a natural plant succession sequence than for an artificial one. Thus, the use of natural vegetation succession management principles would possibly reduce soil desiccation during vegetative restoration. Densities of root length, weight, and surface area, and the average root diameter of soybean (Glycine max), alfalfa, Stipa bubgeana, and C korshinskii all decreased with increases in soil depths below 20 cm. Correlations between SWC and root indices, and various soil physical and chemical properties, were generally weaker within the DSL layers than within the whole soil profile. The only significant correlation was between soil organic carbon and SWC under alfalfa (r = 0.627, P < 0.05). Soil desiccation may thus interfere with these typical interrelationships occurring within the whole soil profile. Our findings may provide a helpful base reference for the control and restoration of DSLs occurring on the Loess Plateau and in similar and and semi-arid regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB Within the scope of the HAPEX-Sahel experiment, the hydrological functioning of two small nested catchments was studied at two different scales: the plot scale (of the order of 100 m(2)) and the catchment scale (0.2 km(2)). At local scale, four runoff plots were set-up on the typical soil surface conditions observed on the catchments (plateau bare soil, two plots on fallow grassland) and an additional one was installed on a millet field. Soil moisture investigations at the plot scale have shown that infiltration was limited between 0.6 to 2 m deep on three sites, but was deeper than 3.4 m on the most pervious site (millet). The maximum water storage on all the sites was found to be reached at the maximum activity of the rainy season (late August), and not at the end of the season. During the dry months, the soil was fully dried off by evapotranspiration, resulting in the absence of inter-annual soil water storage. No influence of vegetation cover on runoff was observed on the fallow sites, but runoff generation was found to be very sensitive to tillage on the millet field. The parameter P-u, calculated from a rainfall hyetograph and defined as the rainfall depth that can actually produce runoff, is shown to be relevant to compute runoff on untilled soils, as it explains more than 87% of the variance in runoff depth. On tilled soils, it is necessary to take into account additionally the temporal evolution of the soil surface, especially the days after weeding operations. Simple linear relationships were derived to compute runoff depth from P-u on the plots for the most typical soil moisture conditions observed, and modified SCS equations have been derived for the catchments. Using the linear equations derived at the plot scale in a simple, empirical, semi-distributed model lead to formulate the assumption that the partial source area concept applied on the catchments. Analysis of discharge data at the catchment scale highlights that seepage through the bottom of a gully between two gauging stations leads to the abstraction of non negligible volumes of water. Moreover, the water totally infiltrates in a spreading zone downstream from the outlet of the largest catchment showing that discontinuities occur in the surface water transmission within a catena. Such discontinuities constitute a major problem for the concern of aggregation of hydrologic precesses. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in precipitation, which are sensitive to climate change and the water cycle, are widely used as natural tracers to investigate hydrological processes and paleoclimate reconstruction. High resolution event-based precipitation sampling was conducted in Guilin, a subtropical monsoon climate region in Southwest China, from 2010 to 2016 to identify the temporal variability of stable isotopes of precipitation and its dominant meteorological factors. The results showed that the stable isotopes of precipitation exhibited significant seasonal variability, with lower values in the wet season and higher values in the dry season, reflecting the changes in the character of precipitation in response to seasonal variability of the moisture sources and atmospheric dynamics. delta O-18 values were significantly negatively correlated with temperature and potential evapotranspiration (ET0) on the daily and monthly timescales; however, there was no significant correlation between monthly delta O-18 and the amount of rainfall. Multivariate regression analysis showed that when temperature, precipitation amount and ET0 were considered, 39% of the variability of the monthly oxygen isotope composition of precipitation was explained. Monthly mean temperature had a higher covariation with precipitation delta O-18, indicating that the variations of precipitation isotope were more dependent on temperature, but not substantially dependent on the amount effect of rainfall. Howerver, the main influence of meteorological factors on the isotopic variations of precipitation varied seasonally. Temperature strongly influenced the isotopic composition of precipitation in summer, while the amount effect was prominent due to the enhanced convective activity characterized by more depleted delta O-18 values. Although evapotranspiration is a minor contributor of precipitation isotope variability, the impact of evapotranspiration on the enrichment of precipitation isotopes in autumn is a substantial control and should be considered, which makes a major contribution to compensate for the depletion in heavy isotopes of rainfall. The non-linear relationship between d-excess and ET0 was attributed to the variable contribution of large-scale convective moisture and local evaporation, as well as water vapor transfer processes. The response of precipitation stable isotopes to convective events was characterized by distinct stage patterns, associated with the water vapor sources and physical processes during rainout. The significant depletion of precipitation delta O-18 values during convective events was not due to the 'amount effect', but due to large-scale convection activity. These findings provide further insight into intraevent-scale isotopic variations associated with organized convection and their key influencing factors, which ultimately improves our interpretation of the paleoclimate records in subtropical monsoon regions.

AB Flood water infiltrates ephemeral channels, recharging local and regional aquifers, and it is the main water source in hyperarid regions. Quantitative estimations of these resources are limited by the scarcity of data from such regions. The floods of the Kuiseb River in the Namib Desert have been monitored for 46 years, providing a unique data set of flow hydrographs from one of the world's hyperarid regions. The study objectives were to: (1) subject the records to quality control; (2) model flood routing and transmission losses; and (3) study the relationships between flood characteristics, river characteristics and recharge into the aquifers. After rigorous quality-testing of the original gauge-station data, a flood-routing model based on kinematic flow with components accounting for channel-bed infiltration was constructed and applied to the data. A simplified module added to this routing model estimates aquifer recharge from the infiltrating flood water. Most of the model parameters were obtained from field surveys and GIS analyses. Two of the model parameters-Manning's roughness coefficient and the constant infiltration rate-were calibrated based on the high-quality measured flow data set, providing values of 0.025 and 8.5 mm/h, respectively. This infiltration rate is in agreement with that estimated from extensive direct TDR-based moisture measurements in the vadose zone under the Kuiseb River channel, and is low relative to those reported for other sites. The model was later verified with additional flood data and observed groundwater levels in boreholes. Sensitivity analysis showed the important role of large and medium floods in aquifer recharge. To generalize from the studied river to other streams with diverse conditions, we demonstrate that with increasing in infiltration rate, channel length or active channel width, the relative contribution of high-magnitude floods to recharge also increases, whereas medium and small floods contribute less, often not reaching the downstream parts of the and ephemeral river at all. For example, more than three-quarters of the floods reaching the downstream Kuiseb River (with an infiltration rate of 8.5 mm/h) would not have reached similar distances in rivers with all other properties similar but with infiltration rates of 50 mm/h. The recharge volume in the downstream segment in the case of higher infiltration is mainly contributed by floods with magnitude >= 93rd percentile, compared to floods in the 63rd percentile at an infiltration rate of 8.5 mm/h.

AB The water resources-water environment carrying capacity (WR-WECC) is an important indicator for judging the regional macro-control ability of water resources. The nature-based solutions (NBS) concept is related closely to sustainability, harmonious and green development, resources rational exploitation, coupled human and environment, and ecological protection priority. Participatory water management has necessitated the formation of village water resources committees and/or village environmental committees; while in the case of water management, a participatory approach has resulted in the formation of community water association, domestic water committees, cooperative societies, and various water user groups. The WR-WECC evaluation goal is to find the most appropriate water resources development and utilization to maximize benefits and system efficiency while minimizing costs and trade-offs. To realize the development and utilization of water resources, water ecological conservation, and water environment protection in Yuetang District, we constructed a dynamic evaluation index system including water resources, water environment and water ecological characteristics, applying the principal component analysis (PCA) method to evaluate the temporal scale variation tendency of WR-WECC, and explore a deep-seated reason based on NBS. The WR-WECC evaluation index system covered 16 indexes belonging to three subsystems of water resource, socioeconomic, and eco-environmental systems. We used Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) 19.0 software and adopted the improved PCA to integrate the urban economic-social-ecological development of the Xiangjiang (a tributary of the Yangtze River) River Basin. We applied the evaluation index system to analyse the trend variability of WR-WECC of Yuetang District from 2005 to 2015 based on NBS. The WR-WECC of Yuetang District was affected mainly by the urban sewage treatment rate, the water use amount per ten thousand Yuan gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita water resources. In addition to minor fluctuations in 2007 and 2011, the WR-WECC in Yuetang District was generally on the rise year by year and was related to socioeconomic development level, regional water environment comprehensive management, and awareness of water ecological protection. The WR-WECC of the Yuetang District in 2013-2015 was in a Class I (excellent) condition. The temporal variations analysis based on NBS was proposed through a combination of economic-social-ecological values provided by nature-based development and utilization patterns. Based on the relationship among regional water resources, economic society, and eco-environment protection, the paper supplied a WR-WECC improvement strategy that was suitable for the development and utilization of water resources in a water-rich area in south China.

AB Nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural areas poses a major challenge to the sustainability of water resources. Aquifer vulnerability models are useful tools that can help resource managers identify areas of concern, but quantifying nitrogen (N) inputs in such models is challenging, especially at large spatial scales. We sought to improve regional nitrate (NO3-) input functions by characterizing unsaturated zone NO3- transport to groundwater through use of surrogate, machine-learning metamodels of a process-based N flux model. The metamodels used boosted regression trees (BRTs) to relate mappable landscape variables to parameters and outputs of a previous "vertical flux method" (VFM) applied at sampled wells in the Fox, Wolf, and Peshtigo (FWP) river basins in northeastern Wisconsin. In this context, the metamodels upscaled the VFM results throughout the region, and the VFM parameters and outputs are the metamodel response variables. The study area encompassed the domain of a detailed numerical model that provided additional predictor variables, including groundwater recharge, to the metamodels. We used a statistical learning framework to test a range of model complexities to identify suitable hyperparameters of the six BRT meta models corresponding to each response variable of interest: NO source concentration factor (which determines the local NO input concentration); unsaturated zone travel time; NO3- concentration at the water table in 1980, 2000, and 2020 (three separate metamodels); and NO3- "extinction depth", the eventual steady state depth of the NO3- front. The final metamodels were trained to 129 wells within the active numerical flow model area, and considered 58 mappable predictor variables compiled in a geographic information system (GIS). These metamodels had training and cross-validation testing R-2 values of 0.52-0.86 and 0.22-0.38, respectively, and predictions were compiled as maps of the above response variables. Testing performance was reasonable, considering that we limited the metamodel predictor variables to mappable factors as opposed to using all available VFM input variables. Relationships between metamodel predictor variables and mapped outputs were generally consistent with expectations, e.g. with greater source concentrations and NO3- at the groundwater table in areas of intensive crop use and well drained soils. Shorter unsaturated zone travel times in poorly drained areas likely indicated preferential flow through clay soils, and a tendency for fine grained deposits to collocate with areas of shallower water table. Numerical estimates of groundwater recharge were important in the metamodels and may have been a proxy for N input and redox conditions in the northern FWP, which had shallow predicted NO3- extinction depth. The metamodel results provide proof-of-concept for regional characterization of unsaturated zone NO3- transport processes in a statistical framework based on readily mappable GIS input variables.

AB The focus of this study is an analysis of building vulnerability through investigating impacts from the 8 February 2013 flash flood event along the Avenida Venezuela channel in the city of Arequipa, Peru. On this day, 124.5 mm of rain fell within 3 h (monthly mean: 29.3 mm) triggering a flash flood that inundated at least 0.4 km(2) of urban settlements along the channel, affecting more than 280 buildings, 23 of a total of 53 bridges (pedestrian, vehicle and railway), and leading to the partial collapse of sections of the main road, paralyzing central parts of the city for more than one week.
   This study assesses the aspects of building design and site specific environmental characteristics that render a building vulnerable by considering the example of a flash flood event in February 2013. A statistical methodology is developed that enables estimation of damage probability for buildings. The applied method uses observed inundation height as a hazard proxy in areas where more detailed hydrodynamic modeling data is not available. Building design and site-specific environmental conditions determine the physical vulnerability. The mathematical approach considers both physical vulnerability and hazard related parameters and helps to reduce uncertainty in the determination of descriptive parameters, parameter interdependency and respective contributions to damage. This study aims to (1) enable the estimation of damage probability for a certain hazard intensity, and (2) obtain data to visualize variations in damage susceptibility for buildings in flood prone areas. Data collection is based on a post-flood event field survey and the analysis of high (sub-metric) spatial resolution images (Pleiades 2012, 2013). An inventory of 30 city blocks was collated in a GIS database in order to estimate the physical vulnerability of buildings. As many as 1103 buildings were surveyed along the affected drainage and 898 buildings were included in the statistical analysis. Univariate and bivariate analyses were applied to better characterize each vulnerability parameter. Multiple corresponding analyses revealed strong relationships between the "Distance to channel or bridges", "Structural building type", "Building footprint" and the observed damage. Logistic regression enabled quantification of the contribution of each explanatory parameter to potential damage, and determination of the significant parameters that express the damage susceptibility of a building. The model was applied 200 times on different calibration and validation data sets in order to examine performance. Results show that 90% of these tests have a success rate of more than 67%. Probabilities (at building scale) of experiencing different damage levels during a future event similar to the 8 February 2013 flash flood are the major outcomes of this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Springs in the Furnace Creek area (Texas, Travertine, and Nevares Springs) of Death Valley National Park exhibit high discharge rates and depleted delta O-18(VSMOW) (similar to - 13 parts per thousand) and delta D-VSMOW (similar to - 102 parts per thousand) values. Isotopic depletion of this magnitude and large spring fluxes (similar to 10,000 L/min) suggests that modem local recharge in the and Furnace Creek drainage cannot be responsible for spring fluxes. An alternate explanation, interbasin flow, is difficult to envisage due to the stratigraphic and structural relationships of bedrock in intervening ranges, although it is the most common conceptual model for Furnace Creek spring flows.
   High-flux springs at Furnace Creek nonetheless respond modestly to modem climate in terms of discharge rate and isotopic composition. Hydrographs show a climate response and variations in time-series stable isotope data of widely spaced springs track one another. Small, but measurable quantities of tritium ( < 0.2 TU) were found at Nevares Spring, also suggesting a component of modem recharge. Thus, whatever the main source of water for these springs may be, there appears to be a subtle, but recent climatic influence.
   Estimates of flow at nearby mountain springs produce discharge rates per square kilometer of catchment that, by analogy, could support from 20 to 300% of the flow at large Death Valley springs under the current climate. Yet, C-14 model ages suggest valley-bottom springs at Furnace Creek (5500-14,500 yr) contain a large component of older water, suggesting that much of the water was recharged during a pluvial period (Younger Dryas?) when net infiltration would have been much higher and isotopically depleted. C-14 model ages are also of similar age, or younger, than many 'up gradient' waters, rather than being older as would be expected for interbasin flow. Chemical evolution models of solutes are consistent with both local recharge and interbasin transfer from Ash Meadows. However, when considered with isotopic constraints, interbasin flow becomes obviously untenable.
   Estimates of the thickness of alluvium and semi-consolidated Tertiary units in the Furnace Creek drainage seem to provide adequate storage, confinement, and upward leakage to accommodate current discharge. Thus, although Death Valley is the ultimate discharge location for regional groundwaters in terms of potential, careful study of these springs suggests that most of their flux is supported by local pluvial recharge, suggesting that a careful re-evaluation of the interbasin transfers be conducted on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, regional flow models that are built on the concept of interbasin flow provide boundary flux conditions for site-scale models for the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Thus, site-scale models may over-predict the potential transport of waste from the Yucca Mountain facility. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Submarine groundwater discharges (SGD) play a major role in solute transport and nutrient flux to the ocean. We have conducted a spatio-temporal high-resolution lunar-tidal cycle-scale seepage meter experiment during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, to quantify the spatio-temporal patterns and variability of SGD, its terrestrial (T-SGD) and marine components (M-SGD). The measured daily average SGD rates range from no discharge to 3.6 m(3) m(-2) d(-1) during pre-monsoon season and 0.08-5.9 m(3) m(-2) d(-1) during post-monsoon seasons, depending on the tidal pattern. The uncertainty for SGD measurement is calculated as +/- 0.8% to +/- 11% for pre-monsoon and +/- 1.8% to +/- 17% for post-monsoon respectively. A linear, inverse relationship was observed between the calculated T-SGD and M-SGD components, which varied along the distance from the coast and position in the tidal-cycle, spatial and temporal (daily) variations of seepage rates within the lunar tidal cycle period distinctly demonstrate the influence of tides on groundwater seepage rate. As an instance, for the identification of the bulk discharge location, the centroid of the integrated SGD rate has been calculated and found to be near 20 m offshore area. The average discharge rate per unit area further extrapolated to total SGD fluxes to the Bay of Bengal from eastern Indian coast by extrapolation of the annual and seasonal fluxes observed in the study area, which are first direct/experimental estimate of SGD to the Bay of Bengal. Approximations suggest that in present-day condition, total average annual SGD to the Bay of Bengal is about 8.98 +/- 0.6 x 10(8) m(3)/y. This is suggested that the SGD input to the ocean through the Bay of Bengal is approximately 0.9% of the global input from the inter-tidal zone and that has an implication on the mass balance of discharging solutes/nutrients to the global oceans. High T-SGD input is observed for all season, which is largest toward landward direction from the delineated saltwater-freshwater interface. The high magnitude of T-SGD could play an important role in mass balance of fresh water discharge and solute transport to the global ocean, thereby influence coastal ecohydrological systems.

AB Empirical relationships were derived to describe the climatic control of stomatal conductance for four of the most common species of the HAPEX-Sahel study area. These species included a Ct shrub (Guiera senegalensis), a C-3 forb (Mitracarpus scaber), a C-4 grass (Digitario gayanus) and the most common crop of the area, millet (Pennisetum glaucum), which is also a C, species. For all four species the controlling climate variables were photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and soil water potential, and their responses to these variables differed in a manner that was consistent with their different photosynthetic physiologies. Air temperature was not found to be a significant variable.
   Canopy average stomatal conductances ((g) over bar(s)) were estimated from leaf-level measurements and then modelled in this paper. By relating the distribution of leaf-level stomatal conductances to light attenuation through the canopy it was shown that total PAR intercepted by the canopy, divided by leaf area index (LAI) (i.e. average PAR interception), can be used to estimate (g) over bar(s) to a good approximation of the non-linear canopy integral as long as LAI variation in the measurements is small (e.g. less than 1.0). This assumes that the other environmental variables are constant through the canopy, but is significant in that it simplifies the procedure for the estimation of (g) over bar(s) and canopy conductance (g(c)).
   The values of (g) over bar(s) were limited by PAR availability for brief periods at sunrise and sunset and, for the two C-4 species, there was evidence that shading within the canopy reduced the average values. However, the strongest diurnal variation was correlated with the increase in VPD, associated with increasing air temperature, which resulted in decreasing conductances during most of the day, following the peak in the early morning. The long-term decline in stomatal conductances following the last rainfall was associated with increasingly negative soil water potential. G. senegalensis retained its leaves through December with low but measurable stomatal conductances. Canopy conductances (g(c)) were estimated from (g) over bar(s) and leaf area. Maximum values of g(c) occurred near the end of the rains, when environmental conditions were still near optimum and LAI was high.

AB Differential dynamic programming is used to compute optimal time-varying pumping policies for a pump and treat strategy for groundwater remediation. The feedback law generated by a constrained differential dynamic programming algorithm with penalty functions is used as the basis of feedback laws tested in cases where there is uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity. Confined transient aquifer flow and transport are modeled using a two-dimensional Galerkin finite element scheme with implicit time differencing. Optimal policies are calculated using a given or ''measured'' set of hydraulic conductivities and initial conditions. The optimal policies (with and without feedback) are applied using the same finite element model with a second or ''true'' set of conductivities. The ''true'' sets of conductivities are generated randomly from an autocorrelated lognormal distribution by the spectral method. The approach used here has an advantage over other uncertainty approaches because it is not necessary to specify precisely which parameters are considered uncertain and which are certain. Also no single probability distribution need be assumed for each uncertain parameter. By adjusting the relative weight assigned each penalty function, robust feedback laws were obtained that perform equally well under nine different assumed error distributions. In our examples, well-designed feedback policies cost between 4% and 51% less than the cost of applying the calculated optimal policies without using a feedback law.

AB A pilot study was carried out in the Matsi spring fen, southern Estonia to test a proposed methodology (Terasmaa et al., 2020) for identifying potential effects of groundwater bodies on groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems (GDTE). A comprehensive hydrochemical and isotopic dataset was collected and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods to assess the origin of the groundwater discharging in the spring fen and to determine both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of GDTE-groundwater interdependence. The hydrochemical findings were complemented with the hydrogeological, hydrodynamical and botanical observations, and summarized into a conceptual model of the study site. The results show that the status of the spring fen is influenced both by groundwater inflow from the regional Middle Devonian sandstone aquifer (D(2)gj-ar) in the transboundary Gauja/Koiva River basin, but also by discharge of the shallow aquifer found in Quaternary (Q) deposits of local extent. By using multivariate statistical methods, the mixing of the two main groundwater sources in the spring fen discharge was quantified. On average, the regional D(2)gj-ar and local Q aquifer contributed 67% and 33%, respectively, to the spring fen discharge. The groundwater was generally more mineralized in the D(2)gj-ar aquifer while more nutrient-rich in the shallow Q aquifer. Agricultural activities in the arable lands adjacent to the spring fen have resulted in the elevated loads of macronutrients and halogens in the shallow Q aquifer (N-tot=1.95 +/- 2.6 mg N/l, P-tot=0.59 +/- 0.8 mg P/l). Although generally in pristine state, the elevated macronutrient loading from the Q aquifer and perhaps the beaver activity, has led to deterioration of the status of the spring fen communities in the upstream parts of the main fen polygon. The N:P ratios were occasionally above the 16:1, indicating nitrogen limitation and phosphorus excess, which is likely due to increased upland loading of phosphorus from fertilizers. The results of the study show that poor chemical status of a GDTE can result from local pollution sources and land-use even in cases when the related regional GW body itself is in good chemical status. Also, the usefulness of analyzing minor groundwater components (e.g Ba, Sr, Al, F, SiO2) in a GDTE assessment in establishing the end-member mixing relationships has been shown. All in all, it is one of the first comprehensive studies of the interactions between a groundwater body and a groundwater-dependent terrestrial ecosystem in the Estonian context.

AB Soil erosion is a serious threat for cultivated soils on steep slopes under tropical conditions. In Costa Rica, coffee plantations are widespread on such steep slopes in several basins used for hydroelectric generation, which are affected by soil erosion and sedimentation in dam reservoirs. For this study, surface runoff and soil loss rate were measured during three years on large experimental plots installed within a coffee field on a steep slope (60% average). The time interval for rainfall and runoff measurements was 5 min. A simple infiltration model presented by Diskin and Nazimov (1995) was used to estimate runoff during a rainfall event showing the relevance of initial soil water content in order to estimate runoff base on rainfall intensity variations. Three complementary embedded time scales were analyzed: annual-monthly, event and intra-event. The rainy seasons included 581 rainfall events giving a total depth of 2206, 1778 and 2220 mm in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. Total runoff was 103 +/- 55, 54 +/- 14 and 33 +/- 6.4 mm in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. Annual average sediment concentration was about 1.3 +/- 0.3 g l(-1) with reduced temporal variations between years or rainfall events. The total soil loss was 1686 +/- 784, 914 +/- 306 and 575 +/- 140 kg ha(-1) for 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. Around 60% of rainfall and 90% of runoff and soil loss respectively came from the August-October period and more than half of it from October. Total rainfall event and soil water content explained most of surface runoff and soil loss dynamics at three time scales analyzed. Inherited soil water storage from previous year played an important role on the relationship between rainfall and runoff dynamics the following year. Soil and coffee coverage did not have a significant effect on runoff and soil loss variability due to permanently good soil coverage (even in the rainy season). This good coverage over the rainy season prevented crust development. The presence of old micro-terraces helped to reduce runoff and sediment loss. The Diskin and Nazimov model demonstrated that a combination of rainfall intensity and soil water content dynamics on an intra-event scale explained better the differences observed in runoff and soil loss on an interevent scale. Runoff at intra event scale had high and low runoff moments depending on rainfall intensity and superficial soil layer water status and saturation of deeper layers under long rainfall events.

AB Principles of optimality provide an interesting alternative to modeling hydrological processes in detail on small scales and have received growing interest in the last years. Inspired by the more than 20 years old concept of minimum energy dissipation in river networks, we present a corresponding theory for subsurface flow in order to obtain a better understanding of preferential flow patterns in the subsurface. The concept describes flow patterns which are optimal in the sense of minimizing the total energy dissipation at a given recharge under the constraint of a given total porosity. Results are illustrated using two examples: two-dimensional flow towards a spring with a radial symmetric distribution of the porosity and dendritic flow patterns. The latter are found to be similar to river networks in their structure and, as a main result, the model predicts a power-law distribution of the spring discharges. In combination with two data sets from the Austrian Alps, this result is used for validating the model. Both data sets reveal power-law-distributed spring discharges with similar scaling exponents. These are, however, slightly larger than the exponent predicted by the model. As a further result, the distributions of the residence times strongly differ between homogeneous porous media and optimized flow patterns, while the mean residence times are similar in both cases.

AB Analyzing temporal and spatial variability of river discharge and the impacts of large-scale climate oscillations on hydrological systems are of particular interest in Alpine catchments, which have been proved to be especially sensitive to climatic drivers. The impact of climate oscillation indexes may show a delayed response and therefore the correlation between climatic drivers and streamflow is challenging to be properly identified. For this purpose, wavelet transform (WT) is recognized as a suitable tool able to determine the crucial scales of variability. In this work, first we explore the periodicities and the coherence among several climatic indexes: North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO), Mediterranean Oscillation Index (MO), Greenland Blocking Index (GB), and Artic Oscillation Index (AO). This analysis shows the complementary information that different oscillation indexes provide and the need to consider their impacts on streamflow simultaneously. Previous work revealed a heterogeneous and complex response of the Inn river basin at long temporal scales, which could not be linked to analyzed anthropogenic impacts such as dams' construction and hydropower plants operation. Therefore, the trigger of changes in streamflow variability remained unclear. In this study, we elaborate a classification based on all considered indexes' coherence with fifty gauging stations of the Inn river catchment. We quantify simi-larity among stations with a focus on yearly and longer temporal scales. The results highlight the heterogeneous response of the streamflow towards changes in climatic indexes and give an overview of the possible drivers of detected long-term alterations. NAO and GB extreme phases are connected with cold winters and hot summers. We observe that from the 1980s changes detected in the streamflow behavior at yearly and longer temporal scales are in line with emerging patterns of the climatic indexes, such as the shift from constant to intermittent periodicities of the MO index. AO coherence displays a higher complexity able to capture singular hydrologic behaviors (i.e., particular hydrological regime only detected for one gauging station, often connected to high altitude small basins). From the cluster analysis we can also derive how mean catchment elevation and geographical location can contribute to the explanation of the influence and teleconnection to the oscillation indexes, while glacierized area is not identified as a dominant characteristic. Thus, this research contributes to a better understanding of streamflow variability over the Eastern Alps, and the role of teleconnection patterns on this variability. These relationships can be also used to improve hydrological forecasting and water resources management in the Alpine region.

AB Few studies have fully considered how hydrological inputs and climate influence the linkage between the oxygen isotopic composition of alpha-cellulose (delta O-18(cell)) and their source waters in vascular-plant-dominated alpine peatlands. In this study, in order to test whether delta O-18(cell) can be used as a hydroclimatic indicator, we investigated the relationship between the delta O-18 values of cellulose extracted from the dominant plant species (Carex pamirensis) and those of potential source waters during two growing seasons (from May to September) in the Sahara sand peatland in the southern Altai Mountains. Concurrently, the Roden-Lin-Ehleringer (RLE) mechanistic model was applied to better understand oxygen isotopic fractionation during cellulose synthesis. We found that the meltwater from snow/ice cover and seasonally-frozen soil played a critical role in controlling the hydrological processes in this alpine peatland. The delta O-18 values of both swale water and soil water responded more sensitively to variations in inflow meltwater than did summer precipitation. IsoSource modelling demonstrated that the mean 76-24% split between meltwater and summer precipitation inputs determined the overall isotopic composition of the peatland water. The slopes of the peatland water line (6.38) and meltwater line (6.87) were slightly lower than that of the local meteoric water line (LMWL) (7.72), suggesting limited evaporation from these external water sources due to the relatively high humidity (73-80%) in the studied fen. However, the slopes of the stem water line (4.53) and leaf water line (157) were generally lower than that of the LMWL, indicating that the internal plant waters have experienced isotopic enrichment during transpiration. Interestingly, the variations of delta O-18(cell) (of shoots, stems and leaves) fall within a relatively narrow range ( < +/- 3 parts per thousand), which is mainly attributed to a nearly constant monthly net O-18 enrichment factor (11.13 +/- 1.07 parts per thousand for Delta(Modelled)), together with a smoothing effect. Furthermore, empirical correlation and RLE modeling both showed the co-variation of external source water and cellulose synthesis, demonstrating that the cellulose oxygen isotope composition of C. pamirensis can faithfully reflect variations in soil/swale water. These findings strongly suggest that inflow meltwater is the dominant water source in determining delta O-18(cell), implying that the delta O-18(p) signals of precipitation in the winter half-year (October-April) may be inherited by the delta O-18(cell) values of C. pamirensis at the study site. Therefore, our results provide important insights for the hydroclimatic interpretation of past variations in delta O-18(cell) values in vascular plants in alpine peatlands.

AB Acid rain has the potential to significantly impact the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from soil to groundwater. Yet, to date, the effects of acid rain have not been investigated in karstic systems, which are expected to strongly buffer the pH of atmospheric rainfall. This study presents a nine-year DOM fluorescence dataset from a karst unsaturated zone collected from two drip sites (HS4, HS6) in Heshang Cave, southern China between 2005 and 2014. Cross-correlograms show that fluorescence intensity of both dripwaters lagged behind rainfall by similar to 1 year (similar to 11 months lag for HS4, and similar to 13 months for HS6), whereas drip rates responded quite quickly to rainfall (0 months lag for HS4, and similar to 3 months for HS6), based on optimal correlation coefficients. The rapid response of drip rates to rainfall is related to the change of reservoir head pressure in summer, associated with higher rainfall. In winter, low rainfall has a limited effect on head pressure, and drip rates gradually slow to a constant value associated with base flow from the overlying reservoir- this effect being most evident on inter annual timescales (R-2 = 0.80 for HS4 and R-2 = 0.86 for HS6, n = 9, p < 0.01). We ascribed the 1 year lag of fluorescence intensity to the effect of the soil moisture deficit and the karst process on delaying water and solute transport. After eliminating the one year lag, the congruent seasonal pacing and amplitude between fluorescence intensity and rainfall observed suggests that the seasonality of fluorescence intensity was mainly controlled by the monsoonal rains which can govern the output of DOM from the soil, as well as the residence time of water in the unsaturated zone. On inter-annual timescales, a robust linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and annual (effective) precipitation amount (R-2 = 0.86 for HS4 and R-2 = 0.77 for HS6, n = 9, p < 0.01) was identified, implying that annual (effective) precipitation is the main determinant of DOM concentration in the aquifer. Conversely, the insensitivity of fluorescence intensity and fluorescence wavelength maxima to variations in the pH of local rainfall suggests that acid rain over the study period (pH 5.6 to 4.5) had no discernable effect on the quantity and quality of DOM in karst soil and soil solution, likely being strongly buffered by soil carbonates. Therefore, despite large increases in anthropogenic acid rain in recent Chinese history, hydrologic forcing is the predominant factor driving variations in DOM in karst aquifers.

AB With global warming and aggravation due to human activities, many lakes on Earth are facing a series of worsening environmental problems, such as shrinking areas and declining water quality. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, an important wetland in the world and the largest migratory bird habitat in Asia. The ecological environment of the lake has a widespread influence and has attracted international attention. It is necessary to use long-term frequent satellite observations to investigate the Poyang Lake due to its high-frequency fluctuations characteristics. However, most remote sensing data cover only a short period of time, which cannot reflect the long-term change to the Poyang Lake water, no satellite mission currently fits such requirements. Based on HJ-1A/B and Landsat data from 1989 to 2018, the dynamic changes in water quantity in Poyang Lake are monitored in this paper, and the influencing factors and ecological impacts of the changes are analyzed. The results show that in terms of the water area change trend, on the annual scale, the annual mean values of water area and water volume exhibit overall decreasing trends. The water area was the largest in 1998 at 4068.33 km(2) and smallest in 2014 at 899.68 km(2); the water volume was largest in 1992 at 25,810 million m(3) and smallest in 2014 at 5880 million m(3). On the monthly scale, the water area was the smallest in January, largest in July, and showed an increasing trend from January to July; subsequently, a decreasing trend was observed from August to January. The water volume was smallest in February, largest in July, and showed an increasing trend from February to July; then, a decreasing trend was observed from August to February. The water volume of Poyang Lake is affected by seasonal changes in precipitation, and the correlation coefficient between monthly precipitation and monthly water volume is 0.603 (P < 0.05). In summer, the water volume is affected by the water level in the Yangtze River; the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River caused a prolonged duration of the low water period and an advanced low water period, which are also important factors affecting the water volume change. In terms of the impact of water volume on ecology, the relationship between water volume and NH3-N concentration is obvious, with a correlation coefficient of - 0.679 (P < 0.01). A large water volume will increase the lake water level, reduce the habitats for migratory birds, and provide food to fewer migratory birds.

AB Most of the once ecologically valuable and widespread peatlands in Western Europe as well as in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (North-Eastern Germany) have been drained in the course of the intensification of agricultural land use. Peat degradation and mineralisation frequently caused high nitrate-nitrogen (NO3- -N) tosses, white re-wetting may lead to elevated phosphorus concentrations in the Porewater. High concentrations of NO3--N and other solutes in a ditch draining a catchment (85 ha) dominated by degraded peatland under intensive grassland use gave reason to investigate the relationship between the spatial and temporal variability of the shallow groundwater quality on the one hand and soil properties, topography and hydrological dynamics on the other hand. Therefore, in addition to the ditch, three transects of dipwells were sampled and soil samples were taken along the transects at a high spatial resolution. Soil organic carbon C-org and total nitrogen N-t contents varied considerably from 0.8% to 40.9% and 0.08% to 2.87%, respectively. A trend surface analysis (TSA) of these soil properties showed a strong trend depending on the ground elevation and the distance to the adjacent drainage ditch, reflecting both a transition from mineral to organic soils and differences in peat formation and degradation connected to the topography and, consequently, to the depth to the groundwater table. Semivariogram analysis was performed using the normally distributed residuals of the TSA and showed for each transect a strong spatial dependence and short (5-26 m) ranges. If possible, soil sampling in peatlands should be conducted at short distance sampling intervals. The patterns of groundwater solute concentrations were complex. They were spatially and temporally very variable between as welt as within the transects, thus proving that a few groundwater samples are insufficient for a representative characterisation of the peatland status and for an evaluation of possible environmental impacts or potential consequences of re-wetting. Groundwater concentrations ranged from 0 to 65.4 mg l(-1) NO3--N and 0-1.95 mg l(-1) P-t, while during the same period, ditch water concentrations of 0-15.9 mg l(-1) NO3--N and 0.05 to 0.44 mg l(-1) P-t, respectively, were measured. Factor analysis of groundwater concentrations, topographical data, hydrological conditions and soil properties led to the identification of five factors explaining up to 80% of the observed variance of the data: (i) topography and soil chemical properties, (ii) biogeochemical processes, (iii) drainage effects, (iv) climatic effects and (v) dilution effects.

AB Numerical models that solve governing equations for subsurface fluid flow and transport are commonly applied to analyze quantitatively the effects of heterogeneity. These models require maps of spatially variable hydraulic properties. Because complete three-dimensional information about hydraulic properties is never obtainable, numerous methods have been developed to interpolate between data values and use geologic, hydrogeologic, and geophysical information to create images of aquifer properties. Image creation approaches fall into three general categories: structure-imitating. process-imitating, and descriptive. Structure-imitating methods rely on one or more of the following to constrain the geometry of spatial patterns in geologic media: correlated random fields, probabilistic rules, and deterministic constraints developed from facies relations. Structure-imitating methods include spatial statistical algorithms and geologically based sedimentation pattern-matching approaches. Process-imitating models include aquifer model calibration methods and geologic process models. Aquifer model calibration methods use governing equations for subsurface fluid flow and transport to relate hydraulic properties to heads and solute information through history and steady state data matching. Geologic process models combine fundamental laws of conservation of mass and momentum with sediment transport equations to simulate spatial patterns in grain size distributions, At the sedimentary basin scale, multiprocess models include thermomechanical mechanisms of basin subsidence. Descriptive methods couple geologic observations with facies relations to divide an aquifer into zones of characteristic hydraulic properties. All approaches are capable of reproducing heterogeneity over a range of scales and considering some types of geologic information. Some approaches are strictly spatial while some are linked to the time evolution of sedimentation. Some approaches can be conditioned on measurements. Recent advances aimed at infusing geologic information into images of the subsurface include extracting more information from sedimentological facies models, incorporating qualitative geologic information into random field generators and simulating depositional processes. Classes of research missing from the literature include multiprocess models that incorporate diagenesis and three-dimensional surface water flow, hybrid methods that combine features of existing approaches, and approaches that can make use of all available geologic, geophysical, and hydrologic data.

AB A Cosmic-Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) is a promising tool for obtaining reliable intermediate scale soil moisture. Although there are sound ways of correcting neutron counts and calibrating soil moisture, it is difficult to obtain all the data required for corrections and calibration in a complex environment. In this study, three major correcting variables (i.e., absolute humidity, air pressure, incoming neutron flux intensity) were evaluated to determine their impacts on the neutron counts in the Seolmacheon experimental site (SMC) located in mountainous terrain. Efficiency of correction factors for atmospheric water vapor (f(wv)), air pressure (f(p),), and incoming neutron flux intensity (f(i)) was independently assessed through comparisons between the variables and a inversely calculated N-0 (N-0,N-inv). Particular attention was given to the expected biases and errors in estimated soil moisture (SMCRNP) with and without each correction factor, especially at the early stage of the calibration period. Air pressure had the greatest impact on neutron count at the SMC site, followed by absolute humidity. The dependency of neutron count on air pressure (absolute humidity) was found from the inverse relationship with N-0, inv that is not corrected for air pressure (absolute humidity), with correlation coefficient -0.88 (-0.78). When f(p) (f(wv)) was applied, the dependency of neutron count on the corresponding variable was significantly reduced, with a correlation coefficient 0.06 (-0.07). On the other hand, the effect of applying f(i) was contrary, slightly degrading the result. When neutron count was not corrected for air pressure (absolute humidity), the performance of SMCRNP decreased, with a correlation coefficient of 0.74 (0.90) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.030 m(3)/m(3) (0.026 m(3)/m(3)) at best. The best result was obtained when both of them were corrected (r = 0.95, RMSE = 0.014 m(3)/m(3)). As data accumulates, error metrics in terms of bias and variability converged at approximately one periodic cycle, implying at least one seasonal cycle is necessary for recalibration. However, in a case where a variable with large intra-seasonal variability (e.g., air pressure in this study) is missing, it is recommended to adopt a multi-point N-0 method.
   The procedures suggested in this study allow independent evaluations of the factors for which neutron count is corrected, thus providing a basis for judging which factors are appropriate and which are not. In addition, N-0 can be more efficiently tuned according to the characteristics of the errors in SMCRNP. Based on these analyses, CRNP stations will be able to selectively apply favorable correction factors under various kinds of local characteristics, making it easier to achieve target accuracy and precision.

AB This study evaluates the relationship between two indicators of climate variability - sea surface temperatures (SST) and 500-mbar geopotential height (Z(500)) - and seasonal streamflows i.e., spring-summer (March to August), spring (March to May), and summer (June to August) of the continental United States. 240 unimpaired streamflow stations in the continental United States, categorized by hydrologic regions, are analyzed for a 60 year period from 1950 to 2010. Statistical approach comprising of singular value decomposition is used to evaluate the spatio-temporal association between fall (September to November from 1950 to 2009) and winter (December to February from 1950 to 2009) SST and Z(500), and the continental U.S. seasonal streamflow. Influences of the interdecadal-warm and cold phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) were also evaluated. Regions of highly correlated SST and Z(500) were identified that did not have the bias of conservative index regions. Better seasonal variability in streamflow was represented by Z(500), compared to SST. Pacific SST had strong correlations with the Midwest, southern South-Atlantic-Gulf, and Pacific Northwest regions, whereas the Atlantic SST had strong correlations with New England, South-Atlantic-Gulf, and Upper and Lower Colorado regions. Stronger correlation of the Pacific and Atlantic Z(500) were noticed with the Midwest, New England, Souris-Red-Rainy, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf regions. Interdecadal-temporal evaluation of the phases of the PDO and AMO showed variations in SST regions influencing streamflows and weakening of teleconnections. There were strong correlations of PDO warm phases with most of California, Upper and Lower Colorado, and South-Atlantic-Gulf regions; the PDO cold phases had correlations with Pacific Northwest, eastern Ohio, and South-Atlantic-Gulf regions. The warm phase of AMO showed correlations with Midwest, Souris-Red-Rainy, Upper Mississippi, Arkansas-White-Red, and Texas-Gulf region; the AMO cold phase showed correlations with Upper and Lower Colorado, Midwest, eastern U.S., and South-Atlantic-Gulf. The El Nino Southern Oscillation region 3.4, 3 as well as regions in the central and north tropical Pacific Ocean had strong associations with U.S. streamflow. The hydroclimatic associations identified through the current study may be used to improve streamflow predictability and enhance management of streamflow volumes, several months in advance.

AB The Ethiopian Highlands are subjected to important land degradation. Though spatial variability of rain depth is important, even at the catchment scale, this variability has never been studied. In addition, little is known on rain erosivity for this part of the world. The objectives of this study are (a) to assess the spatial variation of rain in a 80 km(2) mountain area (2100-2800 m a.s.l.) in the Northern Tigray region, and how this variation is influenced by topography, geographical position and lithology, (b) to analyse the temporal variations and (c) to quantify rain erosivity and the different factors determining it, such as rain intensity, drop size and kinetic energy.
   Spatial variation of rain was measured over a 6-y period by installing 16 rain gauges in the study area. Topographical factors, especially general orientation of the valley and slope gradient over longer distances, determine the spatial distribution of annual rain, which is in the order of 700 mm y(-1). Precipitation is highest nearby cliffs and other eminent slopes, perpendicular to the main valleys which are preferred flow paths for the air masses.
   Rain intensity is smaller than expected: 88% falls with an intensity < 30 mm h(-1). High intensities have a short duration; maximum recorded rain depth over I h (32 mm) is only 2 mm less than that over 24 It. Using the blotting paper method 65,100 rain drops were sampled. For all observed rain intensities, the median volume drop diameters (D-50) are significantly larger than those reported for other regions of the world. A relation between rain intensity (I) and volume specific kinetic energy (Ek(vol)) was developed for the Ethiopian Highlands:
   Ek(vol) = 36.65(1 - (0.6/1)) (R-2 = 0.99, n = 18), (Ek(vol) in J m(-2)mm(-1), I in min h(-) (1)).
   Due to the occurrence of large drop sizes, probably linked to the prevailing semi-arid to subhumid mountain climate, this relation yields, within the intensity range [0.6-84 mm h(-1)], larger values for Ek(vol) than elsewhere in the world.
   It is recommended to use this new relationship for calculating Ek(vol) of rain in the Ethiopian Highlands, as well as for the computation of Universal Soil Loss Equation's rain erosivity factor on yearly basis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Invasive trees in catchments around the world are a source of concern due to their hydrological and ecological impacts. A large number of studies have focused on their impact on dry-season stream discharge due to enhanced transpiration. The impact of invasive trees on stream discharge and flood risk during extreme rain events, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change, has not been addressed adequately. We examined the in-fluence of land-cover, canopy cover, and other catchment morphological characteristics on stream discharges in hilly catchments during light, heavy, and extreme rain events. Three years of rainfall-runoff observations, be-tween January 2014 and December 2016, were collected in eleven neighbouring mountainous catchments in Nilgiris, South India. Each catchment had a distinct land cover, namely shola forests, montane grasslands, and catchments invaded by wattle (Acacia mearnsii). Hourly rain intensities between the percentiles 25-90, 90-95 and over 95 were categorised as light, heavy and extreme respectively, and were used to study hourly peak stream discharge responses. We compared discharge between native grassland catchments and grassland catchments invaded by wattle. Discharge rates were corrected for the catchment area. We found that land cover and canopy-cover influenced the hydrologic response to extreme rain events. Regression models with flood event as the response variable suggested an increase in rainfall-runoff response with an increase in canopy cover. The maximum hourly discharge observed in the reference grassland catchment (0.00098 mm s-1) was lower than the maximum discharge observed in low density (0.00529 mm s-1) and high density (0.00497 mm s-1) wattle catchments. At higher discharges, the flood magnitude in wattle invaded catchments was much greater than that in the grassland catchment for a given flood frequency - indicating a higher risk of severe flooding in wattle-dominated catchments. We attribute the enhanced flood discharges to the effects of spreading wattle roots on the enhancement of rapid, shallow sub-surface flows in invaded catchments. Catchments dominated by shallow sub-surface flows are known to have reduced water retention times in response to high rain intensities. Ante-cedent moisture conditions and drainage density were other factors that influenced the local rainfall-runoff relationships. In the Western Ghats and other parts of India grasslands have been planted with exotic woody trees, and some have become invasive. Our study indicates that replacing grasslands with woody plants at landscape scales, could affect hydrological processes and could increase flood risks during the monsoon, espe-cially in mountainous regions. Management of invaded catchments by regulation of wattle and restoration of semi-natural grassland, combined with the installation of early warning systems in these impacted areas will help reduce flood risk during extreme rain under climate change.

AB This work is the fifth in a series of papers on the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) approach for modeling flow and transport phenomena in multiscale porous medium systems. The general TCAT framework and the mathematical foundation presented in previous works are used to develop models that describe species transport and single-fluid-phase flow through a porous medium system in varying physical regimes. Classical irreversible thermodynamics formulations for species in fluids, solids, and interfaces are developed. Two different approaches are presented, one that makes use of a momentum equation for each entity along with constitutive relations for species diffusion and dispersion, and a second approach that makes use of a momentum equation for each species in an entity. The alternative models are developed by relying upon different approaches to constrain an entropy inequality using mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations. The resultant constrained entropy inequality is simplified and used to guide the development of closed models. specific instances of dilute and non-dilute systems are examined and compared to alternative formulation approaches.

AB This work is the seventh in a series that introduces and employs the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) for modeling flow and transport in multiscale porous medium systems. This paper expands the previous analyses in the series by developing models at a scale where spatial variations within the system are not considered. Thus the time variation of variables averaged over the entire system is modeled in relation to fluxes at the boundary of the system. This implementation of TCAT makes use of conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy as well as an entropy balance. Additionally, classical irreversible thermodynamics is assumed to hold at the microscale and is averaged to the megascale, or system scale. The fact that the local equilibrium assumption does not apply at the megascale points to the importance of obtaining closure relations that account for the large-scale manifestation of small-scale variations. Example applications built on this foundation are suggested to stimulate future work. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Combination of radar and daily precipitation data to estimate meaningful
   sub-daily point precipitation extremes
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Precipitation; Radar; Disaggregation
ID MODEL
AB The use of radar measurements for the space time estimation of precipitation has for many decades been a central topic in hydro-meteorology. In this paper we are interested specifically in daily and sub-daily extreme values of precipitation at gauged or ungauged locations which are important for design. The purpose of the paper is to develop a methodology to combine daily precipitation observations and radar measurements to estimate sub-daily extremes at point locations. Radar data corrected using precipitation-reflectivity relationships lead to biased estimations of extremes. Different possibilities of correcting systematic errors using the daily observations are investigated. Observed gauged daily amounts are interpolated to unsampled points and subsequently disaggregated using the sub-daily values obtained by the radar. Different corrections based on the spatial variability and the subdaily entropy of scaled rainfall distributions are used to provide unbiased corrections of short duration extremes. Additionally a statistical procedure not based on a matching day by day correction is tested. In this last procedure as we are only interested in rare extremes, low to medium values of rainfall depth were neglected leaving a small number of L days of ranked daily maxima in each set per year, whose sum typically comprises about 50% of each annual rainfall total. The sum of these L day maxima is first iterpolated using a Kriging procedure. Subsequently this sum is disaggregated to daily values using a nearest neighbour procedure. The daily sums are then disaggregated by using the relative values of the biggest L radar based days. Of course, the timings of radar and gauge maxima can be different, so the method presented here uses radar for disaggregating daily gauge totals down to 15 min intervals in order to extract the maxima of sub-hourly through to daily rainfall.
   The methodologies were tested in South Africa, where an S-band radar operated relatively continuously at Bethlehem from 1998 to 2003, whose scan at 1.5 km above ground [CAPPI] overlapped a dense (10 km spacing) set of 45 pluviometers recording in the same 6-year period. This valuable set of data was obtained from each of 37 selected radar pixels [1 km square in plan] which contained a pluviometer not masked out by the radar foot-print. The pluviometer data were also aggregated to daily totals, for the-same purpose. The extremes obtained using disaggregation methods were compared to the observed extremes in a cross validation procedure. The unusual and novel goal was not to obtain the reproduction of the precipitation matching in space and time, but to obtain frequency distributions of the point extremes, which we found to be stable.

AB Flood control in the Yangtze River Basin has always been a thorny issue in Chinese history. Along with the development of water science and technology, a large number of reservoirs have been constructed in the Yangtze River Basin, especially the progress of the reservoir operation theory, the joint flood control simulation and decision-making of reservoir groups has been applied extensively, which proved an effective way to reduce the flood risks and losses in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. However, an increase in the constraints of the reservoir operation (or a single reservoir becoming a multiple-reservoir system) results in an exponential increase in the computational dimensions of the joint flood control simulation, often referred to as the 'curse of dimensionality'. Therefore, based on the aggregation-decomposition (AGDP) method, this paper proposes a cascaded reservoir group integrated operation mode, namely, the 'reverse order impoundment method of cascade reservoir' (ROIMCR) mode, and adopts the improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm to solve the optimization problem of the ROIMCR mode (IABC-ROIMCR) and establish an optimal operation model for cascade reservoir joint flood control. The results show that: 1. With the 'conventional operation' (CO) mode, the ROIMCR mode has more advantages, the average peak flow reduction rate with 32.89% is higher than that of the CO mode 2.91%. 2. In solving the flood optimization operation problem of the cascade reservoir system, the application of the IABC algorithm can effectively reduce the dimensions in the mathematical mode, and has evident effects. The average peak flow reduction rate in the IABC-ROIMCR mode is 44.87%, and 14.89% higher than those of the CO mode. 3. With the IABC-ROIMCR mode, the flood crest standard of cascade reservoirs can be reduced from a 100-year return period to less than a 5-year period, and the flood crest standard of the Lizhuang Hydrological Station from more than a 50-year return period to less than 5-year period. The flood crest standard of the Zhutuo Hydrological Station can be reduced from a 100-year return period to approximately a 5-year period, thereby greatly improving the flood control standard in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. In addition, the peak inflow to the Three Gorges Reservoir is reduced, and as a result, the flood control pressure in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin is alleviated to a certain extent.

TI Effects of river flow scaling properties on riparian width and
   vegetation biomass
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DISTRIBUTIONS; ECOSYSTEMS; RAINFALL; ZONES
AB [1] The theory of stochastic differential equations driven by multiplicative Markovian dichotomous noise and a number of geomorphological relationships of river basins are used to investigate the geomorphological patterns of the width of riparian zones and the associated riparian vegetation biomass. Under the assumption that the scaling relationship between the river flow fluctuations, represented by the standard deviation of the flows, sigma(Q), and drainage area holds, i.e., sigma(Q) similar to A(s), we find that the scaling exponent s plays an important role in determining the patterns of the riparian width and vegetation biomass. In particular, high values of s, i.e., when the fluctuation grows relatively fast with drainage area, could result in the riparian zones of high-magnitude streams being completely void of vegetation, whereas low values of s result in the riparian zones increasing in width with the stream magnitude. For very low s such an increasing trend of riparian width scales with the stream magnitude with an exponent approaching the negative value of the scaling exponent of the stream bank slope. The analysis presented here offers a potentially useful tool that can be used in watershed management, especially under changing climatic conditions, which may induce larger flow fluctuations and extreme events.

AB The use of digital elevation models (DEMs) allows the automatic derivation of channel networks and the quantitative description of the geomorphic characteristics of basins. A common method of channel network extraction from DEM data is based on the specification of a threshold area (A(t)) that is the minimum support area required to drain to a point for a channel to form. Usually, an arbitrary constant threshold area value is chosen for channel network extraction. In this study the effects of threshold area selection, both on the morphometric and scaling properties (such as drainage density, total channel length, Horton laws and fractal dimension) of a channel network and the associated hydrological response function are analysed. The response is obtained following the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph theory. Two different probabilistic models are used. They both relate the characteristic response function of the basin to its DEM data derived networks: one is derived assuming a Strahler stream ordering system and the other is obtained by averaging a flow equation with respect to the network structure (described by the width function). Applications are shown for three mountainous basins in the Italian Alps. A sensitivity analysis is performed to study the influence of the variability of morphometric properties, with respect to A(t), on the hydrological response obtained. It is shown that the model based on the width function is able to reduce the effects of this variability on the simulated response. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Global distributions of glacier properties: A stochastic scaling
   paradigm
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Many problems in global climate and Earth systems science require knowledge of regional- or global-scale distributions of glacier properties, which includes mass balance, ice velocity, flux, thickness, volume, and surface area, among others. With roughly 160,000 glaciers worldwide, obtaining information on the global probability distributions of most ice properties is expensive and often infeasible. Only surface area distributions are relatively easy to measure, either by direct observation or remote sensing. While other properties are difficult to observe, this work shows that scaling relationships from the continuum dynamics of ice can link the distribution of surface areas to the global and regional distributions of any other continuum property. Some data inventories already exist for constructing reasonable distributions of glacier sizes, and this analysis presents theoretical arguments based on glacier network topologies (similar in concept to river networks) to suggest a power law times an exponential distribution of surface areas (in agreement with the data). Therefore, by using existing data or the theoretical distributions of surface areas, specific distributions for other glacier properties in any region of the world can be constructed. As an example, predictions (up to a scaling constant) are made for the distribution of glacier volumes, characteristic thicknesses, characteristic velocities, and characteristic response times in the Alps.

TI ANALYSIS OF LAND-SURFACE HEAT FLUXES USING THE ORTHONORMAL WAVELET

AB Heat fluxes under unstable atmospheric conditions are measured and analyzed using orthonormal wavelet expansions. Both wavelet and Fourier power spectra display a -1 power law that can be derived from dimensional arguments for latent and sensible heat flux in the turbulent production subrange. The wavelet expansion is used to investigate the spatial structure of the heat fluxes for those scales that exhibit a -1 power law. Dimensionless statistical measures which provide spatial information at different scales are developed and applied to the sensible and latent heat flux measurements. Deviations from Gaussian statistics were observed at the turbulent production subrange. The large flux events (both positive and negative) in the heat flux signals contribute directly to the energy and spatial structure of the -1 power law. The wavelet transform is used to identify the scale of turbulent action directly responsible for the tails observed in the horizontal gradient probability density function of both heat fluxes.

AB Considerable attention has been paid to the extreme floods affecting Taihu Lake and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River (China) since they have caused serious socio-economic problems past and present. To fully understand these low probability events, it is necessary to build longtime-series of flood occurrence using flood-level proxies from archaeology and sedimentology that extends the period of observation beyond that of instrumental data. Using historical stele flood markers relicts and lacustrine sediment records from Taihu Lake, this paper attempts to reconstruct the historical flood events, to compare the stele-measured flood levels with those recorded by the modern gauges, and to identify the extreme flood signals among the flood events over the past 400 years. Results indicate that the lowest lake level of the 15 extreme floods by stele-records in the period 1600-1954 AD was 4.07 m a.s.l., equivalent to the 80th percentile of hydrological-gauged lake levels during 1921-2004 AD; this comparison provides a quantitative analogue for the floods reconstructed from lake sediments. Flood signals from coarse silt-sand sediments and low-frequency magnetic susceptibility profiles captured 85% of flood years in the historical period, and five extreme flood years that were missed in the stele flood records were found. There were three flood years that were identified from the historical documents in 1766, 1875 and 1882 AD, respectively, when lake-flood levels were estimated at 4.0-4.1 m, 4.1-4.2 m and 4.13-4.23 m, respectively. Spectral analysis was used to identify return periods from the three time series of the stele flood records, grain flood index and magnetic flood index, respectively; these analyses indicated some synchronous patterns and showed common return periods of 90-102 years, 60-62 years and 42-44 years. To test if the historical extreme floods have statistical relationships with climate variability, a two-variables-conditional test following Poisson's distribution was applied: the estimated probabilities of 0.17-0.20 between a proxy of the Pacific Decadal Osculation (PDO) and the flood events were obtained. These estimates indicate that the hypothesis that the two variables have significant correlations can be accepted, suggesting that the Taihu historical extreme floods were significantly linked with the changes in the Pacific monsoon and summer precipitation. This study demonstrate the possibility of reconstructing past extreme floods where gauge data are not available and has relevance to the prediction of future extreme floods which will have possible disastrous socio-economic impacts on the Taihu catchment.

AB Traditionally, the problems in predicting sediment yield at the basin scale are related to model's high data requirements, the focus on a limited amount of erosion and sediment transport processes and a general lack of systems knowledge. Here, we explore the performance of semi-quantitative approaches to predict mean annual area-specific sediment yield (SSY) at the scale of small to medium-sized basins. The Factorial Scoring Model (FSM) [Verstraeten, G., Poesen, J., de Vente, J., Koninckx, X., 2003. Sediment yield variability in Spain: a quantitative and semiqualitative analysis using reservoir sedimentation rates. Geomorphology 50 (4), 327-348], the PSIAC model [PSIAC, 1968. Pacific Southwest Inter-Agency Committee. Report of the water management subcommittee on factors affecting sediment yield in the Pacific southwest area and selection and evaluation of measures for reduction of erosion and sediment yield] and some variations of these models were applied to predict SSY for the 60 reservoirs, using the reservoir sedimentation rates as published by Avendano Salas et al. [Avendano Salas, C., Sanz Montero, E., Gomez Montana, J.L., 1997. Sediment yield at Spanish reservoirs and its relationship with the drainage basin area. Dix-neuvieme Congres des Grands Barrages. Commission Internationale De Grands Barrages, Florence, pp. 863-874]. The FSM explained 72% of the variability found in reservoir sedimentation rates, which is significantly better than estimates based on basin area alone, explaining only 22%. The FSM uses five factors (i.e. topography, lithology, vegetation cover, gullies, basin shape) to characterise a drainage basin in the vicinity (< 5 km) of the reservoir and the main tributaries feeding the reservoir, by providing a score. An index is calculated by multiplying the scores per factor. Together with basin area, this index is used to predict SSY. The PSIAC model works in a comparable way, though some other factors are used (i.e. topography, climate, runoff, lithology, soil, vegetation, land use, upland erosion, channel erosion), basin area is not part of the relation and the index is calculated by summation of all scores. PSIAC explained 58% of the variation in SSY. Advantages of both models over physically based and other empirical models are that less data are required, gully erosion is included and the importance of connectivity in the landscape is recognised. This study thus demonstrates that semi-quantitative approaches can provide fairly accurate and reliable estimates of SSY at the scale of small to medium sized basins, with relatively low data requirements.

AB [ 1] Accurate estimates of solute export are critical for mass balance studies of elemental flux. We explored how variation in hydrology ( e. g., flashiness) and concentration-discharge relationships modulate the effect of solute sampling frequency on bias and precision associated with estimates of dissolved silica export in rivers. Dissolved silica concentration and discharge data from 14 rivers were used to parameterize a nonlinear concentration-discharge model, which was used to generate simulated data for daily dissolved silica concentration for 20 rivers. We determined how solute sampling at various intervals affects bias, precision, and root-mean-square error of export estimates. Bias and coefficient of variation of dissolved silica export increased with coarser sampling intervals. Flashiness and the coefficient of variation of daily discharge typically explained 90% or more of the variation in bias and precision of dissolved silica export, particularly at finer sampling intervals. Our analysis should be useful to researchers and land managers who are planning or evaluating sampling programs to determine solute flux or who seek error estimates for solute export.

AB Solute mixing in fluids is enhanced significantly by chaotic advection, the phenomenon in which fluid pathlines completely fill the spatial domain explored by a laminar flow. Steady groundwater flows are, in general, not well conditioned for this phenomenon because Darcy's law confines them spatially to nonintersecting stream surfaces. Unsteady groundwater flows, however, may, in principle, induce chaotic solute advection if their time dependence is periodic and produces frequent reorientation of pathlines, an effect connected closely to the development of high solute mixing efficiencies. In this paper, a simple, two- dimensional model groundwater system is studied theoretically to evaluate the possibility of inducing chaotic solute advection in the flow field near a recirculation well whose pumping behavior is time periodic. In the vernacular of dynamical systems theory the model studied is an example of a Hamiltonian system, thus allowing a mathematical formulation that facilitates consideration of whether chaotic advection can occur. When the model system is driven time periodically by alternate operation of the production and injection components of the recirculation well, numerical simulations of the fluid pathlines indicate that regions of chaotic solute advection will, indeed, develop in the flow field near the well, with expected major improvement in plume spreading.

AB Aquatic ecological rehabilitation is attracting increasing public and research attention, but without knowledge of the responses of aquatic species to their habitats the success of habitat restoration is uncertain. Thus efficient study of species response to habitat, through which to prioritize the habitat factors influencing aquatic ecosystems, is highly important. However many current models have too high requirement for assemblage information and have great bias in results due to consideration of only the species' attribute of presence/absence, abundance or biomass, thus hindering the wider utility of these models. This paper, using fish as a case, presents a framework for identification of high-priority habitat factors based on the responses of aquatic species to their habitats, using presence/absence, abundance and biomass data. This framework consists of four newly developed sub-models aiming to determine weightings for the evaluation of species' contributions to their communities, to quantitatively calculate an integrated habitat suitability index for multi-species based on habitat factors, to assess the suitable probability of habitat factors and to assess the rehabilitation priority of habitat factors. The framework closely links hydrologic, physical and chemical habitat factors to fish assemblage attributes drawn from monitoring datasets on hydrology, water quality and fish assemblages at a total of 144 sites, where 5084 fish were sampled and tested. Breakpoint identification techniques based on curvature in cumulated dominance along with a newly developed weighting calculation model based on theory of mass systems were used to help identify the dominant fish, based on which the presence and abundance of multiple fish were normalized to estimate the integrated habitat suitability index along gradients of various factors, based on their variation with principal habitat factors. Then, the appropriate probability of every principal habitat factor was estimated and graded, and the priority of habitat factors for rehabilitation was determined. Application of the model to Jinan City, a pilot city for the construction of a civilized and ecological city in China, proved effective, revealing that carbonate is the poorest habitat factor and has the highest priority for ecological rehabilitation. This was tested using two methods: alternative priority models and a dataset of all habitat factors in place of only the principal habitat factors. We also found that hydrological factors have higher priority than the water quality factors at the levels of both the whole city and its subordinate eco-regions and therefore that hydrological factors deserve special attention in the future ecosystem rehabilitation. Further, the current habitat state makes nearly half of the habitats in Jinan City undesirable for fish communities, largely due to long-term agricultural practices. Spatially, rivers in the mountainous region south of Jinan city and adjacent to the urban area and rivers in the agricultural region north of the city should be emphasized in future habitat rehabilitation. All of these findings have substantial ramifications for the rehabilitation of aquatic ecosystems in Jinan City as a reference for river ecological remediation in rivers with scarce ecological data worldwide.

AB Images from satellite platforms are a valid aid in order to obtain distributed information about hydrological surface states and parameters needed in calibration and validation of the water balance and flood forecasting. Remotely sensed data are easily available on large areas and with a frequency compatible with land cover changes. In this paper, remotely sensed images from different types of sensor have been utilized as a support to the calibration of the distributed hydrological model MOBIDIC, currently used in the experimental system of flood forecasting of the Arno River Basin Authority. Six radar images from ERS-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors (three for summer 2002 and three for spring-summer 2003) have been utilized and a relationship between soil saturation indexes and backscatter coefficient from SAR images has been investigated. Analysis has been performed only on pixels with meagre or no vegetation cover, in order to legitimize the assumption that water content of the soil is the main variable that influences the backscatter coefficient. Such pixels have been obtained by considering vegetation indexes (NDVI) and land cover maps produced by optical sensors (Landsat-ETM). In order to calibrate the soil moisture model based on information provided by SAR images, an optimization algorithm has been utilized to minimize the regression error between saturation indexes from model and SAR data and error between measured and modelled discharge flows. Utilizing this procedure, model parameters that rule soil moisture fluxes have been calibrated, obtaining not only a good match with remotely sensed data, but also an enhancement of model performance in flow prediction with respect to a previous calibration with river discharge data only.

AB This paper presents a new approach to improving real-time reservoir operation. The approach combines two major procedures: the genetic algorithm (GA) and the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The GA is used to search the optimal reservoir operating histogram based on a given inflow series, which can be recognized as the base of input-output training patterns in the next step. The ANFIS is then built to create the fuzzy inference system, to construct the suitable structure and parameters, and to estimate the optimal water release according to the reservoir depth and inflow situation. The practicability and effectiveness of the approach proposed is tested on the operation of the Shihmen reservoir in Taiwan. The current M-5 operating rule curves of the Shihmen reservoir are also evaluated. The simulation results demonstrate that this new approach, in comparison with the M-5 rule curves, has superior performance with regard to the prediction of total water deficit and generalized shortage index (GSI).

AB A typical deficiency of ensemble forecasts is the lack of calibration; e.g., ensemble members are under-dispersed and, consequently, probabilities estimated from them cannot be taken at their face values. Self-calibration is one of the unique theoretic properties of the Bayesian forecasting system, BFS. Its ensemble version, EBFS, inherits this property, provided the ensemble size is large enough. That requirement motivated the version with randomization, EBFSR, presented in part I. Its unique advantage is the operational feasibility of generating a hydrologic ensemble forecast of large size, M (having hundreds or even thousands of members), from a meteorologic input ensemble forecast of small size, M-I (having only tens or hundreds of members): M-I < M, with M = M-I/R, where R stands for randomization factor (R > 1 and integer). This R-fold enlargement of the ensemble size is achieved through a Monte Carlo generator (sans extra runs of the hydrologic model) and, therefore, requires little extra effort or computing time. But what are the statistical implications?
   The objective of this part II is to identify experimentally the sampling properties of the EBFSR so that its advantage can be properly harnessed in operational forecasting. The core matter to understand and to quantify is the tradeoff between the computing efficiency and the statistical efficiency of the EBFSR. This is so because the user must specify (i) the largest acceptable sampling error [measured in terms of the average expected maximum absolute difference, (E) over bar (MAD), between the true but unknown predictive distribution function of the forecasted variate and the empirical distribution function estimated from a sample of size m, a fraction of the ensemble size M], and (ii) the tradeoff between M-I and R. Critical to deciding this tradeoff are two relationships: (E) over bar (MAD) = xi(m) and M-E = tau(M-P, R), where M-P is the size of the input sub-ensemble with positive precipitation amounts, and M-E is the effective sample size of the output sub-ensemble of size MPR. In terms of output/input ensemble sizes, the computing efficiency is M/M-I = R > 1, and the statistical efficiency is M-E/MPR < 1 because M-P < M-E < MPR.
   Based on results of large numerical experiments, general parametric forms of xi and tau are identified, and the dependence of the parameter values is established on factors such as the forecast type (probabilistic river stage forecast, probabilistic stage transition forecast, probabilistic flood forecast), the forecast lead time, the magnitude of the precipitation input uncertainty, and the informativeness of the deterministic hydrologic model employed by the EBFSR. Finally, two algorithms are formulated to aid the user in specifying the values of M and R, such that <(E)over bar>(MAD) does not exceed the largest acceptable value and that operational constraints are satisfied (e.g., constraints regarding the input ensemble size M-I or the feasible number of runs of the hydrologic model).

AB Sediment transfer in mountain streams occurs via processes classified as debris flows, hyperconcentrated flows, debris floods, and water flows under the control of the water energy and the amount of involved sediment. Despite the extensive documentation of the channel changes caused by high-magnitude hydrological events, the analysis of the sediment-water flows occurring during such floods is currently a minimally explored issue. This study investigated how the transport mechanisms activated in a mountain stream during a high-magnitude flood differ from those triggered during ordinary floods. It also evaluated the effectiveness of three morphometric approaches in predicting high-magnitude flows expectable in a channel sub-reach. The study area is the Tegnas catchment (Dolomites, Italy), a mountain basin affected in 2018 by a severe hydrological event (Vaia Storm), whose recurrence interval is approximately 200 years. We determined the transport processes typifying the stream network in the catchment during ordinary floods through field surveys and direct monitoring and compared these flows with the high-magnitude flow types that occurred during the Vaia Storm. Additionally, we examined the flows predicted using the morphometric approaches for high-magnitude events. We observed water flow as a response to ordinary events occurring along the entire Tegnas main stem, whereas debris flow ordinarily determines sediment transfer at steep tributaries. During the Vaia Storm, water flow still dominated along the Tegnas Torrent, although debris flows and debris floods were also documented at several sub-reaches of the main stem. The morphometric approaches satisfactorily predicted debris flows but often failed to recognize the debris floods occurred during the high-magnitude 2018 flooding. The analysis of different flow types enabled us to infer relationships among transport mechanisms, hydraulic forcing, and channel dynamics and to gain new insights on the poorly explored debris flood processes. Water flows transitioned into debris floods under unit stream powers exceeding the threshold of 5000 to 5500 W m(-2) or downstream of sediment-injection points. The occurrence of debris floods, which caused higher channel widening than that induced by water flows, appeared to be facilitated by the presence of tributaries prone to debris flow occurrence connected to a receiving stream, the injection of fine material into the flows, and channels characterized by high slope and narrow section. The morphometric approaches enabled adequate first-order discrimination of expectable high-magnitude flows, but a more detailed characterization that includes field observations is necessary to understand the transport mechanisms that can affect a specific channel site during high-magnitude hydrological events for a more accurate and reliable definition of flood hazard at the local scale.

AB The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is a new tool for continuously monitoring mean soil-water content (SWC) on a hectometer scale, but the performance of CRNPs in highly heterogeneous distributions of SWC, vegetation and especially soil texture caused by the broken surface on the Loess Plateau in China remains uncertain. The study evaluated the application and accuracy of the method for three soil textures in a small watershed on the plateau to provide a reference and scientific basis for its application. Three CRNPs were installed in a loamy sand hills (LSH) plot, a silty loam dam (SLD) plot, and a sandy loam slope (SLS) plot, soil moisture sensors were buried at various depths in three plots. The footprints of the CRNPs for SWC observation had radii of 127-170, 126-174 and 148-174 m in SLD, SLS and LSH, respectively, and the mean measuring depth was about 20 cm for SLD and SLS and 40 cm for LSH based on general calculation equations. The accuracy of the CRNP method was high when validated using oven-dried method (RMSE = 0.068 cm(3) cm(-3)). The mean SWCs estimated from the other types of sensors were consistent with the mean SWCs from the CRNP probes in the three plots. The coefficient of determination of the linear relationship was in the order: SLS > LSH > SLD. The coefficient of variations (CV) were higher in LSH than SLD and SLS, indicating that SWC varied most in LSH. During periods of rain, the variations were larger for SLD than SLS and LSH, with a CV of 32.2%. The CRNP for SLD had the highest rates of change during periods with and without rain for both increasing and decreasing SWC, but this plot held more water than LSH and SLS, consistent with the high clay and organic-matter contents in SLD. The rates of change were significantly correlated with the antecedent SWCs (P < 0.01), and the higher the antecedent SWC, the faster the rate of change for each plot. This study verified the application of the CRNP for monitoring field-average SWC of the broken surface on the Loess Plateau and represents a new approach for the study of the spatial distribution of SWC on the plateau. CRNP can measure SWC of the complex underlying surface accurately, so as to provide a more reliable assessment of the impacts of landscapes and vegetation changes, such as conversion of cropland to forest and grassland on the Loess Plateau on water resources.

AB Hydrological controls on DOC and N transport at the catchment scale were studied for five storm events from the fall of 2004 through the spring of 2005 in WS10, H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. This catchment is devoid of any riparian zone and characterized by hillslopes that issue directly into the stream. This enabled us to compare a trenched hillslope response to the stream response without the influence of riparian zone mixing. DOC and N concentrations and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality (specific UV-absorbance (SUVA) and C:N of DOM) were investigated at the plot scale, in lateral subsurface flow from the trenched hillslope and stream water at the catchment outlet at the annual and seasonal scale (transition vs. wet period) during baseflow and stormflow conditions. DON was the dominant form of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in all sampled solutions, except in transient groundwater, where DIN was the dominant form. Organic horizon leachate and transient groundwater were characterized by high SUVA, and high DOC and total N concentrations, while SUVA and DOC and DON concentrations in lysimeters decreased with depth in the soil profile. This suggests vertical preferential flow without much soil matrix interaction occurred at the site. Deep groundwater (from a spring at the base of the hillslope) was characterized by low SUVA and low DOC and N concentrations. SUVA was always lower in lateral subsurface flow than in stream water at the seasonal scale, even during the wet period when other solutes were similar between lateral subsurface flow and stream water. This suggested mixing of deep groundwater and shallow transient groundwater was different at the hillslope scale compared to the catchment scale. DOC and DON sources were finite (production of DOC and DON from the hillslope soils appeared to be limited) at the seasonal scale since DOC and DON concentrations were significantly lower during the wet period compared to the transition period during stormflow conditions. This was also reflected in the DOC and DON peak and flow weighted storm event concentrations and antecedent soil moisture relationship where drier conditions (less prior flushing) resulted in the highest DOC and DON peak and flow weighted storm event concentrations. Results from this study showed the importance of the hillslope component in DOC and N transport at the catchment scale and underscore the importance of sampling solutes below the root zone (transient groundwater) and the value of using SUVA to fingerprint DOC sources.

AB We present a novel approach for optimizing reservoir operation through fuzzy programming and a hybrid evolution algorithm, i.e. genetic algorithm (GA) with simulated annealing (SA). In the analysis, objectives and constraints of reservoir operation are transformed by fuzzy progamming for searching the optimal degree of satisfaction. In the hybrid search procedure, the GA provides a global search and the SA algorithm provides local search. This approach was investigated to search the optimizing operation scheme of Shihmen Reservoir in Taiwan. Monthly inflow data for three years reflecting different hydrological conditions and a consecutive 10-year period were used. Comparisons were made with the existing M-5 reservoir operation rules. The results demonstrate that: (1) fuzzy programming could effectively formulate the reservoir operation scheme into degree of satisfaction a among the users and constraints; (2) the hybrid GA-SA performed much better than the current M-5 operating rules. Analysis also found the hybrid GA-SA conducts parallel analyses that increase the probability of finding an optimal solution while reducing computation time for reservoir operation.

AB Four indicator bacteria were measured in association with physico-chemical constituents and selected inorganics during rainfall, baseflow and snowmelt periods in storm sewers of four urban catchments in a northern Swedish city. The variation patterns of coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens concentrations were assessed in manually collected grab samples together with those of phosphorus, nitrogen, solids, and readings of pH, turbidity, water conductivity, temperature and flow rates to examine whether these constituents could serve as potential indicators of bacteria sources. A similar analysis was applied to variation patterns of eight selected inorganics typical for base flow and stormwater runoff to test the feasibility of using these inorganics to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources of inflow into storm sewers. The monitored catchments varied in size, the degree of development, and land use. Catchment and season (i.e., rainy or snowmelt periods) specific variations were investigated for sets of individual stormwater samples by the principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the constituents with variation patterns similar to those of indicator bacteria, and to exclude the constituents with less similarity. In the reduced data set, the similarities were quantified by the clustering correlation analysis. Finally, the positive/negative relationships found between indicator bacteria and the identified associated constituent groups were described by multilinear regressions. In the order of decreasing concentrations, coliforms, E. coil and enterococci were found in the highest mean concentrations during both rainfall and snowmelt generated runoff. Compared to dry weather baseflow, concentrations of these three indicators in stormwater were 10 (snowmelt runoff) to 102 (rain runoff) times higher. C. perfringens mean concentrations were practically constant regardless of the season and catchment. The type and number of variables associated with bacteria depended on the degree of catchment development and the inherent complexity of bacteria sources. The list of variables associated with bacteria included the flow rate, solids with associated inorganics (Fe and Al) and phosphorus, indicating similar sources of constituents regardless of the season. On the other hand, bacteria were associated with water temperature only during rain periods, and somewhat important associations of bacteria with nitrogen and pH were found during the periods of snowmelt. Most of the associated constituents were positively correlated with bacteria responses, but conductivity, with two associated inorganics (Si and Sr), was mostly negatively correlated in all the catchments. Although the study findings do not indicate any distinct surrogates to indicator bacteria, the inclusion of the above identified constituents (flow rate, solids and total phosphorus for all seasons, water temperature for rainfall runoff, and total nitrogen and pH for snowmelt only) in sanitary surveys of northern climate urban catchments would provide additional insight into indicator bacteria sources and their modeling.

AB This paper is devoted to illustrating new wavelet analysis methods in the field of hydrology. New wavelet indicators are applied to long-term hydrological and climatologic proxies. They are first applied to four Atlantic large river monthly discharges (Amazon, Parana, Orinoco and Congo) and then applied to two well-known long-term climatologic indexes: the Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation. This approach makes it possible to suggest physical explanations for time-scale dependant relationships.
   Six-month variability is present in all the rivers except in the Parana. In the Congo River this signal is near stationary with strong entropy. The strength of this scale coincides with higher discharge variability before 1920 and over the Orinoco basin with higher discharge values between 1940 and 1955. An annual cycle is present in all the rivers but is much stronger, along with the entropy, in the rivers with a large tropical basin, as in the Amazon and the Orinoco. This annual signal is not permanent in the Congo and much more intermittent in the Parana where the annual recharge appears as very irregular. A quasi biennial variability is apparent in all the equator ward rivers and a nearly permanent 2-year coherence is found between Sol and the Amazon discharge. A 3-6year oscillation typical of ENSO variability is observed in all the rivers. It is intermittent, observed before 1930 in all the rivers and after 1980 mostly in the Amazon River. These peaks of activity correspond to periods of major Sol variability.
   An 8-year variability is particularly strong in the Parana River before 1940 and around 1970 and to a lesser extent in the Orinoco River during the low NAO index period, between 1940 and 1970. The Congo River exhibits that time-scale around 1970. A 13-year variability common to Sol, NAO and the South Atlantic Ocean circulation is observed in the Parana and Congo discharges.
   In all the rivers the greatest entropy is observed at bi and multi decadal time scales with the greatest coherence with both NAO and Sol. A near 20-year time-scale is observed in most of the series around 1970, although it is strongest in Amazon and Parana discharges. Finally, a 30-year time-scale is observed between 1940 and 1970.
   It is to be noted that most of the time-scale dominant activities, in all the rivers, may have been influenced by the interdecadal shifts that took place around 1940 and 1970 in the Pacific and in the Atlantic.

AB Remote rural areas, which are generally the source regions for drinking water in small towns in China, experience nitrate pollution due to intensive agricultural activities. However, little is known about the nitrate sources of these waterbodies and how human activities affect the water quality in these rural areas. Here, a pair of rural watersheds on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) were selected for study. One of the watersheds, which provides drinking water for local villages and a nearby small town, has experienced valley reshaping, damming and agricultural land consolidation, whereas the other one was not affected by human activities. Water chemistry monitoring and environmental isotope analysis were combined to identify the nitrate sources of the surface and groundwater in the dammed and natural watersheds and to assess the effects of landform transformation and agricultural and living activities on water quality. The results demonstrated that nitrate concentrations in both watersheds were lower than 10 mg L-1. However, the seasonal nitrate contents in the surface (0.42-0.52 mg L-1) and groundwater (1.86-3.65 mg L-1) of the dammed watershed were significantly lower than those of the natural watershed (surface water: 0.92-2.07 mg L-1; groundwater: 2.73-8.21 mg L-1). Isotope analysis demonstrated that nitrate fertilizer, soil ammonium, and manure and septic waste were the main sources of nitrate in the surface water of the two watersheds, while the nitrate in the groundwater mainly originated from the nitrification of soil ammonium and manure and septic waste. Compared to the natural watershed, the dammed watershed had increased inputs of agricultural fertilizers in the surface water. However, there was no significant difference in the groundwater nitrate sources between the two watersheds. The results also demonstrated that denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) probably occurred in the groundwater during the wet season, while nitrification likely occurred during the dry and snowmelt seasons. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed that there were strong interactions between the surface runoff and the reservoir water in the dammed watershed, while in the natural watershed, streamflow had a close relationship with the groundwater. We concluded that valley reshaping, damming and agricultural land consolidation increased the nitrate input from mineral fertilizers in the watershed, but decreased the nitrate concentrations in the surface water through changing the transformation and transportation processes of nitrate. However, these activities had little influence on the groundwater, while the time lag between land consolidation and the groundwater quality response should be considered in the future. This study aids in developing strategies for the comprehensive management of watershed and drinking water sources in rural regions.

AB The estimates of actual evapotranspiration (E) across basins and/or regions are still facing some difficulties because of the complex interactions amongst the components of the land-plant-atmosphere system, even though the basic physical mechanism of E is well understood. Presenting as a nonlinear relationship constrained by physical limits, the Budyko framework serves as a powerful tool used to estimate the averaged E at long-term scale. Given the ability of Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) in effectively simulating the terrestrial water storage change (Delta TWS) at monthly scale, a model to estimate E was developed based on the Budyko framework with mean monthly parameter of multi-years, and was applied to the estimation of E for the 24 selected catchments in different climatic regions across China. Results indicate that for the majority of 24 catchments, the positive or negative trends in precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (E-0), runoff (R) and Delta TWS were not statistically significant during 2003-2013 at both annual and monthly scales, but the Delta TWS occupied a large proportion in the partitioning of P into R and E at monthly scale. The monthly Budyko parameter showed large variation within the year and also across these 24 catchments. The Budyko-modeled monthly E (Budyko-E) represented the GRACE-derived ones (GRACE-E) across these catchments well with both modeled E volumes and hydrograph shapes which were also consistent with GRACE-E series except some underestimation for peak E. Overall, the Budyko-E represented GRACE-E in the arid and semi-arid catchments comparatively better than it in the humid and semi-humid catchments due to the larger proportion of Delta TWS in the P partition. Among all the 24 selected catchments, the monthly Budyko-type E model represented the GRACE-E across Shixiali catchment (located in the Hai River basin) best, with the correlation coefficient (r), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSCE) and relative error (RE) between GRACE-E and simulated results being 0.996, 0.988, - 0.033 in calibration and 0.994, 0.951, - 0.111 in validation, respectively. Furthermore, using GRACE-E as the benchmark values, the Budyko-E outperformed four other global E products from the newly published Global Land Data Assimilation System with Noah Land Surface Model-2 (GLDAS_E), MODIS (MODIS_E), Japanese 25-year reanalysis product (JRA_E), and Zhang's method (Zhang_E). GLDAS_E was the best of four global E products at reproducing monthly variations, with relatively high r and NSCE values, small RE. While MODIS_E showed the poorest performance in reproducing the inter-annual E variations of these catchments, which was reflected by low r and NSCE values. This extended Budyko-E model can apply in other similar climatic regions and also may provide skill in evaluating the water resources since the preferable accuracy of E estimate.

AB Forest harvest, climate change, and their interaction can alter catchment peak discharges, which have ramifications for channel geomorphology and water quality. Catchments in the boreal-temperate transition zone may be especially vulnerable to these factors. We developed a new approach to peak flow analysis using two long-term, paired catchment experiments in that landscape at the Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in north-central Minnesota. We investigated how forest cover change affects the magnitude, occurrence probability, event decoupling, and seasonal decoupling of annual maximum peak flows. Event decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in response to different events within a given year. Seasonal decoupling is when the annual maximum flows on control and treatment catchments occur in different seasons within a given year. Commonly used statistical methods (e.g., ANCOVA) support inferences only for effects on peak flow magnitude, disregarding effects on event occurrence probability. Statistical stationarity (i.e., time-invariant parameters) is generally assumed within the ANCOVA analysis, despite temporal changes in climatic and land cover controls. Further, use of these methods requires event coupling, which is not always valid for annual maximum flows in catchments with mixed precipitation regimes. To address these limitations, we developed new nonstationary flood-frequency analysis methods with Bayesian parameter estimation to analyze two harvesting experiments, including conversion from deciduous to coniferous species. We compared results from these models to traditional least-squares based methods (e.g., ANCOVA). We assessed event and seasonal decoupling using logistic regression with Bayesian parameter estimation. There was no effect of harvesting on the annual maximum flow according to ANCOVA and generalized least squares models, but these methods were not reliable due to the presence of outliers, and both event and seasonal decoupling. Flood-frequency results from one clearcutting experiment showed increases in the annual maximum flow across nearly all return intervals, with 80-85% confidence for peak discharges between the 10 and 50-year peak flow. The 50-year return interval peak increased from an expected 17 cfs to 34 cfs after harvest. Harvesting induced substantial event decoupling in the catchment pairs, and seasonal decoupling in one catchment pair. As forest cover regenerated, decoupling probability decreased. Our coupling analysis results indicated that control and treatment catchments generated and processed flood peaks differently after harvest, and explained the poor fit of the linear models for which we assumed event coupling. Our study calls into question several key assumptions of traditional linear models in the analysis of paired-catchments given certain conditions. For example, where forest harvesting can affect the season of annual maximum peaks, and thus the phase of the generating precipitation event (snowmelt versus rainfall), it changes the relationship between the catchment pair in a way not accounted for in traditional linear models. We advocate the use of probabilistic methods that can incorporate nonstationarity and are robust to different mechanisms of catchment hydrologic change in response to forest harvest.

AB The biotic composition, structure, and function of aquatic, wetland, and riparian ecosystem depend largely on the hydrological regime (Poff, N.L., Ward, J.V., 1990. Implications of streamflow variability and predictability for lotic community structure: a regional analysis of streamflow patterns. Can. J. Fisheries Aquat. Sci. 46, 1805-1818; Richter, B.D., Baumgartner, J.V., Wiginton, R., Braun, D.P., 1997 How much water does a river need? Freshwater Biol. 37, 231249). Available flow data for many rivers in the world can be used to validate these ecological theories. There is a demand for studies that use hydrological indices to establish criteria, which serve to group together regime types at a local level. Once this has been done, these hydrologically similar groups can be used to identify communities of living organisms that are linked to specific aspects of the river's behaviour.
   An approach to characterise flow regimes in the river network of the Tagus basin in Spain is presented. The river Tagus (rio Tajo) is one of the seven major rivers of the Iberian peninsula. All hydrological data were acquired from the measurements made in the Tagus basin, at 25 gauging stations. Twelve variables were derived for each gauged site to describe variability and predictability of average streamflow conditions, and to describe the frequency, timing and intensity of high flow and low flow extremes.
   A hierarchical clustering routine was used to identify similar groups of rivers as defined in terms of similar characteristics of their streamflow regime. The variables were also examined with simple correlations to determine if multicollinearity occurred, in order to reject redundant parameters or to identify similar behaviour trends between pairs of parameters. Some parameters have shown a tendency to increase or decrease along the east-west axis, suggesting that some of the studied characteristics may have a geographical cause.
   Cluster analysis, with the values of the 12 parameters, reveals two main groups, each of which splits into two main subdivisions. One of these subgroups contains six rivers with similar characteristics, can be considered to be 'classic regular rivers', the stations in this first subgroup are mostly situated geographically close to each other. At the other end, we have found a subgroup, with a high variation of flows over the year and high flood flows; these rivers are highly irregular rivers with great changes. This regular-irregular gradient found between the groups is similar to that observed by others authors (Poff, N.L., Allan J.D., 1995. Functional organization of stream fish assemblages in relation to hydrological variability. Ecology 76, 606-627), and strong associations have been documented with compositions of populations and probably reflect differences in other similar important environmental factors.

AB Parsimonious stage-fall-discharge rating curve models for gauging stations subject to backwater complications are developed from simple hydraulic theory. The rating curve models are compounded in order to allow for possible shifts in the hydraulics when variable backwater becomes effective. The models provide a prior scientific understanding through the relationship between the rating curve parameters and the hydraulic properties of the channel section under Study. This characteristic enables prior distributions for the rating curve parameters to be easily elicited according to site-specific information and the magnitude of well-known hydraulic quantities. Posterior results from three Norwegian and one American twin-gauge stations affected by variable backwater are obtained using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The case studies demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian rating, curve assessment is appropriate for developing rating procedures for gauging stations that are subject to variable backwater.

AB Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) has been widely accepted as a reliable technology for the measurement of volumetric water content (theta) in soils. Here, we present a new procedure for the graphical interpretation of TDR waveforms to determine the variation of the apparent dielectric constant (K) along a single TDR probe in non-conducting media and its application for profiling the moisture content in soils. The method is based on the influence of K on the reflection coefficient (p) and travel time (t) of the TDR signal along a transmission line. A p(t) function is initially defined for a length I of 10 cm and plotted together with the TDR waveform for a three-rod probe of length L (L = nl). The interception point of both lines defines t(11) as the reference time to build a second p(t) line that intercepts the waveform at time t,,. By repeating this process iteratively, a series of p(t) lines intercepting the TDR trace at times t(3l,) t(4l).... and t(nl) is obtained, making it possible to calculate K for apparent probe lengths equal to l,2l,3l... and nl. To test the consistency of the method, two sand column experiments were conducted with two different TDR probe geometries. A total of 144 values of K were measured during a wetting and draining cycle of the sand column with vertical 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-cm long three-wire uncoated TDR probes (diameter d: 2.8 mm; spacing of the outer conductors s: 32 mm) and 10-, 20-, 40-, and 60-cm long coated TDR probes (d: 10 min; s: 80 mm) using the standard double reflection waveform analysis. A satisfactory relationship (R-2 = 0.99) was found between these K values and those obtained for the same depths by the proposed method applied to the 40- and 60-cm long probes, respectively. In this case, a probe-specific correction factor was used for the different probe geometries. Likewise, an excellent match was found between the 0 profiles measured in the sand column applying the new approach to the 60-cm long probe and the 0 profiles measured with horizontal probes placed at 10, 20, 30 and 50 cm depth. The results show that the proposed method is sound and suitable for determining the variation of K at fixed intervals along a single probe and therefore for soil water content profiling.

TI Is the deuterium excess in precipitation a reliable tracer of moisture

   insights from Apuan Alps (Italy)

AB The deuterium excess is a function of the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in water. Traditionally, the d-excess is used worldwide to constrain the moisture sources of precipitation, as it mainly depends on the relative humidity and surface sea temperature at the evaporative sources, that control diffusion of the water molecules across the density gradient. A case in point is represented by precipitation deriving from vapor originating over the eastern Mediterranean Sea, characterized by the higher d-excess values (-22%0) compared to the global average d-excess in precipitation of 10%0. Accordingly, d-excess values of-14%0 found in pre-cipitation across the western Mediterranean are generally interpreted as the result of mixing of Atlantic and Mediterranean air masses. Nevertheless, several studies proved the d-excess values of precipitation evolves during transport of vapor and changes depending on local processes (e.g. sub-cloud evaporation of raindrops, continental moisture recycling, seeder-feeder mechanism), thus compromising the reliability of d-excess as a proxy of vapor source regions. With the aim to investigate the pattern of d-excess in precipitation at higher spatial and temporal resolution, and to evaluate its reliability for tracing the moisture source in the western Mediterranean, in this work we present the results of a study performed in the Apuan Alps (Tuscany, Italy), one of the rainiest areas in Italy. 19 single rain events were collected from 2020 to 2021 at two sites placed at different altitudes. Furthermore, monthly precipitations were collected at five sites at different elevations over different time intervals from 2019 to 2021. Event-based and monthly Local Meteoric Water Lines were computed at each site, indicating droplets evaporation beneath the clouds, especially at lower altitude sites. d-excess seasonally and spatially varied, with higher values registered at higher altitudes in winter and autumn, and lower values at lower altitudes in spring and summer. Large differences in d-excess were found among sites placed at different altitudes, and these differences ranged both at monthly and event scales. Mean and weighted mean d -excess vertical gradients of +0.73%0/100 m (r2 = 0.92) and +0.51%0/100 m (r2 = 0.95), respectively, were computed using 9 months in which monthly samples were collected at all five sites. This positive relationship between altitude and d-excess in precipitation is consistent with a process like sub-cloud evaporation that ap-pears to be the most important process controlling the d-excess spatial variability in the mountainous areas. These findings evidence the importance of local processes acting on the d-excess and downsize the reliability of this parameter in tracing moisture sources in this area. Conversely, the d-excess vertical gradient, combined with the delta 18O vertical gradient (i.e. altitude effect), could be used to identify the recharge areas of groundwater.

AB Belowground urban stormwater networks (BUSNs) are critical for removing excess rainfall from impervious urban areas and preventing or mitigating urban flooding. However, available BUSN data are sparse, preventing the modeling and analysis of urban hydrologic processes at regional and larger scales. We propose a novel algorithm for estimating BUSNs by drawing on concepts from graph theory and existing, extensively available land surface data, such as street network, topography, and land use/land cover. First, we derive the causal relationships between the topology of BUSNs and urban surface features based on graph theory concepts. We then apply the causal relationships and estimate BUSNs using web-service data retrieval, spatial analysis, and high-performance computing techniques. Finally, we validate the derived BUSNs in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, and Baltimore in the US, where real BUSN data are partly available to the public. Results show that our algorithm can effectively capture 59 %-76 % of the topology of real BUSN data, depending on the supporting data quality. This algorithm has promising potential to support large-scale urban hydrologic modeling and future urban drainage system planning.

AB Snowmelt and groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) dynamics are the most dominant controllers of hydrological processes and water availability in northern latitudes, particularly in warm seasons. The dynamics and changes of snowmelt and GW-SW interactions and their interrelationship at the regional scale are poorly understood in regional analyses. To fill this gap, this study implements a process-based hydrological model, using a coupled Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and MODFLOW model, to map snowmelt and GW-SW dynamics at regional scales. The primary research questions are "how are GW-SW interactions altered by snowmelt dynamics?" and "what is the effect of climate change on snowmelt and GW-SW dynamics?" We simulated snowmelt and groundwater dynamics across a large watershed encompassing different ecohydrological regions, including mountains, foothills, and plains, analyzing the spatio-temporal relationships between GW-SW interactions and snowmelts in historical (1983-2007) and future (2040-2064) periods. We used an ensemble of five global climate models (GCMs) for future projections based on two emission scenarios (i.e., RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). We also used the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method to examine the effects of snowmelt, evapotranspiration (ET), and rainfall on GW-SW interactions. These analyses are implemented in mountains, foothills, and plains regions in a large snow-dominated watershed in western Canada. Results show that earlier snowmelt is predicted in mountains and foothills regions under climate change scenarios, while less snow accumulation and melt is anticipated in plains region. Future projections of GW-SW interactions show an increase in groundwater discharge to streams in the winter and spring seasons, mainly due to earlier snowmelt in winter and spring in mountains and foothills regions. On the other hand, more surface water loss to groundwater in summer and fall is predicted, which can be caused by the low level of groundwater under future conditions in foothills regions. Correlation analysis between regional snowmelt and GW-SW interactions for historical simulations show a higher correlation (R-2 = 0.494) in mountains region, compared to very low correlations (R-2 < 0.01) in foothills and plains regions. LASSO results showed that ET was the main control of dynamics of GW-SW interactions in all regions of the study. Snowmelt was the next most important predictor of GW-SW dynamics in the mountains region, while rainfall was more important in the foothills region. Nevertheless, none of the three predictors strongly influenced GW-SW dynamics in the plains region, mainly due to low groundwater levels and a lack of connectivity with the surface water. Overall, it is shown that the ecohydrogeological and climatic variability of different regions plays an important part in governing GW-SW dynamics.

AB A new fuzzy neural network method to predict minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in a highly urbanised riverine environment (in Calgary, Canada) is proposed. The method uses abiotic factors (non-living, physical and chemical attributes) as inputs to the model, since the physical mechanisms governing DO in the river are largely unknown. A new two-step method to construct fuzzy numbers using observations is proposed. Then an existing fuzzy neural network is modified to account for fuzzy number inputs and also uses possibility theory based intervals to train the network. Results demonstrate that the method is particularly well suited to predicting low DO events in the Bow River. Model performance is compared with a fuzzy neural network with crisp inputs, as well as with a traditional neural network. Model output and a defuzzification technique are used to estimate the risk of low DO so that water resource managers can implement strategies to prevent the occurrence of low DO.

AB Studying the spatial and temporal variations of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values (delta D and delta O-18, respectively) in precipitation and groundwater in catchments with different land cover is of great significance to understanding the hydrologic cycles within the catchments. This study is focused on three karst catchments, Banzhai, Chenqi and Dengzhanhe, in Guizhou Province, Southwest China, a region with a subtropical humid monsoon climate. We analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in the SD and delta O-18 of precipitation and groundwater in these areas from September 2007 to September 2009. Local meteoric water lines (LMWLs) for the study areas and their relationships with groundwater were established. The seasonal variations of 8121 and delta O-18 for both precipitation and groundwater were similar, being depleted in the heavier isotopomer in the rainy season and enriched in the heavier isotopomer in the dry season. The similarity of patterns between groundwater and precipitation indicates short groundwater residence times in the three catchments, typical of karst terrains. The isotopic values of the Banzhai catchment, which is covered by a thin soil layer beneath virgin forest floor, had the largest variation among the three catchments. The isotopic compositions of the Banzhai catchment groundwater were close to those of precipitation in the rainy season and responded rapidly to it, indicating that precipitation quickly recharges groundwater in this area. In comparison, in the Chenqi and Dengzhanhe catchments, the thicker soil layers and large numbers of paddy fields and dry lands in the catchments resulted in more intense evaporation, and therefore relatively higher isotopic values in the infiltration water. Consequently, the isotopic values of spring water in these two areas were higher and varied to a lesser extent in the rainy season than those of precipitation. The Rayleigh fractionation model based on the correlation between the deuterium excess (d) and evaporation was employed in this study. The model calculation results showed that the catchment evaporation was more intense in Dengzhanhe than in Chenqi, with 14 +/- 1% and 6 +/- 4% of the water evaporated in Dengzhanhe and Chenqi, respectively. The higher percentage of evaporation in Dengzhanhe was mainly due to the larger percentage of paddy fields in the catchment. In contrast, the effects of evaporation from free water surfaces or soil surfaces on groundwater in the virgin forest-covered Banzhai catchment were extremely weak. Based on the isotopic and high-resolution continuous meteorological and discharge data, the transpiration rates were estimated to be 78% for Banzhai, 10 +/- 4% for Chenqi, and 24 +/- 1% for Dengzhanhe, and the differences among these values are mainly attributed to differences in vegetation types in those areas. These results show that the variation in stable isotopes in groundwater can be used as a key index in evaluating the effects of different land cover changes and environmental changes on the water cycle in a catchment.

Measurements in winter of sensible heat (H) for the small and shallow reservoir of Midmar Darn, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were made using the Surface renewal (SR) method, a renewal model method that uses the average cubic air temperature structure function and eddy covariance (EC). The small magnitude of H during winter makes it difficult to test the reliability of the H estimates obtained using instruments and sensors mounted above the water Surface using the SR, renewal model and EC methods. Latent energy flux was estimated as a residual of the energy balance using additional measurements of net irradiance R-n above the water surface and the water-stored heat flux. The SR sensible heat flux (H-SR) Was estimated for heights of 1.0, 1.3, 1.9 and 2.5 m above the water surface using two air temperature time lags r of 0.4 and 0.8 s of the 10-Hz measurements. The SR method depends on a weighting factor alpha which represents the capability of the atmospheric turbulence to mix the scalar, within the air parcel to be renewed. The factor alpha was determined for each measurement height and time lag from the slope of a linear regression relationship forced through the origin of measured EC sensible heat flux (H-EC) values on the y-axis vs. H-SR or renewal model 14 on the x-axis All alpha values. obtained using the renewal model method were not statistically different from that obtained using the SR method for z = 1.0 in for both time lags. Using a calibration dataset. an average alpha value for the 1.0- and 1.3-m heights of 0.198 for r = 0.4 s and 0.245 for r = 0.8 s for the SR and renewal model methods was obtained. The 30-min H-SR, renewal model and H-EC estimates were often the smallest component of the energy balance (generally -40 to 40 W m(-2)) and compared reasonably well for the validation dataset. The heat storage flux G was larger in magnitude (0-200 W m(-2)) compared to the sensible heat flux. The SR, renewal model and EC latent energy fluxes, each Calculated as residuals of the energy balance, were almost the same in magnitude as the available energy flux R-n - G due to the relatively small magnitude of the sensible heat flux during the winter measurement period. The daily evaporation Fanged between 1.0 and 3.9 mm. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The complementary principle is an important methodology for estimating actual evaporation by using routinely observed meteorological variables. This review summaries its 56-year development, focusing on how related studies have shifted from adopting a symmetric linear complementary relationship (CR) to employing generalized non-linear functions. The original CR denotes that the actual evaporation (E) and "apparent" potential evaporation (E-pa) depart from the potential evaporation (E-p0) complementarily when the land surface dries from a completely wet environment with constant available energy. The CR was then extended to an asymmetric linear relationship, and the linear nature was retained through properly formulating E-pa and/or E-p0. Recently, the linear CR was generalized to a sigmoid function and a polynomial function. The sigmoid function does not involve the formulations of E-pa and E-p0 but uses the Penman (1948) potential evaporation and its radiation component as inputs, whereas the polynomial function inherits E-p0 and Ep a as inputs and requires proper formulations for application. The generalized complementary principle has a more rigorous physical base and offers a great potential in advancing evaporation estimation. Future studies may cover several topics, including the boundary conditions in wet environments, the parameterization and application over different regions of the world, and integration with other approaches for further development.

AB This piece of research deals with the monitoring of a group of emerging contaminants (ECs) in the metropolitan area of Granada, a city representative of the South of Spain, in order to evaluate the environmental management of the wastewater system. With that aim, the spatial and seasonal occurrence and distribution of a group of ECs in groundwater, surface and irrigation water resources from the aquifer "Vega de Granada" (VG) have been investigated for the first time. A set of the most prescribed drugs in Spain (ibuprofen, loratadine, pantoprazole and paracetamol), a pesticide widely used in agriculture (atrazine) and a typical anthropogenic contaminant (caffeine) were included in the study. Water samples were taken from the metropolitan area of the city of Granada inside of the zone of the aquifer, from the downstream of two waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and from the two main irrigation channels where surface and wastewater are mixed before distribution for irrigation purposes in the crops of the study area. A total of 153 water samples were analyzed through liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) throughout the study that took place over a period of two years, from July 2011 to July 2013. Results demonstrated the occurrence of four of the six target pollutants. Ibuprofen was detected several times, always in both channels with concentration ranges from 5.3 to 20.8 mu g/L. The occurrence of paracetamol was detected in rivers and channels up to 34.3 mu g/l.. Caffeine was detected in all the water resources up to 39.3 mu g/L. Pantoprazole was detected twice in the surface water source near to a WWPT ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 mu g/L. The pesticide atrazine and the drug loratadine were not detected in any of the water samples analyzed. These results show evidence of poor environmental management of the wastewater concerning the water quality of the aquifer studied. The groundwater sources seem to receive a very continuous input of wastewater due to leaks from the drainage and sewerage system. This input may increase during rainy periods when it joins the recharge flow. The relationship between ECs and surface waters can be observed by comparing the averages for the rainy period with those for the driest. The highest concentration of ECs in irrigation water sources were detected in irrigation period times, between March and July. In general, concentration of the ECs uncovered in this study are similar to those reported in water sources from developed countries and environmental interpretation suggests that waste water management should be improved in order to reverse the current situation.

AB The planar structure of river networks exhibits fractal properties. In particular, available data indicate a tendency for drainage areas A to be distributed according to a power law; their boundaries and main channels to form self-affine curves; the characteristic lengths of drainage areas to be independently self-affine in the one-dimensional space Z of total channel length, rendering the network elongated(and anisotropic); the inverse network density A/Z to be either constant or self-affine in Z, depending on whether or not the network fills the two-dimensional space of A; and (as found in a recent study) areas of given size, vegetative cover, and mean steady state soil moisture, weighted by their flow distance from the basin outlet, to be self-affine in the one-dimensional space of this distance. Various theoretical and semiempirical relationships have been proposed among exponents defining some of these and other scale dependencies. Expressions have been proposed for ensemble moments of A and some length measures associated with finite size river basins. We present a new model that views any self-affine basin property, Y(X), as belonging to an infinite hierarchy of mutually uncorrelated, statistically homogeneous random functions defined on elementary subbasins, each of which is characterized by a unique integral(spatial correlation) scale lambda. We cite a mathematically rigorous hydrologic rationale for our model and use it in conjunction with published scaling relations to obtain the probability density function of lambda; to derive analytical expressions for ensemble analogs of Horton's scaling laws; to deduce from them that streams of any Horton-Strahler order omega are associated with integral scales lambda(omega) <= lambda <= lambda(omega+1), where the ratio lambda(omega+1/)lambda(omega) is a constant independent of omega; to develop analytical expressions relating statistical moments of Y(X) to arbitrary lower and upper cutoff scales that may(but need not) be taken to represent data support and maximum watershed size; to describe ways of estimating the corresponding parameters; and to provide a theoretical basis for the heretofore unexplained observation that self-affine amplitude fluctuations of basin boundaries and main channels(as measured by their variance), having a common Hurst exponent, are larger in the former than in the latter.

AB The capacity of shrub canopy water storage is a key factor in controlling the rainfall interception. Thus, it affects a variety of hydrological processes in water-limited arid desert ecosystems. Vast areas of revegetated desert ecosystems in Northwestern China are occupied by shrub and dwarf shrub communities. Yet, data are still scarce regarding their rainwater storage capacity. In this study, simulated rainfall tests were conducted in controlled conditions for three dominant xerophytic shrub types in the arid Tengger Desert. Eight rainfall intensities varying from 1.15 to 11.53 mm h(-1) were used to determine the canopy water storage capacity. The simulated rainfall intensities were selected according to the long-term rainfall records in the study area. The results indicate that canopy storage capacity (expressed in water storage per leaf area, canopy projection area, biomass, and volume of shrub respectively) increased exponentially with increase in rainfall intensity for the selected shrubs. Linear relationships were found between canopy storage capacity and leaf area (LA) or leaf area index (LAI), although there was a striking difference in correlation between storage capacity and LA or LAI of Artemisia ordosica compared to Caragana korshinskii and Hedysarum scoparium. This is a result of differences in biometric characteristics, especially canopy morphology between the shrub species. Pearson correlation coefficient indicated that LA and dry biomass are better predictors as compared to canopy projection area and volume of samples for precise estimation of canopy water storage capacity. In terms of unit leaf area, mean storage capacity was 0.39 mm (range of 0.24-0.53 mm), 0.43 mm (range of 0.28-0.60 mm), and 0.61 mm (range of 0.29-0.89 mm) for C. korshinskii, H. scoparium, and A. ordosica, respectively. Correspondingly, divided per unit dry biomass, mean storage capacity was 0.51 g g(-1) (range of 0.30-0.70 g g(-1)), 0.41 g g(-1) (range of 0.26-0.57 g g(-1)), and 0.73 g g(-1) (range of 0.38-1.05 g g(-1)) for C. korshinskii, H. scoparium, and A. ordosica, respectively, when the rainfall intensities ranged from 1.15, 2.31, 3.46, 4.61, 6.92, 9.23 to 11.53 mm h(-1). The needle-leaved species A. ordosica had a higher canopy water storage capacity than the ovate-leaved species C. korshinskii and H. scoparium at the same magnitude of rainfall intensity, except for C. korshinskii when it was expressed in unit of canopy projection area. Consequently, A. ordosica will generate higher interception losses as compared to C. korshinskii and H. scoparium. This is especially the case as it often forms dense dwarf shrub communities despite its small size. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate implementation of river interactions with subsurface water is critical in large-scale hydrologic models with a constant horizontal grid resolution when models apply kinematic wave approximation for both hillslope and river channel flow. The size of rivers can vary greatly in the model domain, and the implemented grid resolution is too coarse to accurately account for river interactions. Consequently, the flow velocity is under-estimated when the width of the rivers is much narrower than the selected grid size. This leads to inaccuracy and uncertainties in calculations of water quantities. In addition, the rate of exfiltration and infiltration between the river and the subsurface may be overestimated as the modeled area of water exchange between rivers and subsurface is larger than reality. Therefore, the present study tests the approximation of subscale channel flow by a scaled roughness coefficient in the kinematic wave equation. For this purpose, a relationship between grid cell size and river width is used to correct flow velocity, which follows a simplified modification of the Manning-Strickler equation. The rate of exfiltration and infiltration between the subsurface and river is also corrected across riverbeds by a scaled saturated hydraulic conductivity based on the grid resolution even though the grid size is relatively large. The scaling methodology is implemented in a hydrological model coupling ParFlow (PARallel FLOW) v3.5 and the Community Land Model (CLM) v4.5. The model is applied over the Upper Rhine Basin (between France and Germany) for a time period from 2012 to 2014 and at a spatial resolution of 0.055 (~6 km). The validity of the results is examined with satellite and in situ data through an innovative application of the First Order Reliability Method (FORM). The scaling approach shows that soil moisture estimates have improved, particularly in the summer and autumn seasons when cross-validated with independent soil moisture observations provided by the Climate Change Initiative (CCI). The results underline the use of a simple scaling procedure of the Manning coefficient and saturated hydraulic conductivity to account for the real infiltration/ exfiltration rate in large-scale hydrological models with constant horizontal grid resolution. The scaling pro-cedure also shows overall improvements in groundwater level estimation, particularly where the groundwater level is shallow (less than 5 m from the surface). By using the scaling approach, the average bias in soil moisture for the study domain was decreased from 0.17 mm3/mm3 to 0.1 mm3/mm3. The FORM results show that the probability of a substantial divergence between the ParFlow-CLM-S soil moisture results and the CCI-SM observation, which is defined as more than 0.25% of the CCI-SM observation value, is less than 0.05, 0.11, 0.15, and 0.08 for autumn, winter, spring, and summer, respectively.

AB Non-point nitrogen (N) loss from agriculture is an environmental concern among scientists, decision-makers, and the public. This study investigated NO3-N and total N losses from a mixed land use watershed (39.5 ha) in the Appalachian Valley and Ridge Physiographic Province as influenced by hydrology (flow type, runoff volume, storm sizes, and precipitation amount) and seasons (pre-growing, growing, and post-growing seasons) from 2002 to 2006. Stream discharge was monitored every 5-min and water samples for NO3-N and total N analyses were collected weekly for base flow and for every storm. The majority of NO3-N (about 75%) and total N (about 65%) were exported in base flow, which contributed about 64% of the total flow in an average year and had greater flow-weighted mean NO3-N concentration (5.6 mg L-1) than storm flow (3.4 mg L-1). A substantial proportion of total N was in the form of NO3-N in base flow (58.1%) and small storms with <1-year return period (48.4%), suggesting that base flow and small storm flow were probably dominated by NO3-N-rich lateral subsurface flow. As storm size (runoff volume, flow rate, and return period) increased, the NO3-N concentration decreased following a power relationship. In contrast, total N concentration increased with increasing storm size, which was attributed to surface runoff that flushed NH4-N and dissolved and particulate organic N into the stream. The NO3-N and total N losses from this watershed were greater during the pre-growing (January-April) and post-growing (October-December) seasons, which contributed >73% of the overall NO3-N and total N losses. These two seasons also had greater flow-weighted mean NO3-N (4.8 and 5.5 mg L-1, respectively) and total N (9.8 and 10.1 mg L-1, respectively) concentrations and greater discharge (40% and 32% of total discharge, respectively) than during the growing season. Greater contribution of NO3-N to total N loss in storm flow was also observed during the pre-growing and post-growing seasons than during the growing season, while contribution of NO3-N to total N loss in base flow was consistent across seasons. Management practices to reduce N loss from this watershed should target periods of base flow when NO3-N and total N concentrations are greater (before and after the crop growing season) and target areas along the stream where seeps are present, perhaps including perennial plant species in localized riparian buffers and introducing cover crops on the agricultural land during the fallow season.

AB Water consumption demand of winter wheat remains uncertain in humid region of East China. A better prediction of water consumption can improve agricultural water management. Based on the evapotranspiration (ET) data determined by large-weighted lysimeter and the meteorological data during 2011-2018, the actual ET of winter wheat was compared with the ET simulated by Priestley-Taylor (PT), Penman-Monteith (PM) and FAO-56 single crop coefficient (K-c) models, and the relationships between ET of winter wheat and its driving environmental factors were assessed to localize the model's parameters. The results showed that the seasonal variations of ET in winter wheat could be divided into three stages with the canopy development, i.e., Stage I: from sowing to wintering when hourly ET maintained a low level (0.03-0.35 mm/h); Stage II: from revival to dough when hourly ET increased rapidly to 0.60-1.50 mm/h during daytime; Stage III: the ripening stage with hourly ET decreasing to 0.01-1.00 mm/h. The ET of winter wheat was mainly determined by wind speed at Stage I and by net solar radiation (R-n) at Stage II and III by Besides primary determining factor net radiation at the whole season, vapor pressure deficit and air temperature was the second factor that dominated ET at Stages III and Stage III, respectively. The PM model performed excellently for hourly ET modelling at Stage II with R-2 of 0.944 during 2017-2018. All models did not perform well at Stage I and III on hourly time scale. PM model was the best among the three models for calculating daily ET at Stage II, while both PM and PT models could be used to simulate daily ET at Stage III. After local parameterization, the calibrated PTx and K-cx models were validated with daily ET simulation with the coefficients of 1.52 and 1.25 at Stage I, 1.81 and 1.80 at Stage II, and 1.12 and 0.78 at Stage III, respectively. The PTx model was suitable to calculate daily ET at Stage I and III with R-2 of 0.19 and 0.55, MAE of 0.39 and 0.88 mm/d, GPI of 0.59 and 2.93, respectively, while K-cx model was the best model at Stage II, with R-2 of 0.86, MAE of 0.74 mm/d and GPI of 0.22. Moreover, the PTx at Stage I, K-cx at Stage II, and PTx at Stage III appeared to give reasonable results in evaluating seasonal ET of winter wheat, with values of 53.8, 375.8 and 21.0 mm at Stage I, II and III in 2017-2018, respectively. Total ET suggested that the main water management period should be Stage II. The results can improve the simulation of seasonal ET and may be used as a benchmark for water management of winter wheat in East China.

AB In the present context of global changes, considerable efforts have been deployed by the hydrological scientific community to improve our understanding of the impacts of climate fluctuations on water resources. Both observational and modeling studies have been extensively employed to characterize hydrological changes and trends, assess the impact of climate variability or provide future scenarios of water resources. In the aim of a better understanding of hydrological changes, it is of crucial importance to determine how and to what extent trends and long-term oscillations detectable in hydrological variables are linked to global climate oscillations.
   In this work, we develop an approach associating correlation between large and local scales, empirical statistical downscaling and wavelet multiresolution decomposition of monthly precipitation and stream flow over the Seine river watershed, and the North Atlantic sea level pressure (SLP) in order to gain additional insights on the atmospheric patterns associated with the regional hydrology. We hypothesized that: (i) atmospheric patterns may change according to the different temporal wavelengths defining the variability of the signals; and (ii) definition of those hydrological/circulation relationships for each temporal wavelength may improve the determination of large-scale predictors of local variations.
   The results showed that the links between large and local scales were not necessarily constant according to time-scale (i.e. for the different frequencies characterizing the signals), resulting in changing spatial patterns across scales. This was then taken into account by developing an empirical statistical downscaling (ESD) modeling approach, which integrated discrete wavelet multiresolution analysis for reconstructing monthly regional hydrometeorological processes (predictand: precipitation and stream flow on the Seine river catchment) based on a large-scale predictor (SLP over the Euro-Atlantic sector). This approach basically consisted in three steps: 1 - decomposing large-scale climate and hydrological signals (SLP field, precipitation or streamflow) using discrete wavelet multiresolution analysis, 2 - generating a statistical downscaling model per time-scale, 3 - summing up all scale-dependent models in order to obtain a final reconstruction of the predictand. The results obtained revealed a significant improvement of the reconstructions for both precipitation and streamflow when using the multiresolution ESD model instead of basic ESD. In particular, the multiresolution ESD model handled very well the significant changes in variance through time observed in either precipitation or streamflow. For instance, the post-1980 period, which had been characterized by particularly high amplitudes in interannual-to-interdecadal variability associated with alternating flood and extremely low-flow/drought periods (e.g., winter/spring 2001, summer 2003), could not be reconstructed without integrating wavelet multiresolution analysis into the model. In accordance with previous studies, the wavelet components detected in SLP, precipitation and streamflow on interannual to interdecadal time-scales could be interpreted in terms of influence of the Gulf-Stream oceanic front on atmospheric circulation. 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ID BASIN-SCALE; FREQUENCY; EXPONENTS
AB This paper investigates the scaling behaviour of annual flood peaks, exhibited through what is taken to be a power law relationship between mean annual flood and catchment size, E[Q(p)] = cA theta. We also study the dependence on catchment size of the coefficient of variation of annual flood peaks, CV[Qp]. We attempt to interpret these relationships in terms of the interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere - in particular, the effects of temporal variability of rainfall (within-storm patterns, multiple storms and seasonality) and runoff processes (overland flow, subsurface flow and channel flow). The spatial scaling of flood peaks, as expressed by the coefficients c, theta and CV, has been analysed based on, initially, simulated runoff fields produced by a simple linear rainfall-runoff model for hypothetical catchments, and later by a more realistic, distributed model for an actual catchment in the semi-arid, south-west of Western Australia. It is found that the main controls on c and theta are runoff processes, soil depth and mean annual rainfall, with additional controls on c including temporal rainfall variability, the underlying water balance, and the spatial variability of rainfall. Runoff generation at catchment scales can be specified as being fast or slow according to a relative catchment travel time. The scaling exponent theta is high and almost constant with A for slow catchments, where deep soils combined with low annual rainfall leads to domination by subsurface flow. Conversely, theta is lower in fast catchments, where shallow soils combined with high annual rainfall leads to dominance by surface runoff processes with relatively short travel times. The interaction between within-storm patterns and fast runoff processes is the important control on c, clearly shown in small catchments, while multiple storms and seasonality are crucial in large catchments. The presence of multiple runoff processes with a broad spectrum of time scales leads to an increase of CV[Q(p)], as does the introduction of spatial variability of rainfall.

AB This paper assesses the impacts of the Three Gorges Dam, the South-North Water Transfer Project and other water abstractions on the probability of long-duration salt intrusions into the Yangtze River estuary. Studies of intrusions of saltwater into estuaries are typically constrained by both the short duration of discharge records and the paucity of observations of discharge and salinity. Thus, studies of intrusions of saltwater into estuaries typically seek to identify the conditions under which these intrusions occur, using detailed observations for periods of 20-60 days. The paper therefore first demonstrates a method by which to identify the conditions under which intense intrusions of longduration occur and then applies that method to analyse the effect of the three projects. The paper constructs a model of the relationship between salinity and discharge and then employs Monte Carlo simulation methods to reconstruct the probability of observing intrusions of differing intensities and durations in relation to discharge. The model predicts that the duration of intrusions with chlorinity >= 250 mg L-1 (or >= 400 or 500 mg L-1 /increases as the number of consecutive days with discharge <= 12 000 m(3) s(-1) (or <= 8000 m(3) s(-1)/increases. The model predicts that in 1950-2014, the number of consecutive days with chlorinity >= 250 mg L-1 averaged 21.34 yr(-1); if the three projects operate according to their normal rules, that average would rise to 41.20 yr(-1). For a randomly selected year of discharge history from the period 1950-2014, under normal operating rules for these projects the probability of an intrusion rises from 0.25 (for 30-day intrusions) or 0.05 (for 60-day intrusions) to 0.57 or 0.28, respectively.

AB Pool-bar topography in single-channel rivers has a length scale proportional to channel width. In braided rivers confluence-bifurcation units are analogous to pool-bar morphology and, in some cases, develop from initial alternate bars. Consequently, confluence-bifurcation units are expected to have length that scales with the central anabranch width and that constitutes a basic length scale braided channel morphology. This idea was tested using measurements from a physical model of a gravel bed braided river and from aerial photographs of braided rivers. Length (distance from confluence to bifurcation), anabranch width, and confluence angle of confluence-bifurcation units were measured. A simple length scaling is evident across the range of scales; confluence-bifurcation length is 4-5 times the channel width. This scaling is a fundamental element of braided river morphology and suggests that braided patterns are created by processes, and have morphological regularity, similar to pool-bar units of low-sinuosity single-thread rivers.

AB Gas tracer experiments were carried out in dynamically compressed sediments to investigate the mass transfer between a trapped multicomponent gas phase and a mobile water phase. The saturation state of the column was characterized by three independent methods: (1) by gravimetric measurements, (2) by bromide tracer tests, and (3) by hydraulic conductivity measurements. For inverse modeling a new kinetic model was developed allowing volume change of the entrapped gas. The new kinetic model consistently explains oxygen elution curves, the time evolution of the integral gas saturation, and integral hydraulic conductivity. The sensitivity of three different velocity-dependent mass transfer correlations to the dissolution process was investigated: (1) a classical square-root, single-sphere correlation, Sh similar to Pe(0.5), (2) a multisphere correlation, Sh similar to Pe(n) (n = 0.5-1.0), and (3) an empirical correlation, Sh similar to Pe(0.8). It was found that all correlations yield nearly the same elution curves for 10 gas tracer experiments with three different two-component gas phases: O-2/He, O-2/N-2, and O-2/Ar and for different flow velocities ranging from 5 to 20 m d(-1). For all gas tracer experiments a distinct minimum of the longitudinal dispersivity was found during gas dissolution, i. e., in the unsaturated state. For the saturated state we found that the experimental values could be described by Saffman's theory: (D) over tilde (p) proportional to Pe ln (Pe) with a normalized mean square root error of 6%.

AB A strategy recently developed for use in an international study of ground-water flow and transport model validation is applied to Darcy's original experiment. The results of applying the validation strategy indicate that Darcy's law was not validated by Darcy's experiment. However, when the strategy is applied to a similar experiment conducted by Stearns using much smaller hydraulic gradients than Darcy, Darcy's law is found to be "not invalid". In addition, the authors propose that the adequacy of a model for a given purpose, at a given site, may be more important than model validity for making model-based decisions.

AB Validation of large amounts of digital hydrological data and eventual exchange of data between various organisations can benefit from the development of a structured hydrological feature coding system. In this article we describe the development of such a system and present its implementation in the CCM2 structured hydrological feature data set, covering Europe to the Urals and including Turkey. We discuss the coding of river basins, catchments, lakes and rivers. The proposed coding system is largely inspired by the work of Otto Pfafstetter with additions for coding oceans, seas, islands and lakes. Furthermore the coding system can be transferred to features that geometrically intersect the coded hydrological features and we propose some rules on how to establish this transfer.

AB Column experiments were conducted in the laboratory to study the relationship between local-scale colloid filtration parameters and physical heterogeneity as represented by soil or rock hydraulic conductivity. Natural (polydisperse) sand was sieved into distinct classes to produce relatively homogeneous porous media for the experiments. Silica particles 0.45 mu m in diameter were used as the transported colloids. The column experiments were carried out under carefully controlled chemical conditions; The hydraulic conductivity of each packed column was determined using a constant-head permeameter arrangement. Conservative transport parameters (dispersivity and effective porosity) were obtained using a salt tracer. Comparison of solute and colloid breakthrough curves indicated that particle deposition rates were unsteady in the column. This behavior was analyzed using a blocking function which describes the alteration of the sand surface due to the accumulation of deposited colloids. By this method, clean-bed collision efficiency factors were obtained for colloid filtration in each of the sand sizes. An inverse relationship was observed between the collision efficiency factor and the grain size of the collector medium. This relationship was attributed to a variation of surface heterogeneity with sand particle size. This theory is supported by the direct correlation of collision efficiency with surface heterogeneity parameters of the blocking function. The colloid filtration data were used to parameterize a linear correlation between the collision efficiency factor and the natural logarithm of the medium hydraulic conductivity. The collector efficiency, normally calculated from theoretical models for colloid transport in the vicinity of collector grains, was also shown to be a linear function of the natural logarithm of hydraulic conductivity. Correlations of this type can be used effectively in stochastic modeling of colloid transport through heterogeneous porous media.

AB The Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database provides a framework for quantitative, global-scale explorations of the relationship between freshwater resources and international cooperation and conflict. Projects were designed to test common theories linking freshwater resources to cooperation and conflict, in particular within the context of geography and environmental security. The projects, which follow in sequence, consider three main hypotheses on the likelihood and intensity of water resource disputes. To test these hypotheses, a unique set of tools was created that links water-specific event data with a geographic information system (GIS) that meshes biophysical, political, and socioeconomic data sets at the river basin and other scales. There are three linked data sets: (1) an event data set documenting historical water relations, including a methodology for identifying and classifying events by their intensity of cooperation/ conflict; (2) a GIS data set of countries and international basins, both current and historical; and (3) a spatial data set of biophysical, socioeconomic, and political variables, linked to the GIS. This paper describes the hypotheses, the above tools created to test them, and a methodological framework for utilizing the linked event and GIS data sets, providing three projects as examples: (1) indicators of international basins at risk of political tensions, ( 2) relationships between internal and international hydropolitics in three geographic regions, and (3) hydroclimatological variables and international water relations.

AB The streamwater chemistry of four catchments at Prades and one catchment at Montseny (NE Spain) is described and the relationships between streamwater alkalinity, pH and pCO2 with discharge and that between pH and alkalinity are highlighted.  At Montseny, results from a subsurface seepage are also presented.  The Prades and Montseny catchments have similar vegetation (dense forest of holm oak, Quercus ilex L.) and lithology (phyllites).  However, the catchments differ strongly in their hydrological behaviour:  only 8-15% of the rainfall passes to the stream from the two gauged Prades catchments, whereas the Montseny catchment provides 50% of rainfall to the stream.  Hence the mineralization of streamwaters is much higher in the Prades catchments.  All the streams studied show an inverse relationship between alkalinity and discharge.  Although pH also decreases with discharge in the Montseny catchment, it remains high during high flows in the Prades catchments.  The Prades streamwater chemistries are determined by the solubility equilibrium of calcite:  at high flows alkalinity decreases and, as a result of calcite solubility controls, this change results in an increase in pH.  Consequently, pH and log(alkalinity) are either negatively correlated or uncorrelated in the Prades streams.  At Montseny, the relationship between pH and alkalinity is significantly positive:  calcite solubility controls do not come into play.  All waters analyzed show an excess pCO2 (epCO2) with respect to atmospheric concentrations.  The highest epCO2 values usually correspond to low flows.  However, study of the variation of epCO2 during 15 individual storm events sampled at Montseny shows that epCO2 increases with discharge.  At Prades, the degassing of epCO2 in the stream channel produces calcite precipitation.

DT Article

   law
AB In earlier experiments on steady infiltration into crust-topped soil columns an additional resistance was observed in the vicinity of the boundary between the crust and the soil below it. I have performed laboratory tests in order to check the following hypothesis: high hydraulic resistance of the crust results in steep drop of the water pressure between the top and bottom part of the crust if water flows through the crust-topped soil. The concentration of dissolved air in water depends upon the pressure acting on water according to linear Henry's law. I am assuming that air is released in small, microscopic air bubbles at the bottom part of the crust due to a substantial drop of the pressure. The microbubbles are then blocking a part of micropores of the crust. Consequently, hydraulic resistance of the crust increases. In laboratory experiments, the crust-topped soil was modeled by ceramic plate of high resistance placed on the top of the sand, or alternatively of loamy loess columns. Unsteady infiltration into crust-topped soil was repeatedly realized with Dirichlet's boundary condition and the plate resistance was measured at each selected time of infiltration. How in the whole system saturated by water was performed and resistance of the system was measured, too. Hydraulic resistance of the plate was rising with time during infiltration. The increase of hydraulic resistance was more expressed when water infiltrated into crust-topped initially dry sand than in experiments with sand of initially high water content. Resistance increasing with time was measured in nearly saturated systems, too. The hypothesis was therefore macroscopically proved. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Snow accumulation and melt are the two most important processes contributing to the spring freshet, the main hydrological event in snow-dominated watersheds. The magnitude and timing of the spring freshet is determined by the spatial variability of melt rates and peak snow water equivalent (SWE). Although it is known that the spatial variability of SWE is controlled by topography and vegetation, their combined influence on snow accumulation and melt at the watershed-scale has only been addressed in a few studies. The high small-scale variability of a snowpack combined with the classical sampling technique along transects makes it difficult to estimate how much of the observed spatial variability in SWE can be attributed to topographic and vegetative controls such as elevation, aspect, wind, and forest type, and how much of it is local variability. A nested stratified sampling design was developed for the snow courses in this study, where small-scale variability at the plot-scale was integrated by 12 snow density and 60 snow depth measurements, while the variability at the watershed-scale was captured by 19 strata, defined by elevation, aspect, and forest cover (either clearcut or forest). Snow course sampling was carried out during the spring of 2005, a year with 25% below average snow accumulation, and in spring of 2006, a year with 25% above average snow accumulation for the region. Snow accumulation in both years and snowmelt for a period in the spring of 2006 are analysed with multiple linear regressions and spatial autocorrelation of SWE with variogram analysis. The combination of elevation, aspect, and forest cover explained about 80-90% of the large-scale variability in snow accumulation for both years. At the plot-scale the coefficient of variation was higher under the forest canopy than in clearcuts, but did not relate to topographic controls. Elevation had the greatest influence on SWE in both years, with a steeper gradient in the snow rich year, whereas aspect had a similar effect in both years. In the mild winter of 2005, forests accumulated 39% less snow than clearcuts, while in 2006, forests had 27% less snow than clearcuts. Relative to the mean, aspect had a greater influence on snow accumulation than forest cover in the mild winter of 2005. Elevation played the most important role in snowmelt, while both aspect and forest cover had a comparable effect with slightly less influence than elevation. Almost all variograms show a clear sill, confirming that in the majority of cases, a 60 x 60 m plot size was adequate in capturing the variability of the plot-scale. In general, the degree of spatial autocorrelations is persistent in the snowmelt season for both years. This study has shown that it is possible to separate large-scale variability created by topography and forest cover from plot-scale variability through specifically designed snow surveys. The methods and data set of this study are useful in testing spatially-distributed snowmelt models and in developing new algorithms that reflect the relationships between the factors controlling the spatial variability of SWE.

AB In the Sahel, recycling of moisture through evapotranspiration appears to be responsible for more than 90% of the rainfall. As a result, there exists an important feedback mechanism between land-use and climate, which has immediate implications for the management of natural resources. The challenge is to find sustainable combinations of land-use and vegetation that maximize recycling of moisture, while at the same time allowing adequate agricultural production. In this paper, a theory of moisture recycling is presented including the derivation of moisture recycling indicators, one of which is based on the salinity of the rainfall. Subsequently, the theory is verified with observations of rainfall and runoff in the Sahel over the period 1950-1990.

AB Rainfall intensity-frequency-duration (IFD) relationships are commonly required for the design and planning of water supply and management systems around the world. Currently, IFD information is based on the "stationary climate assumption" that weather at any point in time will vary randomly and that the underlying climate statistics (including both averages and extremes) will remain constant irrespective of the period of record. However, the validity of this assumption has been questioned over the last 15 years, particularly in Australia, following an improved understanding of the significant impact of climate variability and change occurring on interannual to multidecadal timescales. This paper provides evidence of regime shifts in annual maximum rainfall time series (between 1913-2010) using 96 daily rainfall stations and 66 sub-daily rainfall stations across Australia. Furthermore, the effect of these regime shifts on the resulting IFD estimates are explored for three long-term (1913-2010) sub-daily rainfall records (Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne) utilizing insights into multidecadal climate variability. It is demonstrated that IFD relationships may under-or over-estimate the design rainfall depending on the length and time period spanned by the rainfall data used to develop the IFD information. It is recommended that regime shifts in annual maximum rainfall be explicitly considered and appropriately treated in the ongoing revisions of the Engineers Australia guide to estimating and utilizing IFD information, Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR), and that clear guidance needs to be provided on how to deal with the issue of regime shifts in extreme events (irrespective of whether this is due to natural or anthropogenic climate change). The findings of our study also have important implications for other regions of the world that exhibit considerable hydroclimatic variability and where IFD information is based on relatively short data sets.

ID PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; SCALING MODEL; RAINFALL
AB Assessing the relationship between the intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) of extreme precipitation is required for the design of water management systems. However, when modeling sub-daily precipitation extremes, there are commonly only short observation time series available. This problem can be overcome by applying the duration-dependent formulation of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution which fits an IDF model with a range of durations simultaneously. The originally proposed durationdependent GEV model exhibits a power-law-like behavior of the quantiles and takes care of a deviation from this scaling relation (curvature) for sub-hourly durations (Koutsoyiannis et al., 1998). We suggest that a more flexible model might be required to model a wide range of durations (1 min to 5 d). Therefore, we extend the model with the following two features: (i) different slopes for different quantiles (multiscaling) and (ii) the deviation from the power law for large durations (flattening), which is newly introduced in this study. Based on the quantile skill score, we investigate the performance of the resulting flexible model with respect to the benefit of the individual features (curvature, multiscaling, and flattening) with simulated and empirical data. We provide detailed information on the duration and probability ranges for which specific features or a systematic combination of features leads to improvements for stations in a case study area in the Wupper catchment (Germany). Our results show that allowing curvature or multiscaling improves the model only for very short or long durations, respectively, but leads to disadvantages in modeling the other duration ranges. In contrast, allowing flattening on average leads to an improvement for medium durations between 1 h and 1 d, without affecting other duration regimes. Overall, the new parametric form offers a flexible and enhanced performance model for consistently describing IDF relations over a wide range of durations, which has not been done before as most existing studies focus on durations longer than 1 h or day and do not address the deviation from the power law for very long durations (2-5 d).

AB A transient two-dimensional mathematical model was developed using an advection-dispersion equation to describe the dissolution and transport of slightly water-soluble compounds (SWSCs) from a pool of light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) into an aquifer. The LNAPL pool is located in a capillary fringe, and the bottom of the pool is in direct contact with the aquifer. In the LNAPL pool, SWSCs are assumed to move by liquid diffusion, and within the aquifer by mass flow under the influence of steady horizontal groundwater flow. The dissolution process along the LNAPL/water interface assumed a local phase equilibrium relation. A formal analytical solution to the mathematical model was first derived in the Laplace transform domain and inverted numerically by means of the Bellman algorithm. This solution was used to calculate the dissolution of a SWSC from an LNAPL pool to groundwater and to identify physicochemical factors that could significantly affect this transient mass transfer process. Results show that within the range of parameters we used in the study, the SWSC flux, which is represented by the modified Damkohler number <(Da(t))over bar>, can be related to the Fourier number F-o the transverse hydrodynamic Peclet number Pe(T), and the ratio of nonaqueous diffusion Peclet number Pe(N) to Pe(T) (or D-T/D-N) through a simple power law relationship.

AB In the context of international environmental law and International Water Law (IWL), the Ecosystem Approach (EA) has become a source of heated debate. In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the negative impacts that human activities have on freshwater ecosystems. Accordingly, the protection of such ecosystems has been identified as integral to ensuring the good governance of water resources. This article reviews key areas of research around the conceptualization and application of EA. First, we adopt a holistic approach to the concept of EA when applied to existing environmental challenges, before exploring the issues that arise when applying EA to water-based ecosystems. Next, we assess the effectiveness of implementing EA in the management of environmental issues linked to transboundary water contexts. Our findings indicate that International Environmental Law, which applies a sector-specific approach, poses challenges for the instrumental implementation of EA because the latter requires a holistic approach to resource management. Furthermore, in transboundary water contexts the competing needs of river-basin countries are also identified as key factors complicating the implementation of EA. The article concludes with recommendations for policy makers and scholars.

AB Recently, a series of laboratory experiments was carried out in which a typical variable-density flow problem in a porous medium was investigated. A stable layering of saltwater below freshwater is affected by the recharge and discharge of freshwater on the top. The experiments were conducted with 1% and 10% initial salt-mass fraction contrasts. In this paper, we define a mathematical model problem, which is able to reproduce the experimental results within a reasonable accuracy, To this end, the sensitivity of the model with respect to model parameters is investigated. An inverse modelling leads to an appropriate choice of the model parameters and the definition of the mathematical benchmark problem. It will become clear that, in the 10% case, the transversal dispersion coefficient plays an important role. Detailed numerical investigations are carried out and reference solutions are obtained. For the high concentration case a very high spatial grid resolution using up to 16 million grid points is necessary. Error bounds are derived for the solutions without any a priori assumption on regularity and convergence, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The variation in soil texture, surface moisture or vertical soil moisture gradient in larger scale atmospheric models may lead to significant variations in simulated surface fluxes of water and heat. The parameterization of soil moisture fluxes at spatial scales compatible with the grid size of distributed hydrological models and mesoscale atmospheric models (similar to 100 km(2)) faces principal problems which relate to the underlying microscopic or field scale heterogeneity in soil characteristics.
   The most widely used parameterization in soil hydrology, the Darcy-Richards (DR) equation, is gaining increasing importance in mesoscale and climate modelling. This is mainly due to the need to introduce plant-interactive soil water depletion and stomatal conductance parameterizations and to improve the calculation of deep percolation and runoff. Covering a grid of several hundreds of square kilometres, the DR parameterization in such soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer schemes (SVATs) is assumed to be scale-invariant. The parameters describing the non-linear, area-average soil hydraulic functions in this scale-invariant DR-equation should be treated as calibration-parameters, which do not necessarily have a physical meaning. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is one of the soil parameters to which the models show very high sensitivity. It is shown that saturated hydraulic conductivity can be scaled in both vertical and horizontal directions for large flow domains.
   In this paper, a distinction is made between effective and aggregated soil parameters. Effective parameters are defined as area-average values or distributions over a domain with a single, distinct textural soil type. They can be obtained by scaling or inverse modelling. Aggregated soil parameters represent grid-domains with several textural soil types. In soil science dimensional methods have been developed to scale up soil hydraulic characteristics. With some specific assumptions, these techniques can be extrapolated from classical field-scale problems in soil heterogeneity to larger domains, compatible with the grid-size of large scale models. Particularly promising is the estimation of effective soil hydraulic parameters from area averaging measurements through inverse modelling of the unsaturated flow.
   Techniques to scale and aggregate the soil characteristics presented in this paper qualify for direct or indirect use in large scale meteorological models. One of the interesting results is the effective behaviour of the reference curve, which can be obtained from similar media scaling. If the conclusions of this paper survive further studies, a relatively simple method will become available to parameterize soil variability at large scales. The inverse technique is found to provide effective soil parameters which perform well in predicting both the area-average evaporation and the area-average soil moisture fluxes, such as subsurface runoff. This is not the case for aggregated soil parameters. Obtained from regression relationships between soil textural composition and hydraulic characteristics, these aggregated parameters predict evaporation fluxes well, but fail to predict water balance terms such as percolation and runoff. This is a serious drawback which could eventually hamper the improvement of the representation of the hydrological cycle in mesoscale atmospheric model and in GCMs. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A hydrochemical-isotopic investigation of the Laizhou Bay Quaternary aquifer in north China provides new insights into the hydrodynamic and geochemical relationships between freshwater, seawater and brine at different depths in coastal sediments. Saltwater intrusion mainly occurs due to two cones of depression caused by concentrated exploitation of fresh groundwater in the south, and brine water for salt production in the north. Groundwater is characterized by hydrochemical zonation of water types (ranging from Ca-HCO3 to Na-Cl) from south to north, controlled by migration and mixing of saline water bodies with the regional groundwater. The strong adherence of the majority of ion/Cl ratios to mixing lines between freshwater and saline water end-members (brine or seawater) indicates the importance of mixing under natural and/or anthropogenic influences. Examination of the groundwater stable isotope delta O-18 and delta H-2 values (between -9.5 parts per thousand and -3.0 parts per thousand and -75 parts per thousand and -40 parts per thousand, respectively) and chloride contents (similar to 2 to 1000 meq/L) of the groundwater indicate that the saline end-member is brine rather than seawater, and most groundwater samples plot on mixing trajectories between fresh groundwater (delta O-18 of between -6.0 parts per thousand and -9.0 parts per thousand; Cl < 5 meq/L) and sampled brines (delta O-18 of approximately -3.0 parts per thousand and Cl > 1000 meq/L). Locally elevated Na/Cl ratios likely result from ion exchange in areas of long-term freshening. The brines, with radiocarbon activities of similar to 30 to 60 pMC likely formed during the Holocene as a result of the sequence of transgression-regression and evaporation: while deep, fresh groundwater with depleted stable isotopic values (delta O-18 = -9.7 parts per thousand and delta H-2 = -71 parts per thousand) and low radiocarbon activity (<20 pMC) was probably recharged during a cooler period in the late Pleistocene, as is common throughout northern China. An increase in the salinity and tritium concentration in some shallow groundwater sampled in the 1990s and re-sampled here indicates that intensive brine extraction has locally resulted in rapid mixing of young, fresh groundwater and saline brine. The 6180 and delta H-2 values of brines (similar to-3.0 parts per thousand and -35 parts per thousand) are much lower than that of modern seawater, which could be explained by 1) mixing of original (5180 enriched) brine that was more saline than presently observed, with fresh groundwater recharged by precipitation and/or 2) dilution of the palaeo-seawater with continental runoff prior to and/or during brine formation. The first mechanism is supported by relatively high Br/Cl molar ratios (1.7 x 10(-3)-2.5 x 10(-3)) in brine water compared with similar to 1.5 x 10(-3) in seawater, which could indicate that the brines originally reached halite saturation and were subsequently diluted with fresher groundwater over the long-term. Decreasing C-14 activities with increasing sampling depth and increasing proximity to the coastline indicate that the south coastal aquifer in Laizhou Bay is dominated by regional lateral flow, on millennial timescales.

AB The dynamics of fluid displacement in porous media often affect phase entrapment and shape macroscopic transport properties and thus are of considerable interest for a range of natural and engineering applications. The macroscopic motion of a displacement front is composed of numerous abrupt pore-scale invasion events that involve rapid interfacial jumps and reconfigurations with associated mechanical and interfacial energy release detectable as acoustic emissions (AE). We conducted systematic experiments of fluid displacement and measured associated AE during passage of fluid fronts (primarily drainage) within assemblies of glass beads of different sizes. Results indicated distinct acoustic signatures associated with different displacement processes, reflecting dependency on porous media pore size, displacement flow rate, and liquid properties. The rich AE signals associated with front dynamics exhibited power law relationships between the number of AE events and their amplitudes, reminiscent of avalanche-like invasion processes. In addition to AE signals emanating from rapid emptying or filling of pores (Haines jumps), other processes such as redistribution and interfacial reconfigurations behind a drainage front and grain rearrangement may generate AE. Characteristic AE signatures generated by displacement processes in different media and under various boundary conditions offer a promise for remote detection of pore-scale fluid interfacial dynamics in porous media that may shape macroscopic transport properties (e. g., linked with phase entrapment).

AB This paper, the first of two parts [see Abrams and Loague, this issue], takes the compartmentalized approach for the geochemical evolution of redox zones presented by Abrams et al. [1998] and embeds it within a solute transport framework. In this paper the compartmentalized approach is generalized to facilitate the description of its incorporation into a solute transport simulator. An equivalent formulation is developed which removes any discontinuities that may occur when switching compartments. Rate-limited redox reactions are modeled with a modified Monod relationship that allows either the organic substrate or the electron acceptor to be the rate-limiting reactant. Thermodynamic constraints are used to inhibit lower-energy redox reactions from occurring under infeasible geochemical conditions without imposing equilibrium on the lower-energy reactions. The procedure used allows any redox reaction to be simulated as being kinetically limited or thermodynamically limited, depending on local geochemical conditions. Empirical reaction inhibition methods are not needed. The sequential iteration approach (SIA), a technique which allows the number of solute transport equations to be reduced, is adopted to solve the coupled geochemical/solute transport problem. When the compartmentalized approach is embedded within the SIA, with the total analytical concentration of each component as the dependent variable in the transport equation, it is possible to reduce the number of transport equations even further than with the unmodified SIA. A one-dimensional, coupled geochemical/solute transport simulation is presented in which redox zones evolve dynamically in time and space. The compartmentalized solute transport (COMPTRAN) model described in this paper enables the development of redox zones to be simulated under both kinetic and thermodynamic constraints. The modular design of COMPTRAN facilitates the use of many different,, preexisting solute transport and geochemical codes. The companion paper [Abrams and Loague, this issue] presents examples of the application of COMPTRAN to field-scale problems.

AB Using the same data set as in Part I of this series (obtained from a dense rain gauge network operating with 15 s sampling over the period September 1991 to December 1993). the rainfall climatology of Norfolk Island is examined in terms of the relationship between rainfall accumulations R and fractional time raining (FTR) F In addition. linear. cubic and power-law fits to the relationship are used as estimators and compared with actual monthly mean rainfall totals at integrations of I h, I day and I month. Cumulative errors in estimated island mean rainfall are compared as a function of both the monthly march and as a function of increasing F. It is shown that F may be used successfully to provide estimates of rainfall accumulation even at the shortest integration time (when the R-F relationship is non-linear) by way of the cubic fit. Temporal variations in the fitting parameters are found to be similar at each gauge site and spatial differences in fitting parameters between sites are systematic. On a year-by-year basis. the mean rainfall per FTR was found to decrease Lit all sites. A high correlation between the two parameters of the power-law, fitting method enables R and F to be related using a single-parameter. though estimates are generally inferior to the linear or cubic fit. Using integration times of 12, 24, 48 and 96 h. the data set was sampled at intervals between 15 s (the present gauge array resolution) and 1800 s (a typical remote sensing resolution) providing R-F correlation trends and mean rainfall per unit F. Outputs from the sampling could not be normalized in terms of an integration-to-sampling time ratio. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Nonlinear storage-discharge relations may explain important hydrologic features frequently observed under a variety of environmental conditions. In this paper the catchment dynamic storage problem is addressed by incorporating nonlinear storage-discharge relations in a stochastic framework to derive the statistical distribution and the duration curve of streamflows in river basins. Such a goal is achieved by extending recent analytical solutions for the seasonal probability distribution of discharges derived from the stochastic description of soil moisture dynamics at basin scales. Long-term probability density functions (pdf's) and flow duration curves are expressed through climatic, ecohydrologic, and geomorphic parameters of the basin by relaxing the linear reservoir assumption of subsurface flow components conveniently made in previous studies. In particular, this paper focuses on three different types of nonlinear, algebraic relationships between instantaneous discharges and storage volumes (concave and convex power laws and hyperbolic). Exact expressions of the streamflow pdf are derived in all cases, which are also tested by numerical simulations. Streamflow statistics and duration curves, estimates of catchment dynamic storages, recession timescales, and sensitivity to the underlying rainfall regime are then discussed. The model shows that different shapes of the streamflow pdf (bell shaped, monotonously decreasing, and bimodal) arise depending on the degree of nonlinearity of the storage-discharge relation, providing a new approach to catchment hydrology characterization.

AB This paper examines the sensitivity of a hydrological model to several methods of spatial interpolation of rainfall data. The question is investigated in a context of scarcity of data over a large West African catchment (100,000 km(2)) subject to a drastic trend of rain deficit since the 1970s. Thirteen widely scattered rainfall stations and their daily time series were used to interpolate gridded rainfall surfaces over the 1950-1992 period via various methods: Thiessen polygons, inverse distance weighted (IDW) method, thin smooth plate splines (spline), and ordinary kriging. The accuracy of these interpolated datasets was evaluated using two complementary approaches. First, a point-by-point assessment was conducted, involving comparison of the interpolated values by reference to observed point data. Second, a conceptual rainfall-runoff model (Hydrostrahler) was used in order to assess whether and to what extent the alternative sets of interpolated rainfall impacted on the hydrological simulations. A lumped modelling exercise over a tong period (1952-1992) and a semi-distributed exercise over a short period (1971-1976) were performed, using calibrations aimed at optimizing a Nash-Sutcliffe criterion. The results were evaluated for each interpolated forcing dataset using statistical analysis and visual inspection of the simulated and observed hydrographs and the parameters obtained from calibration. Assessment of the interpolation methods by reference to point data indicates that interpolations using the IDW and kriging methods are more efficient than the simple Thiessen technique, and, to a lesser extent, than spline. The use of these data in a daily lumped modelling application shows a different ranking of the various interpolation methods with regard to various hydrological assessments. The model is particularly sensitive to the differences in the rainfall input volume produced by each interpolation method: the IDW dataset yields the highest hydrological efficiency white the spline dataset gets the poorest results. Although the calibration procedure makes it possible to partly compensate for the differences (or errors) between rain input datasets, the semi-distributed hydrological model remains sensitive to volumetric and spatial differences. Then, assessment of these combined differences through the sensitivity of the semi-distributed model provides us with more complete discrimination between the interpolated data inputs. The output results at the basin outlet do not decrease between the lumped and semi-distributed modelling exercises with the IDW and kriging datasets, in contrast to the Thiessen and spline datasets, which tends to indicate the superiority of the former two interpolated inputs. In this hydrological application, the IDW dataset is still shown to provide the most realistic results. Moreover, despite the scarcity of rainfall data, coherent semi-distributed values of the model parameters are obtained by calibration over a large gradient of climate conditions. Finally, it is observed that although the model reproduced the rainfall-runoff relationship before 1970 very well, regardless of which interpolated datasets were used, it was not able to satisfactorily simulate the basin behaviour after the change in rainfall regime. This inability needs further investigation and is the subject of ongoing research. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   MODEL
AB A stochastic model of rainfall rate is used to examine the temporal variability of rainfall during heavy convective rain periods. The model represents the microstructure of rainfall rate at time scales that are important for land surface processes associated with infiltration and runoff production. The representation of rainfall rate is based on a marked point process model of raindrop size distributions, which yields a gamma raindrop spectrum with parameters that are time-varying stochastic processes. Raindrop size distribution observations from a Joss-Waldvogel disdrometer in Princeton, New Jersey, during the period May-October 2006 are used along with the stochastic model to examine rainfall rate variability. Analyses focus on a sample of 60-min time periods in which heavy convective rainfall occurred. Central elements of the analyses entail examination of the relationships between rainfall rate and the time-varying model parameters that characterize the raindrop size distribution. We also examine the dependence structure among these processes. "Scaling law'' formulations of raindrop size distributions are used to examine variability of raindrop size distributions. Analyses of the Princeton heavy rainfall periods also point to seasonal and diurnal heterogeneities as important elements of the distribution of extreme rainfall rates. Convective intensity, as reflected in cloud-to-ground lightning observations, plays an important role in the distribution of extreme rainfall rates and the evolution of raindrop size distributions associated with heavy rainfall.

AB In this paper, optimal operating rules for water quality management in reservoir-river systems are developed using a methodology combining a water quality simulation model and a stochastic GA-based conflict resolution technique. As different decision-makers and stakeholders are involved in the water quality management in reservoir-river systems, a new stochastic form of the Nash bargaining theory is used to resolve the existing conflict of interests related to water supply to different demands, allocated water quality and waste load allocation in downstream river. The expected value of the Nash product is considered as the objective function of the model which can incorporate the inherent uncertainty of reservoir inflow. A water quality simulation model is also developed to simulate the thermal stratification cycle in the reservoir, the quality of releases from different outlets as well as the temporal and spatial variation of the pollutants in the downstream river. In this study, a Varying Chromosome Length Genetic Algorithm (VLGA), which has computational advantages comparing to other alternative models, is used. VLGA provides a good initial solution for Simple Genetic Algorithms and comparing to Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) reduces the number of state transitions checked in each stage. The proposed model, which is called Stochastic Varying Chromosome Length Genetic Algorithm with water Quality constraints (SVLGAQ), is applied to the Ghomrud Reservoir-River system in the central part of Iran. The results show, the proposed model for reservoir operation and waste load allocation can reduce the salinity of the allocated water demands as well as the salinity build-up in the reservoir.

AB Quantifying relationships between stream water quality and catchment land uses is a major goal of many water quality monitoring programs. This is a challenging task that is rarely achieved through simple analysis of raw data alone. Multiple regression analysis provides one approach, which despite significant limitations, can be successful when very large data sets are available and only annual estimates are required. However, regression techniques have limited application to sub-annual data sets.
   We present a new method for isolating the water quality responses of different land uses from monitoring data through hydrological model calibration, using a process of simultaneous calibration at several monitoring sites. In addition to model parameters, model algorithm complexity and the number of land-attribute groups are also used as calibration 'parameters'. This helps increase model parameter uniqueness and model predictive certainty. We applied the technique to water quality data from the Johnstone River catchment (1602 km(2)) in north-east Australia, using the HSPF model. The data comprised > 4000 samples from over five years of monitoring at 16 sites, which drained sub-catchments of differing land area and proportions of each land use. Monitoring occurred at flow gauging sites during high stream flows, and regularly at all sites during non-event periods. Variables modelled included discharge, suspended sediment, and various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. The calibration process aimed to maximise both goodness-of-fit and parameter sensitivity. We achieved a substantial simplification of HSPF algorithms without appreciable reduction in goodness-of-fit, by a combination of: fixing parameters, tying parameters, and introducing new, simpler equations. Two key calibration tools were reducing the number of land-use groups (by combining land uses) and tying parameters between the three flow paths modelled (surface flow, interflow and base flow). These in turn removed insensitive parameters, increased the sensitivity of remaining parameters, and increased model predictive power. For calibration of suspended sediment, we found our conceptual model was too complex for the information content of the data, so it was necessary to group certain land uses and simplify algorithms in HSPF. In contrast, for nitrate, our conceptual model was too simple, with successful calibration requiring a finer resolution of land use in the catchment.
   A major advantage of our technique is that it can isolate land-use effects from stream monitoring data on a modelling time step that is unachievable by regression analysis, with a sensitivity that enables detection of relatively small differences in time and/or space. The technique also enhances confidence in estimates, it identifies 'sensitive' and 'insensitive' parameters and processes, and it provides a robust calibration by reducing the parameter solution space. Further, by using a hydrological model the technique can account for spatial and temporal variation in land use and rainfall. It is also predictive, so it can be used to assess impacts of land-use-change scenarios within the catchment. Additionally, it can provide insights into the type and amount of data required to isolate land-use effects on different water quality parameters, which can be used to enhance the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the monitoring program design.

AB Random realizations of three-dimensional exponentially correlated hydraulic conductivity fields are used in a finite-difference numerical flow model to calculate the mean and covariance of the corresponding Lagrangian-velocity fields. The dispersivity of the porous medium is then determined from the Lagrangian-velocity statistics using the Taylor definition. This estimation procedure is exact, except for numerical errors, and the results are used to assess the accuracy of various first-order dispersion theories in both isotropic and anisotropic porous media. The results show that the Dagan theory is by far the most robust in both isotropic and anisotropic media, producing accurate values of the principal dispersivity components for sigma gamma as high as 1.0. In the case of anisotropic media where the flow is at an angle to the principal axis of hydraulic conductivity, it is shown that the dispersivity tensor is rotated away from the how direction in the non-Fickian phase, but eventually coincides with the flow direction in the Fickian phase.

TI Synthesizing the impacts of baseflow contribution on

AB Understanding concentration-discharge (C - Q) relationships can inform catchment solute and particulate export processes. Previous studies have shown that the extent to which baseflow contributes to streamflow can affect C-Q relationships in some catchments. However, the current understanding on the effects of baseflow contribution in shaping the C-Q patterns is largely derived from temperate catchments. As such, we still lack quantitative understanding of these effects across a wide range of climates (e.g. arid, tropical and subtropical). The study aims to assess how baseflow contributions, as defined by the median and the range of daily baseflow indices within individual catchments (BFI_m and BEI_range, respectively), influence C-Q slopes across 157 catchments in Australia spanning five climate zones. This study focuses on six water quality variables: electrical conductivity (EC), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total suspended solids (TSS), the sum of nitrate and nitrite (NO,) and total nitrogen (TN). The impact of baseflow contributions is explored with a novel Bayesian hierarchical model.
   For sediments and nutrient species (TSS, NOx, TN and TP), we generally see largely positive C-Q slopes, which suggest a dominance of mobilization export patterns. Further, for TSS, NOx and TP we see stronger mobilization (steeper positive C-Q slopes) in catchments with higher values in both the BEI_m and BFI range, as these two metrics are positively correlated for most catchments. The enhanced mobilization in catchments with higher BEI_m or BEI_range is likely due to the more variable flow pathways that occur in catchments with higher baseflow contributions. These variable flow pathways can lead to higher concentration gradients between low flows and high flows, where the former is generally dominated by groundwater/slow subsurface flow while the latter by surface water sources, respectively. This result highlights the crucial role of flow pathways in determining catchment exports of solutes and particulates. Our study also demonstrates the need for further studies on how the temporal variations of flow regimes and baseflow contributions influence flow pathways and the potential impacts of these flow pathways on catchment C-Q relationships.

AB To study relationships between soil hydraulic properties and soil structural properties, a computer micro model of soil is constructed. We present first a general method of building a two-dimensional porous structure, including both pores and particles, with different levels of aggregation resulting from a fragmentation process. A fractal structure is obtained when self similarity is imposed over the successive scales of fragmentation. Emphasis is put upon the modeling of the retention curve. A classical capillary model and methods taken from percolation theory enable us to simulate qualitatively the primary and secondary loops of this hysteretic curve. In the fractal case, theoretical analytical expressions proposed for adjusting retention data are tested, The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is also calculated on the same simulated soil by analogy with an electrical network. The soil structures are deformable and simulation proves to be a useful tool to investigate the behavior of swelling soils.

AB Saturated groundwater flow can often be described by the law of mass conservation and Darcy's law, i.e. by a potential flow problem. An accurate approximation of the specific discharge can be determined by the mixed finite element method. In this article the lowest-order mixed method is presented including its hybridization, which results in a sparse symmetric positive definite system of linear equations. This system can be solved efficiently by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. After approximating the specific discharge, streamlines and residence times can be determined easily and accurately. The applicability and advantages of the mixed finite element method are illustrated for three potential how problems for HYDROCOIN Level 1.

AB It has long been known that surface gravity waves induce significant seepage through the porous layer found at the lake bottom. Away from coastal regions, however, the pressure signature of surface waves at the lake bottom is weak. We consider fully nonlinear internal gravity waves, whose long wavelength and slow motion implies a sustained and strong pressure perturbation even in the deep regions of the lake. We argue that internal waves can induce significant seepage through the sediment layer, in regions where surface gravity waves have negligible impact. The pressure profile at the fluid-porous layer interface is computed from the "exact" Dubreil-Jacotin-Long theory, giving a reliable profile even for large waves. This profile is used in conjunction with Darcy's law to compute the seepage within the porous region. We find that the geometric distribution of seepage is strongly controlled by both the ratio of porous media thickness to the horizontal length of the pressure perturbation, and the bottom topography, when it is present. Based on work on the interaction of internal solitary waves with the bottom boundary layer, we develop a model to account for the changes in permeability due to wave-induced instabilities in the bottom boundary layer and enhanced benthic turbulence. This turbulence acts to unplug the pores near the surface by lifting the detritus that clogs them. The resulting changes in permeability significantly enhance exchange between the free fluid and the porous medium on the downstream side of the wave.

AB Large, episodic inputs of coarse sediment (sediment pulses) in forested, mountain streams may result in changes in the size and arrangement of bed forms and in channel roughness. A conceptual model of channel organization delineates trajectories of response to sediment pulses for many types of gravel bed channels. Channels exhibited self-organizing behavior to various degrees based on channel gradient, presence of large in-channel wood or other forcing elements, the size of the sediment pulse, and the number of bed-mobilizing flows since disturbance. Typical channel changes following a sediment pulse were initial decreases in water depth, in variability of bed elevations, and in the regularity of bed form spacing. Trajectories of change subsequently showed increased average water depth, more variable and complex bed topography, and increased uniformity of bed form spacing. Bed form spacing in streams with abundant forcing elements developed at a shorter spatial scale (two to five channel widths) than in streams without such forcing mechanisms (five to 10 channel widths). Channel roughness increased as bed forms developed.

AB In this paper, theoretical relationships are established between the impulse response to the injection of tracer and the steady state flow rate in a pipe.  This approach is a step toward the analysis of non-linear systems.  For different scales of transfer, the impulse responses were defined from short-time injection.  Impulse responses were also calculated by representing mass transfer in porous media by the 'random walk method', which enabled us to verify relationships in unsteady flow conditions.  The validity of these relationships has been quantitatively assessed by applying it to tracer experiments in a column in the laboratory at different flow rates.

AB This study of the active bacteria residing in a pristine confined aquifer provides unexpected insights into the ecology of iron-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria in the subsurface. At 18 wells, we trapped the microbes that attached to aquifer sediment and used molecular techniques to examine the bacterial populations. We used multivariate statistics to compare the composition of bacterial communities among the wells with respect to the chemistry of the groundwater. We found groundwater at each well was considerably richer in ferrous iron than sulfide, indicating iron-reducing bacteria should, by established criteria, dominate the sulfate reducers. Our results show, however, that areas where groundwater contains more than a negligible amount of sulfate (>0.03 mM), populations related to sulfate reducers of the genera Desulfobacter and Desulfobulbus were of nearly equal abundance with putative iron reducers related to Geobacter, Geothrix, and Desulfuromonas. Whereas sulfate is a key discriminant of bacterial community structure, we observed no statistical relationship between the distribution of bacterial populations in this aquifer and the concentration of either ferrous iron or dissolved sulfide. These results call into question the validity of using the relative concentration of these two ions to predict the nature of bacterial activity in an aquifer. Sulfate reducers and iron reducers do not appear to be segregated into discrete zones in the aquifer, as would be predicted by the theory of competitive exclusion. Instead, we find the two groups coexist in the subsurface in what we suggest is a mutualistic relationship.

ID BEND THEORY; FLOW
AB The theory for flow and sediment transport in a curved channel that was presented by Sun et al. [this issue], paper I of this two-part study, was used to develop a computer model for meandering rivers with multiple sediment grain sizes. The model, which is based on the linear theory of Johannesson and Parker [1989] for meandering rivers, takes into account the effects of alternate bars. Therefore this is one of the first models that can be used to simulate bar-bend interactions and their relationships with both the initial growth and the long-term development of meandering rivers. Unlike the previous theoretical studies of Blondeaux and Seminara [1985] and Johannesson and Parker [1989], the results show that the initial growth of meandering rivers is controlled primarily by the curvature-related instabilities, and the influence of alternate bars on the initial development of meander loops appears to be negligible. The simulations also show that under certain conditions, meandering rivers do evolve toward a "resonant" state. It appears that finite amplitude perturbations are needed to enhance the initial development of alternate bars in the channel in order for the river to develop toward a bar-bend resonance state. The model includes the transport and sorting of sediment with a distribution of grain sizes. Heterogeneities in the sedimentary material deposited in the floodplain, as a result of meandering river migration, are realistically simulated.

AB Steep, soil-mantled hillslopes evolve through the downslope movement of soil, driven largely by slope-dependent transport processes. Most landscape evolution models represent hillslope transport by linear diffusion, in which rates of sediment transport are proportional to slope, such that equilibrium hillslopes should have constant curvature between divides and channels. On many soil-mantled hillslopes, however, curvature appears to vary systematically, such that slopes are typically convex near the divide and become increasingly planar downslope. This suggests that linear diffusion is not an adequate model to describe the entire morphology of soil-mantled hillslopes. Here we show that the interaction between local disturbances (such as rainsplash and biogenic activity) and frictional and gravitational forces results in a diffusive transport law that depends nonlinearly on hillslope gradient. Our proposed transport law (1) approximates linear diffusion at low gradients and (2) indicates that sediment Aux increases rapidly as gradient approaches a critical value. We calibrated and tested this transport law using high-resolution topographic data from the Oregon Coast Range. These data, obtained by airborne laser altimetry, allow us to characterize hillslope morphology at approximate to 2 m scale. At five small basins in our study area, hillslope curvature approaches zero with increasing gradient, consistent with our proposed nonlinear diffusive transport law. Hillslope gradients tend to cluster near values for which sediment flux increases rapidly with slope, such that large changes in erosion rate will correspond to small changes in gradient. Therefore average hillslope gradient is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of rates of tectonic forcing or baselevel lowering. Where hillslope erosion is dominated by nonlinear diffusion, rates of tectonic forcing will be more reliably reflected in hillslope curvature near the divide rather than average hillslope gradient.

ID PHYSICALLY BASED MODEL; HETEROGENEOUS HILLSLOPES; BASEFLOW SEPARATION;
   RECESSION; AQUIFERS; DRAINAGE
AB An important problem in scientific hydrology is accounting for the effect of small-scale heterogeneity in lumped representations of flow through landscapes. In this work we investigate the effect of lateral variations in hydraulic conductivity on saturated subsurface lateral flow through hillslopes using an idealized model based on the Boussinesq equation. The model simulates flow over an impervious planar base through heterogeneous conductivity fields in response to simple recharge inputs and periodic recharge events. The results indicate that the hillslope-scale response depends on the relative importance of topographic and water table potential gradients driving flow. The relative magnitude of these drivers is related to a dimensionless variable (eta) over bar. Where water table gradients dominate, a network of flow paths channel flow through the hillslope toward high-conductivity areas, and the response is primarily dependent on the boundary condition at the toe of the hillslope. Where the topographic gradients dominate, the flow is delayed by low-conductivity areas, producing a power law-like response, suggesting that high exponents in observed storage-discharge relations may be traced to the presence of heterogeneity in the landscape. These observations suggest that the nature of the lumped hillslope-scale hydrologic models depends on the emergent behaviors that arise at that scale as a result of the interactions between hillslope properties (including their variability in space), the relationship between the hillslopes and their surrounding landscape elements (through the boundary conditions), and the temporal variability of the recharge that enters the system.

TI HYDRAULIC RESPONSE OF HIGHLY COMPRESSIBLE AQUITARDS DURING CONSOLIDATION
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPACTION; SIMULATION
AB The transient hydraulic behavior of highly compressible aquitards is investigated through numerical analysis and field studies.  Variations in the hydraulic parameters of an aquitard during consolidation are accounted for by incorporating empirical relationships derived from standard consolidation tests into the one-dimensional flow equation.  The resulting equation is highly nonlinear.  The hydraulic response of an aquitard with physical properties typical of the compressible clays of Mexico City is evaluated with both standard linear analysis and with a nonlinear approach where the hydraulic parameters are stress-dependent.  The results indicate that decreases in the hydraulic diffusivity of the aquitard due to consolidation lead to diminished leakage flux, slower groundwater velocities and solute transport rates, longer transient response periods and less land subsidence than would be predicted by classical linear theory.  Evaluation of field data from a site near Mexico City indicates that significant interpretive errors may arise if the stress dependence of the hydraulic parameters is ignored in these types of systems.

AB This paper assesses one of many potential enhancements to conventional flood forecasting that can be achieved through the use of soft computing technologies. A methodology is outlined in which the forecasting data set is split into subsets before training with a series of neural networks. These networks are then recombined via a rule-based fuzzy logic model that has been optimized using a genetic algorithm. The methodology is demonstrated using historical time series data from the Ouse River catchment in northern England. The model forecasts are assessed on global performance statistics and on a more specific flood-related evaluation measure, and they are compared to benchmarks from a statistical model and naive predictions. The overall results indicate that this methodology may provide a well performing, low-cost solution, which may be readily integrated into existing operational flood forecasting and warning systems.

ID POROUS-MEDIA; PERMEABILITY; AQUIFERS; MODEL
AB Most groundwater flow models are not sufficiently detailed to allow an explicit representation of all dynamical scales. Instead, most models are constructed at such a coarse scale of resolution that unresolved subgrid variability often exists. It is therefore important to understand the interaction between unresolved dynamics and explicitly resolved dynamics. The concept of universality is central to this interaction and is here related to the problem of rescaling models of groundwater flow. We examine when it is possible to construct an accurate model for the explicitly resolved large scales, without an explicit description of the subgrid scale dynamics. We demonstrate how unresolved subgrid scale dynamics interact with resolved scale dynamics. We show that a universally valid resolved scale model can be constructed if the resolved dynamics are sufficiently independent of the details of the subgrid scale dynamics. In that event, a resolved scale model is composed of a universal structure and accompanying model parameters. The model parameters represent the effect of unresolved dynamics upon resolved dynamics. We examine two possible model structures for groundwater flow. We show theoretically, and numerically, that a local Darcy law is a universally valid resolved scale model if the resolved and subgrid scales of the hydraulic conductivity are separated in scale by a so-called spectral gap. If, however, the hydraulic conductivity possesses many scales of variability, then a more general nonlocal Darcy law is a more appropriate model structure. When the nonlocal Darcy's law is more appropriate, numerical experiments suggest that errors using a local Darcy's law with effective parameters are most significant at the smallest resolving scale of the model, and are minimal at scales between 8 and 16 times the resolving scale.

AB Experimental evidence demonstrating gravity-driven wetting front instability in an initially dry natural fracture is presented. An experimental approach is developed using a transparent analog rough-walled fracture to explore gravity-driven instability. Three different boundary conditions were observed to produce unstable fronts in the analog fracture: application of fluid at less than the imbibition capacity, inversion of a density-stratified system, and redistribution of flow at the cessation of stable infiltration. The redistribution boundary condition (analogous to the cessation of ponded infiltration) is considered in a series of systematic experiments. Gravitational gradient and magnitude of the fluid input were varied during experimentation. Qualitative observations imply that finger development is strongly correlated to the structure of the imbibition front at the onset of flow redistribution. Measurements of fingertip velocity are used to develop a first-order relationship with fingertip length. Measured finger width is compared to theoretical predictions based on linear stability theory.

AB Existing flow resistance relationships for mountain rivers maybe in error by typically 30%. In part this is because flow resistance is a complex phenomenon, not easy to quantify with the available data. However, a further reason is the reliance of past analyses on fitting relationships to data from multiple sites, hence emphasizing an averaging between-site variation. A more scientific approach is to derive separate at-a-site relationships and investigate how they can be collapsed into a single formula. Twenty-seven carefully selected field datasets from seven literature sources are therefore analysed empirically to show at-a-site variations in resistance, with the aim of improving the accuracy and applicability of mountain river flow resistance relationships. Considering only the bed grain roughness, the principal factors likely to determine flow resistance are identified as relative submergence d/D-84 (where d is depth and D-84 is the bed material 84-percentile size), bed material size, distribution and channel slope. The dependency of the resistance function (8/f)(1/2) (where f is the Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient) on d/D84 is more accurately described by a power law than by a semi-logarithmic law, especially at high flows. From observations of coincident at-a-site datasets, two equations are derived, distinguished largely according to channel slope S. For S < 0.8%, (8/f)(1/2) = 3.84(d/D-84)(0.547) (r(2) = 0.986). For S > 0.8% (8/f)(1/2) = 3.10(d/D-84)(0.93) (r(2) = 0.959). These equations appear to define minimum values for flow resistance, probably for ideal conditions of bed grain roughness and uniform flow. Deviations from this ideal (because of form roughness, nonuniform flow or bank effects) will increase resistance in a manner which is not yet quantified. The equations therefore have a very specific applicability and are not generally applicable to all flows. The cause of the slope dependency remains unclear, nor is any dependency on bed material size distribution identified. Nevertheless the high correlation coefficients suggest an improved accuracy compared with other field-based relationships. The equations are derived for in-bank flows with d/D-84 < 11 and slopes in the range 0.2-4%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ephemeral streams are highly dependent on rainfall and terrain characteristics and, therefore, very sensitive to minor changes in these environments. The western Mediterranean area exhibits a highly irregular precipitation regime with a great variety of rainfall events driving the flow generation on intermittent watercourses, and future climate change scenarios depict a lower magnitude and higher intensity of precipitation in this area, potentially leading to severe changes in flows. We explored the rainfall-runoff relationships in two semi-arid watersheds in southern Spain (Algeciras and Upper Mula) to model the different types of rainfall events required to generate new flow in both intermittent streams. We used a non-linear approach through generalized additive models at event scale in terms of magnitude, duration, and intensity, contextualizing resulting thresholds in a long-term perspective through the calculation of return periods. Results showed that the average similar to 1.2 d and < 1.5mm event was not enough to create new flows. At least a 4 d event ranging from 4 to 20 mm, depending on the watershed, was needed to ensure new flow at a high probability (95 %). While these thresholds represented low return periods, the great irregularity of annual precipitation and rainfall characteristics makes prediction highly uncertain. Almost a third of the rainfall events resulted in similar flow to or lower flow than the previous day, emphasizing the importance of lithological and terrain characteristics that lead to differences in flow generation between the watersheds.

AB A new model has been developed here, incorporating prospective run theory to predict events based on order statistics. The difference equations for such a system are presented and the closed form solution is obtained in terms of parameters to which the practising hydrologist has access. Predictions are provided for duration of maximum drought lengths as a function of the definition of drought, the number of years over which the prediction is made, and the probability of inadequate water resources.

TI Instabilities in variable density flows: Stability and sensitivity
   analyses for homogeneous and heterogeneous media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID POROUS-MEDIA; SIMULATION; GENERATION; TRANSPORT
AB This study improves our understanding of instability phenomena that may accompany the transport of dense plumes of dissolved contaminants. One major objective is to test how well analytic stability theory developed by List [1965] applies to the transport of dense plumes in both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. The data to test the prediction come from numerical model experiments in which instability growth is generated by perturbing the interface between fluids of differing density. Stability criteria, as determined by the transverse Rayleigh number, the ratio of transverse to longitudinal Rayleigh numbers, and the nondimensional wave number compare very well with results observed in the numerical experiments for isotropic media. Comparisons involving correlated random fields were much less successful because plume stability is determined on a local basis as a function of the changing permeability field. Instabilities tend to dissipate in zones of lower permeability and grow in zones of higher permeability. Another objective of the study is to determine the factors that contribute to stability and instability in homogeneous aad heterogeneous systems. Sensitivity analyses using a transport model within the framework of List's stability theory show that stability is promoted by low medium permeability, small density differences; and significant dispersion. In heterogeneous media, stability is promoted by increased correlation length scales and increased log permeability variance. Furthermore, the simulations illustrate the intimate relationship that exists between instability growth and decay and the heterogeneous nature df the permeability field. Thus stability criteria that do not incorporate characteristics of the permeability field will not be suitable for natural or field-scale porous media.

AB The coastal zone is not only a terrestrial-marine buffer system but also the main site of the organic matter decomposition process, which complicates the identification of the sources of bioactive elements (C, N and S) and the factors that control C-N-S cycling. Here, a multi-isotope approach is developed to distinguish C, N and S sources and the associated geochemical processes in a coastal aquifer system of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. The PRD is characterized as a typical multilayer groundwater system with a reducing environment in the confined aquifers and an oxidizing environment in the unconfined aquifer. For the groundwater samples from the unconfined aquifer, the delta N-15 values showed that the ammonium and nitrate originated from manure and sewage, the delta C-13-DIC indicated that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was mainly derived from soil CO2 and weathering of carbonate rocks, and the delta S-34 and delta O-18 signals of sulfate suggested that SO42- originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate. The oxidizing environment and the positive relationship between delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- suggested that nitrification and de nitrification were the key factors influencing the transformation of nitrogen in the unconfined aquifer. No obvious correlation between C, N and S content and isotopic composition suggested C-N-S was loosely coupled in this aquifer.
   For the groundwater samples in the confined aquifers, the delta D-H2O and delta O-18-H2O signals suggested that partially confined groundwater samples were affected by seawater intrusion. In the non-seawater intrusion region (NSI zone), the C, N and S content combined with C, N and S isotopic composition indicated that ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter, sulfate mainly originated from rock weathering, and DIC mainly originated from carbonate mineral dissolution and the CO2 produced by organic matter mineralization. Extremely high CH4 concentrations suggested the existence of methanogenesis, while the molar ratio of CH4/(CH4 + (1 + alpha) x CO2) indicated that both acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction were ubiquitous. CO2 reduction had a stronger isotopic fractionation effect on the delta C-13-DIC values, thus, the relatively high delta C-13-DIC values were observed. The electron acceptor was the key factor for organic matter mineralization, and CO2 acted as the main electron acceptor in the NSI Zone. Accordingly, acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release in the NSI zone. In the seawater intrusion region (SI zone), ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter, sulfate was derived from the mixing of fresh water and seawater, and DIC was derived from carbonate mineral dissolution, seawater and the CO2 produced by organic matter mineralization. The delta S-34-SO42- showed a positive correlation with delta O-18-SO42- and a negative correlation with SO42-, suggesting the existence of bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). High CH4 concentrations also suggested the existence of methanogenesis. The CH4/(CH4 + (1 + alpha) x CO2) ratios indicated that CO2 reduction existed in more than half of the confined groundwater samples in the SI zone. C-N-S was highly coupled in this region because both BSR and methanogenesis can increase the DIC content, while BSR enriches lighter carbon isotopes and methanogenesis enriches heavier carbon isotopes; thus, a wide range of delta C-13-DIC values was found in SI zone. Sulfate or both sulfate and CO2 were the electron acceptors. Accordingly, acetate fermentation, sulfur reduction and CO2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in the SI Zone. However, the exhaustion of sulfate will make CO2 reduction the key factor for organic matter mineralization in the future.

AB [1] What is the relationship between the visual attributes of a rock sample and its permeability, and how might such information be used in aquifer/reservoir characterization? We investigated these questions by way of three meter-scale blocks of rock, two sandstones, and one volcanic tuff. Each rock exhibits visual and permeability patterns that differ in geometry, intensity, and scale. Using a gas minipermeameter, hundreds to thousands of permeability values were collected on grids at centimeter-scale resolution from each block face and compared to the digital visual image of the same face. We found no significant direct correlation between the permeability measurements and any objective textural measure drawn from the corresponding digital images, despite the obvious resemblance of the permeability maps and visual images. Hypothesizing that the human eye relies on spatial correlation to synthesize information, we calculated and compared semivariograms for both the maps and the images. Semivariogram shape, anisotropy ratio, and principal axes orientation were consistent for the maps and images of each rock but different between rocks. To explore this similarity further, we compared discrete features appearing in map/image pairs, using a difference of Gaussian edge filter to segment (i.e., delineate) the spatial features. The filter consistently colocated visually sharp features, such as sedimentological bounding surfaces, in both the map and the image. Additionally, cumulative distribution functions characterizing the size, shape, and orientation of the segmented features were statistically indistinguishable between a permeability map and its corresponding visual image but statistically different between rocks. These results suggest that it may not always be possible to use visual images (photographs or scans) of outcrops to directly map permeability, even with a training set of punctual permeability data. In particular, defining such relations may be difficult where the scales of analysis and/or intensity of heterogeneity are limited (e. g., within a given facies) as is the case here. Where direct mapping is not possible, these results suggest that visual images can still be used to delineate spatial permeability patterns, especially to locate boundaries where sharp permeability contrasts occur. Other surrogate measurements of permeability, in particular the various geophysical methods, may exhibit similar behavior.

TI COMPARISON OF DIFFUSE DISCHARGE FROM SHALLOW-WATER TABLES IN SOILS AND

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID GROUNDWATER MOUND; EVAPORATION; AUSTRALIA; SURFACE; PLAYA
AB Diffuse (evaporative) discharge of ground water is of interest in the management of local or regional ground waters, and soil salinity. However, past studies show that discharge may vary greatly between soils in agricultural areas and salt flats for similar water table depths. Low discharge from salt flats has been previously attributed to the effect of salt crusts, yet possible soil hydrological reasons for these differences have not been examined. Steady-state hydraulic theory describing the relationship between discharge and water table depth is reviewed. The minimum water table depths required for the theory to be applied are defined in terms of soil parameters. Relationships between discharge and water table depth are then used to analyse the results of previous diffuse discharge studies. It is shown that discharge from both bare agricultural soils and salt flats is consistent with this theory. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of three salt flat soils, determined from measurements of discharge and soil matric suction, showed that low discharge fluxes recorded from the sites were due to low soil permeability. The relationship between discharge flux and water table depth calculated for these sites also described discharge from other salt flats, implying that low hydraulic conductivity caused low discharge from these areas as well. The reasons for the low hydraulic conductivity of salt flat soils are not clear, and need to be investigated to determine if it is a general property of soils in these areas, or results from the high salinity levels.

AB In this study, we make use of a nonstationary stochastic theory in studying solute flux through spatially nonstationary flows in porous media. The nonstationarity of flow stems from various sources, such as multi-scale, nonstationary medium features and complex hydraulic boundary conditions. These flow nonstationarities are beyond the applicable range of the "classical' stochastic theory for stationary flow fields, but widely exist in natural media. In this study, the stochastic frames for flow and transport are developed through an analytical analysis while the solutions are obtained with a numerical method. This approach combines the stochastic concept with the flexibility of the numerical method in. handling medium nonstationarity and boundary/initial conditions. It provides a practical way for applying stochastic theory to solute transport in complex groundwater environments. This approach is demonstrated through some synthetic cases of solute transport in multi-scale media as well as some hypothetical scenarios of solute transport in the groundwater below the Yucca Mountain project areas It is shown that the spatial variations of mean log-conductivity and correlation function significantly affect the mean and variance of solute flux. Even for a stationary medium, complex hydraulic boundary conditions may result in a nonstationary flow field. How nonstationarity and/or nonuniform distribution of initial plume (geometry and/or density) may lead to nonGaussian behaviors (with multiple peaks) for mean and variance of the solute flux. The calculated standard deviation of solute flux is generally larger than its mean value, which implies that real solute fluxes may significantly deviate from the mean predictions.

AB While the calibration-free complementary relationship (CR) has performed excellently in predicting terrestrial evapotranspiration (ETa), how to determine the Priestley-Taylor coefficient (alpha e) is a remaining question. In this work, we evaluated this highly utilizable method, which only requires atmospheric data, with in situ flux observations and basin-scale water-balance estimates (ETwb) in Australia, proposing how to constrain it with a traditional Budyko equation for ungauged locations. We found that the CR method with a constant alpha e transferred from fractional wet areas performed poorly in reproducing the mean annual ETwb in unregulated river basins, and it underperformed advanced physical, machine-learning, and land surface models in closing grid-scale water balance. This problem was remedied by linking the CR method with a traditional Budyko equation that allowed for an upscaling of the optimal alpha e from gauged basins to ungauged locations. The combined CR-Budyko framework enabled us to reflect climate conditions in alpha e, leading to more plausible ETa estimates in ungauged areas. The spatially varying alpha e conditioned by local climates enabled the CR method to outperform the three ETa models in reproducing the grid-scale ETwb across the Australian continent. We argued here that the polynomial CR with a constant alpha e could result in biased ETa, and it can be constrained by a traditional Budyko equation for improvement.

AB Data for several river networks show algebraically decaying distribution functions for the mean annual discharge and the dissipation rate (Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1992). We derived relation between the exponent alpha in the integrated mean annual discharge distribution P(Q greater than or equal to q) similar to q(-alpha) and the topological dimension D-t of the network, alpha = 1 - 1/D-t. Using the experimentally determined value D-t approximate to 1.8 (Tarboton et al., 1988) we find alpha approximate to 0.45, in good agreement with the data of (Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1992). For the random model (Shreve, 1967, 1969; Smart and Werner, 1974) we find an exponent of 1/2.

TI Origin of the Colorado River experimental flood in Grand Canyon
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB The Colorado River is one of the most highly regulated and extensively utilized rivers in the world. Total reservoir storage is approximately four times the mean annual runoff of similar to 17 x 10(9) m(3) year(-1). Reservoir storage and regulation have decreased annual peak discharges and hydroelectric power generation has increased daily flow variability. In recent years, the incidental impacts of this development have become apparent especially along the Colorado River through Grand Canyon National Park downstream from Glen Canyon Dam and caused widespread concern. Since the completion of Glen Canyon Dam, the number and size of sand bars, which are used by recreational river runners and form the habitat for native fishes, have decreased substantially. Following an extensive hydrological and geomorphic investigation, an experimental flood release from the Glen Canyon Dam was proposed to determine whether sand bars would be rebuilt by a relatively brief period of flow substantially greater than the normal operating regime. This proposed release however, was constrained by the Law of the River, the body of law developed over 70 years to control and distribute Colorado River water, the needs of hydropower users and those dependent upon hydropower revenues, and the physical constraints of the dam itself. A compromise was reached following often difficult negotiations and an experimental flood to rebuild sand bars was released in 1996. This flood, and the process by which it came about, fives hope to resolving the difficult and pervasive problem of allocation of water resources among competing interests.

TI 2-D MODELING PROCEDURES FOR ICE COVER THERMAL DECAY
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The computational procedures of a two-dimensional numerical model for ice cover thermal decay are presented.  Applications to side discharge thermal effluents are used to test the model capability of evaluating and predicting the extent of ice cover melting under varying hydrodynamic and thermal conditions.  The theoretical formulation of the model is based on the application of the heat conservation law where thermal exchanges between the river, ice cover, and the atmosphere are accounted for.  The 2-D time-dependent shallow water equations govern the river flow hydrodynamics, while the heat transport process is simulated using the unsteady 2-D energy equation.  In order to properly account for the effects of river flow on the melting process, mass, momentum and heat conservation laws are fully coupled.  The two-dimensional character of the equations is required by the nature of the physical phenoman involved in ice cover melting and thermal decay.

DT Article
ID SPATIAL VARIABILITY; GROUNDWATER-FLOW; MEDIA
AB In numerical simulations of flow through heterogeneous formations, the domain is partitioned into numerical elements. The solution requires assigning physical properties to each numerical block. The process of transferring information from the scale of actual heterogeneity to that of the numerical elements is known as upscaling. We consider steady, one-phase flow and the only property of interest is the permeability, which is regarded as a random space function, and the same is true for the upscaled conductivity. In this paper we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions to be satisfied by upscaling. The necessary conditions are expressed with the aid of the global response of the formation, e.g., the total flux caused by a constant pressure head drop applied on the boundaries. The requirement is that the expected value and the variance of the total flux are the same in the actual and upscaled domains. These are supplemented by local conditions which stipulate that space averages of flow variables over the numerical blocks in the upscaled domain tend to those in the actual formation when the elements size tends to 0. The result of this analysis is that the upscaled permeability must be such as to ensure the equality. in a statistical sense, between the space averaged dissipation in the two media. By assuming an unbounded domain, average uniform flow and stationarity, simplified relationships between the moments of the dissipation in the upscaled and actual media are derived. It is shown that the effective permeability of the two media is the same, The approach is illustrated for stratified formations for which exact composition rules are possible. Even in this simple case the upscaled permeability is a tensor, characterized at second order by two mean components and three covariance functions.

TI State and irrigation: archeological and textual evidence of water
   management in late Bronze Age China
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
LA English
DT Review
ID YELLOW-RIVER
AB Ancient China remains an important case to investigate the relationship between statecraft development and 'total power.' While important economic and social developments were achieved in the late Neolithic, it was not until the late Bronze Age (first millennium BC) that state-run irrigation systems began to be built. Construction of large-scale irrigation projects, along with walls and defensive facilities, became vital to regional states who were frequently involved in chaotic warfare and desperate to increase food production to feed the growing population. Some of the irrigation infrastructures were brought into light by recent archeological surveys. We scrutinize fast accumulating archeological evidence and review rich historical accounts on late Bronze Age irrigation systems. While the credibility of historical documents is often questioned, with a robust integration with archeological data, they provide important information to understand functions and maintenance of the irrigation projects. We investigate structure and organization of large-scale irrigation systems built and run by states and their importance to understanding dynamic trajectories to social power in late Bronze Age China. Cleverly designed based on local environmental and hydrological conditions, these projects fundamentally changed water management and farming patterns, with dramatic ecological consequences in different states. Special bureaucratic divisions were created and laws were made to further enhance the functioning of these large-scale irrigation systems. We argue that they significantly increased productivity by converting previously unoccupied land into fertile ground and pushed population threshold to a new level. A hypothesis should be tested in further archeological research. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Multivariate Extreme Value models are a fundamental tool in order to assess potentially dangerous events. Exploiting recent theoretical developments in the theory of Copulas, new multiparameter models can be easily constructed. In this paper we suggest several strategies in order to estimate the parameters of the selected copula, according to different criteria: these may use a single station approach, or a cluster strategy, or exploit all the pair-wise relationships between the available gauge stations. An application to flood data is also illustrated and discussed.

AB This work analyzes the effects of flooding and fire stress on a wetland energy balance during the dry season of the Orinoco lowlands. The effect of flooding for burning conditions is evaluated by comparing flux measurements in a flooded/burned (T1) and an unflooded/burned (T3) stand, and the effect of burning for flooding conditions by distinguishing between a flooded/ burned (T1) and a flooded/unburned (T2) stand. These examined factors affect the canopy features related to coverage and aerodynamic forcing conditions. The effect of flooding on the average daily radiative budget for the burned stands is to decrease the average daily albedo from 0.14 for the unflooded stand (T3) to 0.08 for the flooded stand (T1). Whereas, the effect of burning for the flooded stands decreases the average daily albedo from 0.16 for the unburned stand (T2) to 0.08 in the burned stand (T1). Furthermore, changes in surface temperature determine variations in the average daily output of long-wave ratios between stands with the most average daily net loss of long-wave radiation (-36.3 MJ m(-2) day(-1)) corresponding to the flooded/burned stand (T1). In the stands, the changes in albedo and surface temperature lead to variation in the available energy. Thus, the average daily net radiation (R-n) is affected by burning of the flooded stands, bring 15.2 MJ m(-2) day(-1) in T1 and 14.7 MJ m(-2) day(-1) in T2. The effect of flooding on the average daily R-n is evident when compared T1 to T3 (13.1 MJ m(-2) day(-1)). The partitioning of R-n into sensible (H) and latent (LE) hear. flux over the three stands is measured simultaneously using the Bowen ratio/gradient method, which is temporally corroborated by means of the eddy covariance approach. Results indicate that average daily LE to average daily R-n ratio is 0.78, 0.78 and 0.80 for T1, T2 and T3, respectively. However, the partitioning of average daily LE into transpiration and evaporation is affected clearly by the analyzed factors. Thus, burning reduces the transpiration rate from -8.5 to -3.3 MJ m(-2) day(-1) for the flooded stands (T2 and T1, respectively). Whereas, flooding varies only a small amount the average daily transpiration rate in the burned stands (T1 and T2) (-3.3 and -3.4 MJ m(-2) day(-1)). Over the stands, the average daily H in relation to R-n for T1, T2 and T3 was 0.19, 0.21 and 0.22, respectively. In relation to the net storage heat flux (Delta SH), the water table at or above the sediments is a small heat sink as the radiation intercepted by the canopies is relatively large. The average daily net storage heat flux is enhanced slightly in the flooded stand (T1) as compared to that for the unflooded/burned stand (T3), Whereas, in the surface of the unburned stand, Delta SH is in thermical equilibrium. Evaluation of evapotranspiration models as a function of the of hourly LE measured over the three stands, indicates that the Penman evapotranspiration model for equilibrium is appropriated for modeling long-term evapotranspiration, and therefore LE is controlled mainly by the available energy and temperature. However, the slope is above 1 (1.11, 1.12 and 1.04 for T1, T2 and T3, respectively). This possible surface control on the results is corroborated by the Penman-Monteith and Slatyer-McIlroy model for a negligible surface resistance. The modeled Values are over-predicted and consequently surface resistance affects partially the results.
   The effect of the areal surface resistance on wetland potential evapotranspiration is assessed as the wetland is surrounded by a dry savanna environment. The relationship between wetland potential evaporation and savanna evaporation is evaluated using the Lhomme closed-box model of the convective boundary layer. The results indicate that the savanna surface resistance enhances the wetland potential evaporation at equilibrium. The results reported in this analysis are pertinent to similar Orinoco wetlands, nevertheless the controls and functioning of herbaceous wetlands under the described land-use practices are revealing common features for wetlands surrounded by regional savannas in South America.

   VALIDATION; ENTROPY; MODELS; SYSTEM
AB Probabilistic predictions are becoming increasingly popular in hydrology. Equally important are methods to test such predictions, given the topical debate on uncertainty analysis in hydrology. Also in the special case of hydrological forecasting, there is still discussion about which scores to use for their evaluation. In this paper, we propose to use information theory as the central framework to evaluate predictions. From this perspective, we hope to shed some light on what verification scores measure and should measure. We start from the "divergence score", a relative entropy measure that was recently found to be an appropriate measure for forecast quality. An interpretation of a decomposition of this measure provides insight in additive relations between climatological uncertainty, correct information, wrong information and remaining uncertainty. When the score is applied to deterministic forecasts, it follows that these increase uncertainty to infinity. In practice, however, deterministic forecasts tend to be judged far more mildly and are widely used. We resolve this paradoxical result by proposing that deterministic forecasts either are implicitly probabilistic or are implicitly evaluated with an underlying decision problem or utility in mind. We further propose that calibration of models representing a hydrological system should be the based on information-theoretical scores, because this allows extracting all information from the observations and avoids learning from information that is not there. Calibration based on maximizing utility for society trains an implicit decision model rather than the forecasting system itself. This inevitably results in a loss or distortion of information in the data and more risk of overfitting, possibly leading to less valuable and informative forecasts. We also show this in an example. The final conclusion is that models should preferably be explicitly probabilistic and calibrated to maximize the information they provide.

AB The trapezoidal relationship between land surface temperature (T-s) and Vegetation Index (VI) was used to estimate soil moisture in the present study. An iterative algorithm is proposed to estimate the vertices of the T-s similar to VI trapezoid theoretically for each pixel, and then Water Deficit Index (WDI) is calculated based on the T-s similar to VI trapezoid using MODIS remotely sensed measurements of surface temperature and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The capability of using WDI based on T-s similar to VI trapezoid to estimate soil moisture is evaluated using soil moisture observations and antecedent precipitation in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in Arizona, USA. The result shows that, the T-s similar to VI trapezoid based WDI can capture temporal variation in surface soil moisture well, but the capability of detecting spatial variation is poor for such a semi-arid region as WGEW.

AB This paper presents a time series prediction scheme using time-delay neural networks combined with chaos theory. To achieve reliable multi-step-ahead prediction, the optimal architecture of networks is determined by average mutual information and false nearest neighbors analyses in chaos theory. The networks are applied to predict the model errors at four measurement stations in the Singapore Regional Model domain, with five prediction horizons ranging from 2 h to 96 h. It is found that the combined scheme significantly improves the accuracy of tidal prediction, with more than 70% of the root mean square errors removed for 2 h tidal forecast and more than 50% for 96 h tidal forecast.

TI SEDIMENT DELIVERY PROCESSES AT BASIN-SCALE
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Since eroded sediments are produced from different sources distributed throughout a basin, sediment delivery processes at basin scale have to be modelled by a spatially distributed approach. In this paper a new theoretically based relationship is proposed for evaluating the sediment delivery ratio, SDR(i), of each morphological unit, i, into which a basin is divided. Then, using the sediment balance equation written for the basin outlet, a relationship between the basin sediment delivery ratio, SDR(w) and the SDR(i) is deduced. This relationship is shown to be independent of the soil erosion model used. Finally, a morphological criterion for estimating a coefficient, beta, is proposed.

TI Fuzzy learning decomposition for the scheduling of hydroelectric power

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID TERM
AB paper presents a nonlinear multivariable fitting model to decompose the optimal policies obtained by dynamic programming of a unique aggregated reservoir. The nonlinear functions are generated using radial basis functions (RBF) neural networks. In this method the potential energy of all the reservoirs in the hydropower system is added to form one equivalent reservoir. The operating policy of the equivalent reservoir is determined by stochastic dynamic programming, and finally the operating rules of each reservoir are determined using RBF neural networks. To improve the multivariable representation of the data, a series of piecewise RBF neural networks is determined using clustering analysis. A fuzzy clustering approach is used to determine the RBF's parameters. This approach has the advantages of being fast and simple to implement with well-established convergence properties. It also has a good representation of the covariance matrix, since all the data belong to all the classes at the same time with different membership grades. A comparison with the back propagation learning and principal components techniques is also reported for Quebec's La Grande River installations. As a result, the proposed approach gives satisfactory operating rules compared with principal component analysis, and the CPU time is reduced by a factor of 15 to 20 compared with the back propagation technique.

AB Optimal operation models for a hydropower system using new fuzzy multiobjective mathematical programming models are developed and evaluated in this study. The models use (i) mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) with binary variables and (ii) integrate a new turbine unit commitment formulation along with water quality constraints used for evaluation of reservoir downstream impairment. Reardon method used in solution of genetic algorithm optimization problems forms the basis for development of a new fuzzy multiobjective hydropower system optimization model with creation of Reardon type fuzzy membership functions. The models are applied to a real-life hydropower reservoir system in Brazil. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are used to (i) solve the optimization formulations to avoid computational intractability and combinatorial problems associated with binary variables in unit commitment, (ii) efficiently address Reardon method formulations, and (iii) deal with local optimal solutions obtained from the use of traditional gradient-based solvers. Decision maker's preferences are incorporated within fuzzy mathematical programming formulations to obtain compromise operating rules for a multiobjective reservoir operation problem dominated by conflicting goals of energy production, water quality and conservation releases. Results provide insight into compromise operation rules obtained using the new Reardon fuzzy multiobjective optimization framework and confirm its applicability to a variety of multiobjective water resources problems.

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

DT Article
ID REMOTE-SENSING DATA; COVER MAPS; IMPACTS
AB The spatial and temporal variations of snowcover distribution, and snowmelt runoff are considered as sensitive indicators for climatic change. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and forecast the responses of snowmelt runoff to climate change in an inland river basin. The upper basin of Heihe River in Northwestern China was chose as the study area, and the observation data from the meteorological and hydrological stations were utilized to analyze the status and regularity of the climatic change over the past 50 years. Snow cover area was obtained by an optimized technology using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data with Normalized Difference Snow Index adjustment and topographic correction. A concept of potential snowmelt was suggested to illustrate the response of spatial snowmelt to climate change. The results show that the annual SCA proportion and the potential snowmelt keep an increasing trend since 2000. There is a negative relationship between annual air temperature and SCA proportion from 2000 to 2008. Snowmelt Runoff Model was chose to simulate snowmelt runoff and scenario forecast the change trend of snowmelt runoff in this region. The results show that climatic warming was apparent in the upper basin of Heihe River over the past 50 a. Annual average air temperature of three different weather stations located in the basin has increased 2.1 degrees C, 2.6 degrees C and 2.9 degrees C respectively from 1956 to present. The snowmelt runoff has increased obviously from 1970 to present. With different warming climate scenarios, the results by using SRM simulating showed that the first occurred time of snowmelt runoff shift ahead and discharge become larger as responses of snowmelt runoff to air temperature increasing, and the influence of temperature rising on average discharge of the whole snow season is not obvious.

AB Topological groundwater hydrodynamics is an emerging subdiscipline in the mechanics of fluids in porous media whose objective is to investigate the invariant geometric properties of subsurface flow and transport processes. In this paper, the topological characteristics of groundwater flows governed by the Darcy law are studied. It is demonstrated that: (i) the topological constraint of zero helicity density during flow is equivalent to the Darcy law; (ii) both steady and unsteady groundwater Rows through aquifers whose hydraulic conductivity is an arbitrary scalar function of position and time are confined to surfaces on which the streamlines of the flow are geodesic curves; (iii) the surfaces to which the flows are confined either are flat or are tori; and (iv) chaotic streamlines are not possible for these flows, implying that they are inherently poorly mixing in advective solute transport.

AB The storage function hydrograph model is one of the most commonly used models for flood runoff analysis in Japan, This paper studies the generality of the approach and its application to Japanese basins. Through a comparison of the basic equations for the models, the storage function model parameters, K, Pt and T-1, are shown to be related to the terms, k and p, in the kinematic wave model, This analysis showed that P and p are identical and K and T-1 can be related to k, the basin area and its land use.
   To apply the storage function model throughout Japan, regional parameter relationships for K and T-1 were developed for different land-use conditions using data from 22 watersheds and 91 flood events, These relationships combine the kinematic wave parameters with general topographic information using Hack's Law. The sensitivity of the parameters and their physical significance are also described. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID FOOTPRINTS
AB Through the international trade of food commodities, countries virtually export or import the water used for food production, known as virtual water. The international trade network thus implies a network of virtual water flows from exporting to importing countries. The purpose of this study is to identify some controlling factors of the virtual water network by means of multivariate regression analyses, or gravity laws, as often named in economics. Starting from the FAOSTAT database, we reconstruct 25 years (1986-2010) of international virtual water trade values; we then analyze the dependence of the exchanged fluxes on: population, gross domestic product, arable land, virtual water embedded in agricultural production and dietary demand, and geographical distance between countries. Significant drivers are identified for each country considering separately export and import fluxes; temporal trends are outlined and the relative importance of drivers is assessed by a commonality analysis. Results indicate that population, gross domestic product and geographical distance are the major drivers of virtual water fluxes, with a minor (nonnegligible) contribution given by the agricultural production of exporting countries. Such drivers have become relevant for an increasing number of countries throughout the years, with an increasing variance explained by the distance between countries and a decreasing role of the gross domestic product. The worldwide adjusted coefficient of determination of fitted gravity-law model is 0.57 (in 2010), and it has increased in time, confirming the good descriptive capability of selected drivers for the virtual water trade.

AB Interfaces between a water column and underlying porous media are ubiquitous in nature. Turbulent flow over an irregular interface separating a water column and underlying porous media drives advective- fluid exchange between the two domains. We investigate the dynamics of this coupled system for unidirectional flow in the water column and a triangular interface modeled on dunes. Numerical simulations solve the Reynolds- averaged Navier- Stokes equations for the water column and then Darcy's Law and the continuity equation for the porous media. The two sets of equations are coupled via the pressure distribution along the interface. The pressure maximum and minimum along the interface, which are tied to the presence of an eddy, dominantly control the configuration of and flux through the interfacial exchange zone ( IEZ) in the porous media. Since the length of eddies for fully developed turbulent flow is insensitive to the Reynolds numbers ( Re), the configuration of the IEZ remains stable across a range of Re, although flux through the IEZ is strongly dependent on the Re. The flux is a power function of Re and a linear function of the current- topography induced pressure gradient along the interface. Mean residence times for fluids in the IEZ follow an inverse- power relationship with Re since the volume of the IEZ is insensitive to Re. The IEZ depths and fluxes can be predicted via equations fitted to the simulated IEZ depths and fluxes, scaled by the dune steepness, for different Re, granted that other systems maintain close dynamic similitude with those studied here.

AB The classification of river forms and processes has emerged as a major site for interdisciplinary cooperation and application of environmental science. Geomorphologists, ecologists, planners, and others have made concerted efforts to develop theoretical and empirical frameworks with which to classify rivers and their component parts for multiple, diverse applications. As the breadth and depth of classification logics continue to swell, this article takes stock of recent developments through three analytical lenses. First, the theoretical underpinnings of river classification are explored and summarized to provide a framework within which to situate and compare different classification approaches. Second, four emerging frameworks for river classification are described and compared to assess their epistemological, institutional, and governance implications. Different epistemic communities produce different kinds of classifications, which reveal different 'realities' of rivers to be acted upon by human agents. Third, by emphasizing how river classification practices are productive of environmental governance regimes and rationalities, the roles, responsibilities, and possibilities for environmental science are clarified and expanded. Rather than thinking about classification purely as a realist scientific project, attention needs to be paid to the ways in which 'classifying mindsets' relate to the production of social and environmental outcomes.

AB Integrated water management, sustainable water management, water sensitive cities, and other formulations are often presented as the latest in a series of paradigms of water management. This implies a unified approach, while urban water debates reflect a wide diversity of political, social, and technical viewpoints. Five distinct but overlapping frameworks for urban water sustainability are evident in research, policy and practice, reflecting wider environmental theory, politics, and discourse. Sustainable development is based on meeting the needs for water and sanitation of the urban poor. Ecological modernization focuses on policies to improve water efficiency and treatment through technological innovation and individual behavior change. Socio-technical framings aim to understand how change in water systems occurs across physical and institutional scales and addresses the co-evolution of infrastructures, cultures, and everyday practices. Urban political ecology analyses water infrastructure in terms of relationships of power, pointing to the unequal distribution of costs and benefits of urban water management for the environment and citizens. Radical ecology addresses the relationship between human culture and non-human nature, proposing fundamental reorganization of society to solve ecological and hydrological crises. Characterizing alternate frameworks of urban water sustainability provides clarity on the underlying assumptions, methods, and politics across a diversity of approaches. Frameworks may be deployed strategically to deliver policy impact, or may reflect deeply held political or epistemological standpoints. Understanding different conceptions of urban water sustainability provides the basis for more constructive dialogue and debate about water and its role in sustainable cites.

AB A stochastic Bayesian approach for combining well logs and geophysical surveys for enhancing subsurface characterization is presented. The main challenge we face is in creating the bridge to link between ambiguously related geophysical surveys and well data. The second challenge is imposed by the disparity between the scale of the geophysical survey and the scale of the well logs. Our approach is intended to integrate and transform the well log data to a form where it can be updated by the geophysical survey, and this tends to be a convoluted process. Our approach starts with generating images of the lithology, conditional to well logs. Each lithology image is then used as the basis for generating a series of shaliness images, conditional to well log data. Shaliness images are converted to resistivity images using a site-specific petrophysical model relating between shaliness, resistivity, and lithology, to create the necessary interface with the cross-well resistivity survey. The lithology and resistivity images are then updated using cross-well electromagnetic resistivity surveys. We explored the limits of the approach through synthetic surveys of different resolutions and error levels, employing the relationships between the geophysical and hydrological attributes, which are weak, nonlinear, or both. The synthetic surveys closely mimic the conditions at the LLNL Superfund site. We show that the proposed stochastic Bayesian approach improves hydrogeological site characterization even when using low-resolution resistivity surveys.

AB [1] Considerable progress has been made in developing a theoretical framework for modeling slug test responses in formations with high hydraulic conductivity K. However, several questions of practical significance remain unresolved. Given the rapid and often oscillatory nature of test responses, the traditional hydrostatic relationship between the water level and the transducer-measured head in the water column may not be appropriate. A general dynamic interpretation is proposed that describes the relationship between water level response and transducer-measured head. This theory is utilized to develop a procedure for transforming model-generated water level responses to transducer readings. The magnitude of the difference between the actual water level position and the apparent position based on the transducer measurement is a function of the acceleration and velocity of the water column, test geometry, and depth of the transducer. The dynamic approach explains the entire slug test response, including the often-noted discrepancy between the actual initial water level displacement and that measured by a transducer in the water column. Failure to use this approach can lead to a significant underestimation of K when the transducer is a considerable distance below the static water level. Previous investigators have noted a dependence of test responses on the magnitude of the initial water level displacement and have developed various approximate methods for analyzing such data. These methods are re-examined and their limitations clarified. Practical field guidelines are proposed on the basis of findings of this work. The soundness of the dynamic approach is demonstrated through a comparison of K profiles from a series of multilevel slug tests with those from dipole-flow tests performed in the same wells.

AB This paper presents a method to establish the objective function of a network flow programming model for simulating river-reservoir system operations and associated water allocation, with an emphasis on situations when the links other than demand or storage have to be assigned with nonzero cost coefficients. The method preserves the priorities defined by rule curves of reservoir, operational preferences for conveying water, allocation of storage among multiple reservoirs, and transbasin water diversions. Path enumeration analysis transforms these water allocation rules into linear constraints that can be solved to determine link cost coefficients. An approach to prune the original system into a reduced network is proposed to establish the precise constraints of nonzero cost coefficients, which can then be efficiently solved. The cost coefficients for the water allocation in the Feitsui and Shihmen reservoirs' joint operating system of northern Taiwan was adequately assigned by the proposed method. This case study demonstrates how practitioners can correctly utilize network-flow-based models to allocate water supply throughout complex systems that are subject to strict operating rules.

AB This paper reviews simplified methods for evaluating the rainfall erosivity index and proposes two relationships for estimating the annual value of Wischmeier's rainfall erosivity index at sites equipped with recording and non-recording raingauges. For the Sicilian region, the FAO index was also found to represent the erosion risk. A regional relationship to estimate the standard deviation of the annual erosivity index is proposed. The isoerosivity map is plotted by using 41 values of the rainfall erosivity index calculated by Wischmeier's procedure and 128 values estimated according to a relationship proposed by the authors. Finally, for each of 169 sites, an erosion risk index is calculated and an erosion risk map is plotted.

AB Moving boat acoustic Doppler current profiling (ADCP) is increasingly used to measure discharge in large rivers. We investigate whether useful information about bed shear stress can be recovered from such data. Alternative ways to estimate local bed shear stress using the logarithmic law of the wall and spatial averaging are tested using ADCP transects across lower Fraser River, Canada. Repeatability is assessed by comparing estimates from outward and return boat tracks. The most precise method uses the vertically averaged mean velocity and a zero-velocity height based on bed grain size information. The accuracy of the assumed zero-velocity height can be judged by consistency between estimates using mean velocity and near-bed velocity. Shear stress estimates from unconstrained log-law fits are less repeatable and tend to overpredict, and mean shear stress estimates using the depth-slope product are unreliable in this river because of nonuniform flow.

AB Field and laboratory spectral induced polarization (SIP) measurements are integrated to characterize the hydrogeological conditions at the Schillerslage test site in Germany. The phase images are capable of monitoring thin peat layers within the sandy aquifers. However, the field results show limitations of decreasing resolution with depth. In comparison with the field inversion results, the SIP laboratory measurements show a certain shift in SIP response due to different compaction and sorting of the samples. The SIP data are analyzed to derive an empirical relationship for predicting the hydraulic conductivity (K). In particular, two significant but weak correlations between individual real resistivities (rho') and relaxation times (tau), based on a Debye decomposition (DD) model, with measured K are found for the upper groundwater aquifer. The maximum relaxation time (tau(max)) and logarithmically weighted average relaxation time (tau(lw)) show a better relation with K values than the median value tau(50). A combined power law relation between individual rho' and tau with K is developed with an expression of A . (rho')(B) . (tau(lw))(C), where A, B and C are determined using a least-squares fit between the measured and predicted K. The suggested approach with the calculated coefficients of the first aquifer is applied for the second. Results show good correlation with the measured K indicating that the derived relationship is superior to single phase angle models as Borner or Slater models.

AB Riparian resources include the borders of rivers, lakes, ponds, and potholes.  These border areas are very important for a number of reasons, including stream channel maintenance, flood control, aesthetics, erosion control, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and water quality maintenance.  These diverse functions are not well protected by law or policy.  We reviewed law and policies regarding endangered species habitat designation, land use planning, grazing management, water allocation, takings, and federal permits and licenses, along with the roles of federal, state, and local governments.  We discuss the politics of implementing these policies, focusing on the difficulties in changing entrenched water and land use practices.  Our review indicates a lack of direct attention to riparian ecosystem issues in almost all environmental and land use programs at every level of government.  Protection of riparian resource values requires a means to integrate existing programs to focus on riparian zones.

TI Demonstrating the "unit hydrograph" and flow routing processes involving
   active student participation - a university lecture experiment
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID MODELS
AB The unit hydrograph (UH) has been one of the most widely employed hydrological modelling techniques to predict rainfall-runoff behaviour of hydrological catchments, and is still used to this day. Its concept is based on the idea that a unit of effective precipitation per time unit (e.g. mmh 1) will always lead to a specific catchment response in runoff. Given its relevance, the UH is an important topic that is addressed in most (engineering) hydrology courses at all academic levels. While the principles of the UH seem to be simple and easy to understand, teaching experiences in the past suggest strong difficulties in students' perception of the UH theory and application.
   In order to facilitate a deeper understanding of the theory and application of the UH for students, we developed a simple and cheap lecture theatre experiment which involved active student participation. The seating of the students in the lecture theatre represented the "hydrological catchment" in its size and form. A set of plastic balls, prepared with a piece of magnetic strip to be tacked to any white/black board, each represented a unit amount of effective precipitation. The balls are evenly distributed over the lecture theatre and routed by some given rules down the catchment to the "catchment outlet", where the resulting hydrograph is monitored and illustrated at the black/white board.
   The experiment allowed an illustration of the underlying principles of the UH, including stationarity, linearity, and superposition of the generated runoff and subsequent routing. In addition, some variations of the experimental setup extended the UH concept to demonstrate the impact of eleva-tion, different runoff regimes, and non-uniform precipitation events on the resulting hydrograph.
   In summary, our own experience in the classroom, a first set of student exams, as well as student feedback and formal evaluation suggest that the integration of such an experiment deepened the learning experience by active participation. The experiment also initialized a more experienced based discussion of the theory and assumptions behind the UH.

Then a coefficient a of the sediment delivery relationship is related to several channel network parameters affecting the sediment transport efficiency. Finally, the spatial distribution of Cs-137 activity measured in a small Australian basin is used for validating the predictive capability of the proposed distributed approach to sediment delivery.

AB Available water resources are often not sufficient or too polluted to satisfy the needs of all water users. Therefore, allocating water to meet water demands with better quality is a major challenge in reservoir operation. In this paper, a methodology to develop operating strategies for water release from a reservoir with acceptable quality and quantity is presented. The proposed model includes a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization model linked with a reservoir water quality simulation model. The objective function of the optimization model is based on the Nash bargaining theory to maximize the reliability of supplying the downstream demands with acceptable quality, maintaining a high reservoir storage level, and preventing quality degradation of the reservoir. In order to reduce the run time of the GA-based optimization model, the main optimization model is divided into a stochastic and a deterministic optimization model for reservoir operation considering water quality issues.
   The operating policies resulted from the reservoir operation model with the water quantity objective are used to determine the released water ranges (permissible lower and upper bounds of release policies) during the planning horizon. Then, certain values of release and the optimal releases from each reservoir outlet are determined utilizing the optimization model with water quality objectives. The support vector machine (SVM) model is used to generate the operating rules for the selective withdrawal from the reservoir for real-time operation. The results show that the SVM model can be effectively used in determining water release from the reservoir. Finally, the copula function was used to estimate the joint probability of supplying the water demand with desirable quality as an evaluation index of the system reliability. The proposed method was applied to the Satarkhan reservoir in the north-western part of Iran. The results of the proposed models are compared with the alternative models. The results show that the proposed models could be used as effective tools in reservoir operation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   CUBIC LAW; VALIDITY
AB The knowledge of flow phenomena in fractured rocks is very important for groundwater resources management in hydrogeological engineering.
   A critical emerging issue for fractured aquifers is the validity of the Darcian-type "local cubic law", which assumes a linear relationship between flow rate and pressure gradient to accurately describe flow patterns.
   Experimental data obtained under controlled conditions such as in a laboratory increase our understanding of the fundamental physics of fracture flow and allow us to investigate the presence of non-linear flow inside fractures that generates a substantial deviation from Darcy's law.
   In this study the presence of non-linear flow in a fractured rock formation has been analyzed at bench scale in laboratory tests. The effects of non-linearity in flow have been investigated by analyzing hydraulic tests on an artificially created fractured rock sample of parallelepiped (0.60 x 0.40 x 0.8 m) shape.
   The volumes of water passing through different paths across the fractured sample for various hydraulic head differences have been measured, and the results of the experiments have been reported as specific flow rate vs. head gradient. The experimental results closely match the Forchheimer equation and describe a strong inertial regime. The results of the test have been interpreted by means of numerical simulations. For each pair of ports, several steady-state simulations have been carried out varying the hydraulic head difference between the inlet and outlet ports. The estimated linear and non-linear Forchheimer coefficients have been correlated to each other and respectively to the tortuosity of the flow paths. A correlation among the linear and non-linear Forchheimer coefficients is evident. Moreover, a tortuosity factor that influences flow dynamics has been determined.

AB This study proposes a method to reconstruct past spring flood discharge from continuous and discrete tree ring chronologies, since both have their respective strengths and weaknesses in northern environments. Ring width or density series provide uninterrupted records that are indirectly linked to regional discharge through a concomitant effect of climate on tree growth and streamflow. Conversely, discrete event chronologies constitute conspicuous records of past high water levels since they are constructed from trees that are directly damaged by the flood. However, the uncertainty of discrete series increases toward the past, and their relationships with spring discharge are often nonlinear. To take advantage of these two sources of information, we introduce a new transfer model technique on the basis of generalized additive model (GAM) theory. The incorporation of discrete predictors and the evaluation of the robustness of the nonlinear relationships are assessed using a jackknife procedure. We exemplify our approach in a reconstruction of May water supplies to the Caniapiscau hydroelectric reservoir in northern Quebec, Canada. We used earlywood density measurements as continuous variables and ice-scar dates around Lake Montausier in the James Bay area as a discrete variable. Strong calibration (0.57 < 0.61 < 0.75) and validation (0.27 < 0.44 < 0.58) R(2) statistics were obtained, thus highlighting the usefulness of the model. Our reconstruction suggests that, since similar to 1965, spring floods have become more intense and variable in comparison with the last 150 years. We argue that a similar procedure can be used in each case where discrete and continuous tree ring proxies are used together to reconstruct past spring floods.

ID RAINFALL-RUNOFF PROCESS; NEURAL-NETWORK; FLOW
AB This paper presents four different approaches for integrating conventional and AI-bascd forecasting models to provide a hybridized solution to the continuous river level and flood prediction problem. Individual forecasting models were developed on a stand alone basis using historical time series data from the River Ouse in northern England. These include a hybrid neural network, a simple rule-based fuzzy logic model, an ARMA model and naive predictions (which use the current value as the forecast). The individual models were then integrated via four different approaches: calculation of an average, a Bayesian approach, and two fuzzy logic models, the first bused purely on current and past river flow conditions and the second, a fuzzification of the crisp Bayesian method. Model performance was assessed using global statistics and a more specific flood related evaluation measure. The addition of fuzzy logic to the crisp Bayesian model yielded overall results that were superior to the other individual and integrated approaches.

AB Fracture traces and water fluxes have been determined along the 128 m long Roselend tunnel (French Alps). Fractures can be classified into two families: large fractures which intersect the tunnel and small fractures which partially intersect it. Three different zones in the tunnel are distinguished with mild, low, and high water fluxes, starting from the entrance. A stereological analysis of the trace length probability densities of small fractures provides the fracture diameter probability density distribution which is best approximated by a power law. Large fractures are assumed monodisperse, with a 5 m estimated radius. The generated fracture networks obtained by combining large and small fractures do percolate, while networks consisting of only small fractures do not percolate. Computed macroscopic permeabilities of the fracture networks are in agreement with the observed water fluxes when the fracture permeability is a power law of its lateral extent with an exponent equal to 3.

AB Unfortunately, the present paper has many scientific mistakes even in the basic conception and application of the fuzzy theory and genetic algorithm applications in addition to the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method approach. For instance, although in the abstract the authors state that "... combining the inverse distance method and fuzzy theory...", in fact one of their misconceptions is that they regard the weighting factors in the IDW interpolation method and the membership function in the fuzzy theory to be same but have expressed in different words. This statement indicates that the authors arrived at such a conclusion on the basis of geometrical similarity between the weighting factors and membership functions, which is not valid.

DE MULTISCALING; SIMPLE SCALING; REGIONAL FLOODS; RAINFALL; SNOWMELT;
   RUNOFF
AB The concepts of simple scaling and multiscaling provide a new theoretical framework for the study of spatial or regional flood frequency relations and their underlying physical generating mechanisms. In particular, the scaling exponents in the power law relationship between flood quantiles and drainage areas contain a 'basic signature of invariance' regarding the spatial variability of floods, and therefore suggest different hypotheses regarding their physical generating mechanisms. If regional floods obey simple scaling, then the slopes do not vary with return periods. On the other hand, if regional floods obey multiscaling, then the slopes vary with return periods in a systematic manner. This premise is expanded here by investigating the empirical variations in the scaling exponents in three states of the USA: New York, New Mexico and Utah. Distinct variations are observed in the exponents among several regions within each state. These variations provide clear empirical evidence for the presence of both simple scaling and multiscaling in regional floods. They suggest that snowmelt-generated floods exhibit simple scaling, whereas rainfall-generated floods exhibit multiscaling. Results from a simple rainfall-runoff experiment, along with the current research on the spatial scaling structure of mesoscale rainfall, are used to give additional support to these physical hypotheses underlying two different scaling structures observed in floods. In addition, the rainfall-runoff experiment suggests that the behaviour of the flood exponents in small basins is determined by basin response rather than precipitation input. This finding supports the existence of a critical drainage area, as has been reported for the Appalachia flood data in the USA, such that the spatial variability in floods in basins larger than the critical size is determined by the precipitation input, and in basins smaller than the critical size is determined by the basin response.

AB This review examines how stormwater is being rethought of as a resource in urban planning and governance. No longer administered simply as a conveyance problem, a range of actors are progressively repurposing stormwater as an underutilized resource that can resolve water quality and quantity challenges. I suggest this transition emerged out of the need to address a host of problems rooted in the institutional and infrastructural legacy of treating stormwater as a waste and flood control problem, as well as a new set of concerns associated with climate change, continued urbanization, and fiscal and administrative cuts. As a response, a number of technical and political mechanisms are looking to remake stormwater as a resource. In particular, the review focuses on the role of green infrastructure and technological change, legal structures, and incentives to enroll citizens into the governance process. These practices assemble stormwater as a resource by configuring diverse forms of knowledge, technology, and relations that meet political goals to build smart, resilient, and sustainable cities.

AB Our current understanding of wetlands is insufficient to assess the effects of past and future wetland loss. While knowledge of wetland hydrology is crucial, groundwater flows are often neglected or uncertain. In this paper, groundwater inflows were estimated in wetlands in southwestern Wisconsin using traditional Darcy's law calculations and three independent methods that included (1) stable isotope mass balances, (2) temperature profile modeling, and (3) numerical water balance modeling techniques. Inflows calculated using Darcy's law were lower than inflows estimated using the other approaches and ranged from 0.02 to 0.3 cm/d. Estimates obtained using the other methods generally were higher (0.1 to 1.1 cm/d) and showed similar spatial trends. An areal map of groundwater flux generated by the water balance model demonstrated that areas of both recharge and discharge exist in what is considered a regional discharge area. While each method has strengths and weaknesses, the use of more than one method can reduce uncertainty in the estimates.

ID MODEL
AB [1] Built components of watersheds are associated with impervious surfaces that alter hydrology, disrupt ecosystems, and affect water quality. This study focuses on the impervious factor as a tool for assessment and policy design to address water quality impacts. The empirical model uses a combination of watershed simulation and statistical regression modeling to study sediment loading at various stages of urbanization. The policy design is based on private behavior in a watershed setting to develop appropriate economic approaches. The incentives through taxes, subsidies, and cost sharing are based on water quality impacts. It was observed that nonlinearity in response functions resulted in transition effects that are continuous. This is due to gradual shifts in landscape characteristics as a result of urbanization. On a regional basis, impervious factor had a varying effect on water quality and depend on the state of urbanization and spatial characteristics. Economic policies based on a metric like impervious cover can be used to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization in watersheds through use of appropriate BMPs, urban forestry methods, and spatial targeting. While linear rules in policy are easier to implement, nonlinear rules were more effective in representing the changes in marginal social cost of impervious factor, especially initial and late stages of urbanization. There exists excellent scope in using this targeted policy to address specific problems associated with complex urban systems.

AB To assess global water availability and use at a subannual timescale, an integrated global water resources model was developed consisting of six modules: land surface hydrology, river routing, crop growth, reservoir operation, environmental flow requirement estimation, and anthropogenic water withdrawal. The model simulates both natural and anthropogenic water flow globally (excluding Antarctica) on a daily basis at a spatial resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees (longitude and latitude). This first part of the two-feature report describes the six modules and the input meteorological forcing. The input meteorological forcing was provided by the second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP2), an international land surface modeling project. Several reported shortcomings of the forcing component were improved. The land surface hydrology module was developed based on a bucket type model that simulates energy and water balance on land surfaces. The crop growth module is a relatively simple model based on concepts of heat unit theory, potential biomass, and a harvest index. In the reservoir operation module, 452 major reservoirs with >1 km(3) each of storage capacity store and release water according to their own rules of operation. Operating rules were determined for each reservoir by an algorithm that used currently available global data such as reservoir storage capacity, intended purposes, simulated inflow, and water demand in the lower reaches. The environmental flow requirement module was newly developed based on case studies from around the world. Simulated runoff was compared and validated with observation-based global runoff data sets and observed streamflow records at 32 major river gauging stations around the world. Mean annual runoff agreed well with earlier studies at global and continental scales, and in individual basins, the mean bias was less than +/- 20% in 14 of the 32 river basins and less than +/- 50% in 24 basins. The error in the peak was less than +/- 1 mo in 19 of the 27 basins and less than +/- 2 mo in 25 basins. The performance was similar to the best available precedent studies with closure of energy and water. The input meteorological forcing component and the integrated model provide a framework with which to assess global water resources, with the potential application to investigate the subannual variability in water resources.

ID MONITORING NETWORK DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION
AB Fundamental to the spatial sampling design of a groundwater quality monitoring network is the spatial structure of groundwater quality variables. The entropy theory presents all alternative approach to describe this variability. A case study is presented which used groundwater quality observations (13 years 1987-2000) from groundwater domestic wells in the Gaza Strip. Palestine. The analyses of the spatial structure used the following variables: Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg). Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Chloride (Cl). Nitrate (NO3), Sulphate (SO4), alkalinity and hardness. For all these variables the spatial structure is described by means of Transinformation as a function of distance between wells (Transinformation Model) and correlation also as a function of distance (Correlation Model). The parameters of the Transinformation Model analysed were (1) the initial value of the Transinformation: (2) the rate of information decay: (3) the minimum constant value: and (4) the distance at which the Transinformation Model reaches its value. Exponential decay curves were fitted to both models. The Transinformation Model was found to be superior to the Correlation Model in representing the spatial variability (structure). The parameters of the Transinformation Model were different for some variables and similar for others. That leads to a reduction of the variables to be monitored and consequently reduces the cost of monitoring.

TI Stochastic model of the width function
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID UNIT-HYDROGRAPH; RIVER NETWORKS; CATCHMENTS
AB A new class of probabilistic models of the width function, based on so-called iterated random pulse (IRP) processes, is proposed. IRP processes reproduce the main characteristics of empirical width functions (nonnegativity, nonstationarity, and power law decay of the spectrum) and require few and easily accessible parameters. IRP models are based on a simple conceptualization of the geometrical structure of river basins and exploit in a natural way the self-similarity of natural channel networks. A result that is derived from the IRP representation is that the exponent alpha of Hack's law, L similar to A(alpha), and the exponent beta of the power spectral density of the width function, S(omega) similar to \omega\(-beta), are related as alpha = 1/beta. Empirical values of beta are typically in the range 1.8-2.0 and are consistent with this theoretical result and the usual range of alpha.

AB A numerical model has been developed to simulate the biodegradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b bacteria as observed in a saturated, open system sand-bed experiment. The sand pack was inoculated with bacteria in a resting state (without nutrients) to form a 10 cm thick attached filter along the direction of flow. Degradation occurs through cometabolism of TCE to Cl- and primarily HCO3- as the major overall carbon product. A steady, 1.5 cm/h saturated flow was established in the sand pack, and was later doped (upstream of the attached filter) with a 13-day, 4 ppm pulse of TCE. Concentrations of TCE were monitored immediately upstream and downstream of the attached bacterial filter. Accounting for travel time through the test bed, observed downstream concentrations indicated degradation in the filter was complete for 0.5 days, substantially complete for another 1.5 days, and increasingly limited over the next 11 days, after which the outflow concentrations returned to zero, indicating the end of the pulse. Measurements of Cl- breakthrough were used to confirm TCE degradation quantitatively. The return of TCE in the downstream flow was anticipated from repetitive exposure, cyclic transfer experiments in sealed tubes which showed a limited capacity of the bacteria in the resting state to degrade TCE. Simulations based upon a previously-determine Michaelis-Menton relationship were used to successfully model the experimental results in the sand test-bed. Based upon the tube-transfer experiments, the rate law was adjusted to account for a fixed or limited capacity of the bacteria in the resting state to degrade TCE. The degradation capacity of sand-attached M. trichosporium OB3b has been estimated to be about 0.30 g TCE/g bacteria, and is not expected to be a leading limitation in implementing this approach for bioremediation in the held.

AB State-of-the-art evaporation models usually assume net radiation (R-n) and surface temperature (T-s; or near-surface air temperature) to be independent forcings on evaporation. However, R-n depends directly on T-s via outgoing longwave radiation, and this creates a physical coupling between R-n and T-s that extends to evaporation. In this study, we test a maximum evaporation theory originally developed for the global ocean over saturated land surfaces, which explicitly acknowledges the interactions between radiation, T-s and evaporation Similar to the ocean surface, we find that a maximum evaporation (LEmax) emerges over saturated land that represents a generic trade-off between a lower R-n and a higher evaporation fraction as T-s increases. Compared with flux site observations at the daily scale, we show that LEmax corresponds well to observed evaporation under non-water-limited conditions and that the T-s value at which LEmax occurs also corresponds with the observed T-s. Our results suggest that saturated land surfaces behave essentially the same as ocean surfaces at timescales longer than a day and further imply that the maximum evaporation concept is a natural attribute of saturated land surfaces, which can be the basis of a new approach to estimating evaporation.

AB In environmental applications it is often of interest to predict the rates at which contaminant mass is discharged at a given cross section of streams and rivers. We present a Lagrangian methodology for evaluating tracer discharge (mass per unit time) at specified control cross sections (CCS) of streams. The key transport processes included in the analysis are advection, degradation/decay, and kinetically controlled mass transfer in storage zones and in bed sediment. The transport in the bed sediment is described as a diffusion process, where the tracer may sorb onto the sediment. We have derived a general solution for tracer discharge in the Laplace domain wherefrom temporal moments are computed. The derived solutions may account for deterministic changes in morphological characteristics along stretches of streams. The results are illustrated for zeroth and first two moments where we show the combined effect of advection, degradation, physicochemical mass transfer, and morphology. For illustrative purposes, we assume morphology to change downstream following power laws suggested by Langbein [1947] and Leopold and Maddock [1953]. The moments depend nonlinearly on the downstream distance, following power laws that reflect the power laws for the hydraulic geometry. We define two main dimensionless parameters, namely, kinetic storage parameter alpha* and bed parameter M, that control the amount of tracer mass eventually discharged at any given CCS. For M approximate to greater than or equal to 0.3 the most dominant mechanism that controls the amount of ultimately discharged tracer mass is the exchange with the bed sediment. Once estimated from field data for stretches of specified streams, the dimensionless parameters can be used in the derived expressions for predictive purposes.

   model for subsurface flow
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

ID CATCHMENT SCALE; STORMFLOW; EQUATION; AREA
AB The objective of this work is to analyse the storage-flux hysteretic behaviour of a simplified model for subsurface flow processes. The subsurface flow dynamics is analysed by means of a model based on the kinematic wave assumptions and by using a width weighting/depth averaging scheme which allows to map the three-dimensional soil mantle into a one-dimensional profile. Continuity and a kinematic form of Darcy's law lead to a hillslope-storage kinematic wave equation for subsurface flow, solvable with the method of characteristics. Adopting a second order polynomial function to describe the bedrock slope and an exponential function to describe the variation of the width of the hillslope with hillslope distance, we derive general solutions to the hill slope-storage kinematic wave equations, applicable to a wide range of hillslopes. These solutions provide a physical basis for deriving two geometric parameters alpha and psi which define the hydrological similarity between hillslopes with respect to their characteristic response and hysteresis. The hysteresis eta, quantified by the area of the hysteretic dimensionless loop, has been therefore computed for a range of values of parameters alpha and psi. Slopes exhibit generally clockwise hysteretic loop in the flux-storage plot, with higher groundwater mean volume for given discharge on rising limb than at same discharge on falling limb. It has been found that hysteresis increases with decreasing alpha and psi, i.e. with increasing convergence (for the shape) and concavity (for the profile), and vice versa. For relatively large values of alpha and psi the hysteresis may take a complex pattern, with combination of clockwise to anticlockwise loop cycles. Application of the theory to three hillslopes in the Eastern Italian Alps provides an opportunity to examine how natural topographies are represented by the two hillslope hydrological similarity parameters.

AB In a recently introduced parameterization for the soil water retention curve (SWRC) with a sigmoid wet branch and a logarithmic dry branch, the matric potential at the junction point of the sigmoid and the logarithmic branch (hj) was a fitting parameter, while that at oven dryness (hd) was derived from the fitting parameters. The latter is undesirable, especially if reliable data in the dry range are limited. Therefore, an alternative is presented in which shape parameter alpha instead of hd is a derived parameter, and hd can be fitted or fixed. The resulting relationship between alpha and hj is such that it prevents correct fits for hj. Fortunately, an expression for hj is found that allows it to be replaced by alpha as a fitting parameter. The corresponding parameter space is well behaved and has fewer internal bounds defined by restraining relationships between parameters than the space for hj as a fitting parameter. The few available values of hj in the literature are in line with those according to the new expression. The reformulated SWRC is fitted to data of 21 soils by shuffled complex evolution. The paper gives the main features of an accompanying open source fitting code. The curves fit the data well, except for some clayey soils. A theoretical value of hd performs well for a wide range of soils. The new SWRC simplifies to an earlier junction model of the SWRC based on a well known power-law SWRC if alpha is very large.

AB Intensity/duration/frequency (IDF)-relationships of extreme precipitation are widely used for design of stormwater facilities. As the properties of extreme precipitation may be very different for different storm types and different seasons, IDF-relationships which permit decomposition into different components are established. The different components refer to different storm types or to different seasons, depending on the type of decomposition.
   The present study is based on the long raingauge record of 10-min precipitation depths at Uccle/Ukkel (Belgium) for the period 1967-1993. Storms of two different types (type a: airmass thunderstorms, and type b: cyclonic/frontal storms) are separated based on their distribution of peak-over-threshold intensity. This is done for each duration (aggregation-level) in the range 10 min-15 days, using a two-component exponential distribution. The exponential decay parameters and the mixing parameter for the two components are estimated as functions of the aggregation-level. Those functions show scaling properties for the parameters.
   Different mixtures of storms of types a and b are also estimated for summer and winter conditions. It brings new elements in our current understanding of what determines the IDF curves and their scaling properties. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB [1] The Delmarva Peninsula between the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean comprises an irregular sequence of almost horizontal sand and silt or clay layers [Shedlock et al., 1999; Bohlke and Denver, 1995] whose connectivity and detailed geometry are not well known. A mosaic of groundwater basins with areas generally less than 30 km(2) provide the water supply for the region. The concentration of dissolved nitrate has increased greatly since 1950 [Shedlock et al., 1999], and a series of test wells, drilled in the Locust Grove area for chemical analyses of the groundwater, provide useful data on water table levels at various locations. A new depth-integrated hydraulic model of the aquifer flow is developed to handle the complex and poorly known structure of the region. It requires as inputs (1) historical rainfall data, (2) the elevation profiles along potential discharge streambeds, and (3) the depth-integrated hydraulic conductivity, inferred from a few individual well water levels. The analysis predicts quantitatively and without arbitrary parameters, the distribution of groundwater heights above mean sea level and the patterns of total groundwater flow throughout the study region. Throughout the test area the predicted and measured groundwater levels generally agree to within 1 meter. The groundwater flow patterns show two distinctive types of domain with little intermingling, one type originating near the groundwater divide and discharging into the semipermanent streams and the other kind arising between the lower stream sections and discharging directly along the estuary shoreline. The measured distribution of water age with depth [Bohlke and Denver, 1995] agrees well with a simple formula provided by the theory.

AB Solute concentrations in stream water vary with discharge in patterns that record complex feedbacks between hydrologic and biogeochemical processes. In a comparison of three shale-underlain headwater catchments located in Pennsylvania, USA (the forested Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory), and Wales, UK (the peatland-dominated Upper Hafren and forest-dominated Upper Hore catchments in the Plynlimon forest), dissimilar concentration-discharge (C-Q) behaviors are best explained by contrasting landscape distributions of soil solution chemistry - especially dissolved organic carbon (DOC) - that have been established by patterns of vegetation and soil organic matter (SOM). Specifically, elements that are concentrated in organic-rich soils due to biotic cycling (Mn, Ca, K) or that form strong complexes with DOC (Fe, Al) are spatially heterogeneous in pore waters because organic matter is heterogeneously distributed across the catchments. These solutes exhibit non-chemostatic behavior in the streams, and solute concentrations either decrease (Shale Hills) or increase (Plynlimon) with increasing discharge. In contrast, solutes that are concentrated in soil minerals and form only weak complexes with DOC (Na, Mg, Si) are spatially homogeneous in pore waters across each catchment. These solutes are chemostatic in that their stream concentrations vary little with stream discharge, likely because these solutes are released quickly from exchange sites in the soils during rainfall events. Furthermore, concentration-discharge relationships of non-chemostatic solutes changed following tree harvest in the Upper Hore catchment in Plynlimon, while no changes were observed for chemostatic solutes, underscoring the role of vegetation in regulating the concentrations of certain elements in the stream. These results indicate that differences in the hydrologic connectivity of organic-rich soils to the stream drive differences in concentration behavior between catchments. As such, in catchments where SOM is dominantly in lowlands (e.g., Shale Hills), we infer that non-chemostatic elements associated with organic matter are released to the stream early during rainfall events, whereas in catchments where SOM is dominantly in uplands (e.g., Plynlimon), these non-chemostatic elements are released later during rainfall events. The distribution of SOM across the landscape is thus a key component for predictive models of solute transport in headwater catchments.

AB Legal principles and practices for determining ownership and control of seabed resources have been crafted and honed by various parties throughout the 20th century, often on an ad hoc basis to meet specific situations and sectoral needs. The legal landscape for offshore freshwater aquifers consequently spans domestic, regional, and international regimes, making the governance analysis for this untapped resource complex and multilayered. At the apex of ocean governance lies the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), a global treaty with almost universal application. Both LOSC and customary law grant each coastal state exclusive sovereign rights over seabed natural resources in its continental shelf, although those rights are limited by other legal commitments such as obligations to protect the environment. LOSC does not address transboundary resources, but early and sustained demand for offshore hydrocarbons caused that governance gap to be filled through judicial decisions, bi-lateral treaties, and customary practices. Traditionally, distribution of natural resources has been viewed as a right commensurate with sovereign claims to the resource, but a strong ethical argument can be made for treating water as an exceptional case due to its uniquely life-giving properties. When offshore freshwater is eventually appropriated for use, humanity will have an opportunity to choose between following old patterns of distribution or crafting a more inclusive system. In a world facing global shortages of freshwater due to pollution, overuse and climate change, policymakers designing a legal regime for untapped reservoirs of a vital resource for which there is no substitute should consider more equitable forms of distribution.

AB Governing equations for flow in three-dimensional heterogeneous and anisotropic porous media containing fractures or cracks with infinite transverse permeability are described. Fractures are modeled as zero thickness curve surfaces with the possibility of multiple intersections. It is assumed that flow obeys to an anisotropic Darcy's law in the porous matrix and to a Poiseuille type law in fractures. The mass exchange relations at fractures intersections are carefully investigated as to establish a complete mathematical formulation for the flow problem in a fractured porous body. A general potential solution, based on singular integral equations, is established for steady state flow in an infinite fractured body with uniform and isotropic matrix permeability. The main unknown variable in the equations is the pressure field on the crack surfaces, reducing thus from three to two the dimension of the numerical problem. A general transformation lemma is then given that allows extending the solution to matrices with anisotropic permeability. The results lead to a simple and efficient numerical method for modeling flow in three-dimensional fractured porous bodies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The emissivity of soil surfaces at microwave frequencies depends strongly on the near-surface water content. However this relationship varies between soils. Use is made of a model (MICRO-SWEAT) which couples water, heat and microwave radiation transfers through soils to show that the main cause of soil Variation in the relationship between apparent emissivity at 1.4 GHz (e(app)) and the average water content of the upper 2 cm of the profile (theta(0-2)) are differences in the dielectric properties. A simple semi-empirical model is proposed, based on the effect of soil particle size distribution on bound/free water partitioning, which provides a calibration between e(app) and theta(0-2). Although, in principle, the detailed shape of the water content distribution close to the surface will influence the e(app)/theta(0-2) relationship, such effects are only significant during short periods (<1 h) following the onset of rainfall which produces steep wetting fronts close to the soil surface.

AB A one-dimensional, fractional order, advection-dispersion equation accurately models the movement of the core of the tritium plume at the highly heterogeneous MADE site. An a priori estimate of the parameters in that equation, including the order of the fractional dispersion derivative, was based on the assumption that the observed power law (heavy) tail of the hydraulic conductivity (K) field would create a similarly distributed velocity field. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test this hypothesis. Results from the Monte Carlo analysis show that heavy tailed K fields do give rise to heavy tailed velocity fields; however, the exponent of the power law (the tail parameter) describing these two distributions is not necessarily the same. The tail parameter that characterizes a velocity distribution is not solely dependent on the tail parameter that characterizes the K distribution. The K field must also have long-range dependence so that water may flow through relatively continuous high-K channels.

AB This study focuses mainly on observing urban development in Taiwan's Wu-Tu watershed from the perspective of urban hydrological theory. An approach is proposed for developing a method for incorporating available meteorological data to define the degree of change in a runoff hydrograph for urbanizing basins. The mean rainfall was estimated using the Kriging method. For calibration, two methods of calculating the effective rainfall (the phi-index method and the non-linear-programming (NLP) method) were used as model inputs, and the optimal global parameters of the linear reservoir model were then obtained from the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm. Twenty-six (1966-1991) and eight (1994-1997) rainfall-runoff events were used for calibration and verification, respectively. The NLP method yielded better results than the phi-index method, especially for multipeak rainfall-runoff events. The regression equation determined the relationship between the parameters of the model and impervious areas. A comparison based on the results of the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the study area revealed that three decades of urbanization had increased the peak flow by 27%, and the time to peak was decreased by 4 h. The study simply describes the results of the impact of imperviousness on hydrological modelling. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Lattice Boltzmann flow simulations provide a physics-based means of estimating intrinsic permeability from pore structure and accounting for inertial flow that leads to departures from Darcy's law. Simulations were used to compute intrinsic permeability where standard measurement methods may fail and to provide better understanding of departures from Darcy's law under field conditions. Simulations also investigated resolution issues. Computed tomography (CT) images were acquired at 0.8 mm interscan spacing for seven samples characterized by centimeter-scale biogenic vuggy macroporosity from the extremely transmissive sole-source carbonate karst Biscayne aquifer in southeastern Florida. Samples were as large as 0.3 m in length; 7-9 cm-scale-length subsamples were used for lattice Boltzmann computations. Macroporosity of the subsamples was as high as 81%. Matrix porosity was ignored in the simulations. Non-Darcy behavior led to a twofold reduction in apparent hydraulic conductivity as an applied hydraulic gradient increased to levels observed at regional scale within the Biscayne aquifer; larger reductions are expected under higher gradients near wells and canals. Thus, inertial flows and departures from Darcy's law may occur under field conditions. Changes in apparent hydraulic conductivity with changes in head gradient computed with the lattice Boltzmann model closely fit the Darcy-Forchheimer equation allowing estimation of the Forchheimer parameter. CT-scan resolution appeared adequate to capture intrinsic permeability; however, departures from Darcy behavior were less detectable as resolution coarsened. Citation: Sukop, M. C., H. Huang, P. F.

AB In order to support the effort of Environment Canada directed to the automation of surface water quantity data management, an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS), to be used to create, develop and maintain stage-discharge (S-D) rating curves, is in the final stage of development. Environment Canada is the agency responsible for establishing gauging stations and monitoring streamflow in Canada. Hydraulic data such as stage and discharge are measured at these stations and used for the development of S-D rating curves. These in turn are cross-referenced with continuous water level recordings to generate daily stream discharges. The current procedure for establishing S-D curves used by Environment Canada is subjective, due to the manual labour involved in the plotting of measurements, analysing of data points and decision making to alter or update an existing curve. The IDSS computer system is based on the concept of representing rating curves with mathematical models or equations. The paper describes the main characteristics of the modelling module of the IDSS. Linear regression is the modelling technique used within the IDSS together with power and Box-Cox transformations introduced to achieve linearity of the data. Within the module presented in the paper, the generation of multiple S-D curves is combined with comprehensive statistical and multi-objective analyses in order to select an optimal mathematical model or equation.

AB This paper assesses the relationship between amount of climate forcing - as indexed by global mean temperature change - and hydrological response in a sample of UK catchments. It constructs climate scenarios representing different changes in global mean temperature from an ensemble of 21 climate models assessed in the IPCC AR4. The results show a considerable range in impact between the 21 climate models, with - for example - change in summer runoff at a 2 degrees C increase in global mean temperature varying between -40% and +20%. There is evidence of clustering in the results, particularly in projected changes in summer runoff and indicators of low flows, implying that the ensemble mean is not an appropriate generalised indicator of impact, and that the standard deviation of responses does not adequately characterise uncertainty. The uncertainty in hydrological impact is therefore best characterised by considering the shape of the distribution of responses across multiple climate scenarios. For some climate model patterns, and some catchments, there is also evidence that linear climate change forcings produce non-linear hydrological impacts. For most variables and catchments, the effects of climate change are apparent above the effects of natural multi-decadal variability with an increase in global mean temperature above 1 degrees C, but there are differences between catchments. Based on the scenarios represented in the ensemble, the effect of climate change in northern upland catchments will be seen soonest in indicators of high flows, but in southern catchments effects will be apparent soonest in measures of summer and low flows. The uncertainty in response between different climate model patterns is considerably greater than the range due to uncertainty in hydrological model parameterisation.

AB Soil water repellency is commonly assessed using the Water Droplet Penetration Time (WDPT) and Molarity of Ethanol (MED) or Critical Surface Tension (CST) tests. The former is a kinetic measurement indicating the persistence of water repellency; the latter, a thermodynamic measurement, gives the initial severity of water repellency. This study aims to provide a theoretical framework to understand (i) what determines differences in persistence and initial severity of soil water repellency and (ii) correlations between such data. A linear free energy relationship between Solution Droplet Penetration Time (SDPT) and the difference between the surface tension of the droplet solution, gamma(sol), and the Critical Surface Tension of the soil, gamma C-x, has been derived.
   ln(1/SDPT) = InA - [f (gamma(sol) - gamma C-x)/NkT]
   Here: gamma(sol) is the surface tension of water (for WDPT) or the solution being used (SDPT); N is the number of adsorbed molecules per unit area; k the Boltzmann constant; T the temperature; A is 1/SDPT when gamma C-x = gamma(sol); and f is an experimentally determined parameter. WDPT, SDPT (ethanol/water and propan-1-ol/water), and CST measurements for a group of sandy soils support this analysis. The value of f obtained (4-2 ( +/- 0-4)), suggests that the surface free energy contribution to the free energy of activation of wetting is given by the difference between the cohesive energy of the molecular film adsorbed on the soil grains and that of the wetting solution.
   In this interpretation: gamma c(x), is determined by the cohesive energy of the organic film adsorbed on the soil; WDPT is determined by the difference in cohesive energies between this adsorbed film and the droplet solution; and soil-to-soil variations in both WDPT and gamma c(x), are due to organic films of different cohesive energies present on the soil particles. For aqueous solutions of simple linear alcohols and ketones, SDPT depends on gamma(sol) but is independent of the compound used to control gamma(sol). Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The solution describing the wellbore flow rate in a constant-head test integrated with an optimization approach is commonly used to analyze observed wellbore flow-rate data for estimating the hydrogeological parameters of low-permeability aquifers. To our knowledge, the wellbore flow-rate solution for the constant-head test in a two-zone finite-extent confined aquifer has never been reported so far in the literature. This article is first to develop a mathematical model for describing the head distribution in the two-zone aquifer. The Laplace domain solutions for the head distributions and wellbore flow rate in a two-zone finite confined aquifer are derived using the Laplace transform, and their corresponding time domain solutions are then obtained using the Bromwich integral method and residue theorem. These new solutions are expressed in terms of an infinite series with Bessel functions and not straightforward to calculate numerically. A large-time solution for the wellbore flow rate is therefore developed by employing the relationship of small Laplace variable versus large time variable and L'Hospital's rule. The result shows that the large-time solution is identical to the steady-state solution obtained after applying the Tauberian theorem into the Laplace domain solution. This large-time solution can reduce to the Thiem equation in the case of no skin. Finally, the newly developed solution is used to investigate the effects of outer boundary distance and conductivity ratio on the wellbore flow rate. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Extension of the Representative Elementary Watershed approach for cold

AB The paper extends the Representative Elementary Watershed (REW) theory for cold regions through explicit treatment of energy balance equations to include associated processes and process descriptions. A new definition of REW is presented which subdivides the REW into six surface sub-regions and two subsurface sub-re ions. Vegetation. snow, soil ice, and glacier ice are included in the system so that such phenomena as evaporation/transpiration, melting, freezing, and thawing can be modeled in a physically reasonable way. The sub-stream-network is separated from other sub-regions so that the sub-REW-scale runoff routing function can be modeled explicitly. The final system of 24 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can meet the requirements of most hydrological modeling applications, and the formulation procedure is re-arranged so that further inclusion of sub-regions and substances could be done more easily. The number of unknowns is more than the number of equations, which leads to the indeterminate system. Complementary equations are provided based on geometric relationships and constitutive relationships that represent geomorphological and hydrological characteristics of a watershed. Reggiani et al. (1999, 2000 2001) and Lee et al. (2005b) have previously proposed sets of closure relationships for unknown mass and momentum exchange fluxes. Tian (2006) has applied Lee's procedures and formulas and Monte Carlo simulation method, and has come up with a determinate system based on the equations, though precluding energy balance ones, proposed in this paper. The additional geometric and constitutive relationships required to close the new set of balance equations will be pursued in a subsequent paper.

TI A SEMIANALYTICAL ANALYSIS OF COMPRESSIBLE ELECTROPHORETIC CAKE FORMATION
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; CONSOLIDATION
AB Leaks in geomembrane liners of waste landfills and liquid impoundments cause chemical contaminants to leak into the subsurface environment. A mathematical model is presented to simulate electrophoretic sealing of impoundment leaks. The model describes the formation of a compressible clay cake because of electrical and gravitational forces. The model includes mass balance equations for the solid-particles and liquid phase, modified Darcy's law in an electrical field, and Terzaghi's definition of effective stress. The formulation is presented in the Eulerian coordinates. The resulting second-order, nonlinear partial differential equation and the lower boundary condition are linearized to obtain an analytical solution for time-dependent settlement. After discretizing in time the analytical solution is applied to simulate compression of an accreting Sediment. In the; simulation of an accreting sediment, solid fluxes on either side of suspension/sediment interface are coupled using a no-jump condition. The velocity of a discrete particle in the suspension zone is assumed to be equal to the algebraic sum of electrophoretic and Stoke's settling velocities. An empirical relationship available in the literature is used to account for the effect of concentration on the velocity of solid particles in the suspension zone. The validity of the semianalytical approach is partially verified using an exact steady state solution for self-weight consolidation. The simulation results obtained for a set of material parameters are presented graphically. It is noted that the electrokinetic consolidation of sediment continues even after the completion of electrophoretic settling of all clay particles. An analysis reveals that the electrophoretic cake formation process is quite sensitive to voltage gradient and the coefficient of compressibility.

TI A worldwide comparison of regional flood estimation methods and climate
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
ID FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; QUANTILE ESTIMATORS; STATISTICS
AB A summary of the results of regional flood frequency analyses that have been carried out in many tropical and sub-tropical countries is presented. The results provide a set of flood estimation methods which should be of immediate usefulness in practical applications, bearing in mind the errors of generalization. By defining the representative values of the mean annual flood and of the flood frequency curves for each region, an attempt has been made to develop relationships between the methods and climatic characteristics. These show that adequate relationships can be obtained based solely on the median annual average rainfall and the median catchment area for the regions. In particular, the steepness of the regional flood frequency curve can be estimated reasonably well from these two parameters. The relationships confirm that, broadly speaking, for humid regions the ''average'' flood - the flood that occurs regularly every one or two years - is relatively large, but the flood frequency curve is not very steep; rare floods (occurring once in every 100 to 1000 years) are not very much larger than the average flood. Conversely, in arid regions, the average flood is small, but rare floods can be extremely large multiples of the average. These relationships provide a useful initial indication of the type of regional flood frequency estimation method likely to be found in tropical and sub-tropical regions throughout the world.

AB A simple, generalized saturated zone formulation is presented in this paper to relax the assumption of an exponential function originally made in TOPMODEL. This saturated zone model is based on the concept of a 'discharge : relative storage' (Q Delta S) function which is derived empirically, using recession curve analysis, and may be of arbitrary form. The generalized formulation is applied to the Seternbekken MINIFELT catchment in Norway, where detailed distributed water table data have been measured. These water table data are used to suggest an empirical, power law modification of the topographic a/tan beta index. Results for the simulation through time of discharges and water table depths at a few locations show that the generalized saturated zone formulation is as efficient a simulator of the observed data as a conventional TOPMODEL, but requires one parameter less to be calibrated. The simulation of detailed water table distributions is only approximate in both cases. The modified power law index shows only a small improvement but provides a basis for a discussion of possible sources of error in the TOPMODEL assumptions for this site.

AB Oregon's forested coastal watersheds support important cold-water fisheries of salmon and steelhead (Oncorhynchus spp.) as well as forestry-dependent local economies. Riparian timber harvest restrictions in Oregon and elsewhere are designed to protect stream habitat characteristics while enabling upland timber harvest. We present an assessment of riparian leave tree rule effectiveness at protecting streams from temperature increases in the Oregon Coast Range. We evaluated temperature responses to timber harvest at 33 privately owned and state forest sites with Oregon's water quality temperature antidegradation standard, the Protecting Cold Water (PCW) criterion. At each site we evaluated stream temperature patterns before and after harvest upstream, within, and downstream of harvest units. We developed a method for detecting stream temperature change between years that adhered as closely as possible to Oregon's water quality rule language. The procedure provided an exceedance history across sites that allowed us to quantify background and treatment (timber harvest) PCW exceedance rates. For streams adjacent to harvested areas on privately owned lands, preharvest to postharvest year comparisons exhibited a 40% probability of exceedance. Sites managed according to the more stringent state forest riparian standards did not exhibit exceedance rates that differed from preharvest, control, or downstream rates (5%). These results will inform policy discussion regarding the sufficiency of Oregon's forest practices regulation at protecting stream temperature. The analysis process itself may assist other states and countries in developing and evaluating their forest management and water quality antidegradation regulations.

AB A regionalisation methodology has been applied to catchments in England and Wales enabling estimation of daily flows for any catchment in the region for which physical data and records of rainfall and temperature are available. The rainfall-runoff model IHACRES has been calibrated to 60 catchments to obtain a set of dynamic response characteristics (DRCs) describing the hydrological behaviour within the region. physical catchment descriptors (PCDs) indexing topography, soil type, climate and land cover were collated and linked to the hydrological model by overlaying catchment boundaries with a geographical information system. Relationships were derived to describe the DRCs in terms of the PCDs so that the model may be used to simulate flow for any catchment in the region, given the driving variables, i.e. rainfall and temperature. In the England and Wales region, rainfall loss parameters have been defined in terms of land use, climate and soil type, whilst hydrograph separation parameters were characterised using topographical and soil variables. The set of DRC-PCD relationships, which were obtained by balancing the dual objectives of hydrological integrity and statistical significance, has been satisfactorily validated on two additional catchments within the region. Analysis of calibration errors was aided by sensitivity tests at one of these catchments in which flow response to variations in DRCs was assessed. Finally, a simple land use scenario demonstrates an application of the methodology in which variation in PCDs may be used to assess the impacts of environmental change. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; GROUNDWATER-FLOW; AQUIFER
AB Hydraulic conductivities of a portion of the Twin Lake aquifer are derived from grain size analyses performed at 3-cm vertical sampling intervals in four boreholes, spaced 1 m apart. Correlation of conductivity logs between four boreholes leads to a geometrical model which corresponds closely to the spatial structure derived from the velocity field of previous tracer tests. Histogram and correlogram analyses of conductivities agree closely with those of velocities, and the two data sets appear equally useful for characterizing the aquifer and its spatial variability. Using Darcy's law, flow velocities and conductivities are combined to calculate a theoretical, hydraulic gradient. Comparison to gradients observed at the site reveals agreement on a large scale. However, differences exist in detail because observed piezometric heads fail to reflect small-scale heterogeneity. Since these differences are significant for contaminant transport prediction, it is recommended for future studies to directly measure flow velocities from a tracer experiment, rather than to reply on head measurements and on Darcy's law for the calculation of transport parameters.

AB Landsliding in response to rainfall involves physical processes that operate on disparate timescales. Relationships between these timescales guide development of a mathematical model that uses reduced forms of Richards equation to evaluate effects of rainfall infiltration on landslide occurrence, timing, depth, and acceleration in diverse situations. The longest pertinent timescale is A/D-0, where D-0, is the maximum hydraulic diffusivity of the soil and A is the catchment area that potentially affects groundwater pressures at a prospective landslide slip surface location with areal coordinates x, y and depth H. Times greater than A/D-0 are necessary for establishment of steady background water pressures that develop at (x, y, H) in response to rainfall averaged over periods that commonly range from days to many decades. These steady groundwater pressures influence the propensity for landsliding at (x, y, H), but they do not trigger slope failure. Failure results from rainfall over a typically shorter timescale H-2/D-0 associated with transient pore pressure transmission during and following storms. Commonly, this timescale ranges from minutes to months. The shortest timescale affecting landslide responses to rainfall is root H/g, where g is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration. Postfailure landslide motion occurs on this timescale, which indicates that the thinnest landslides accelerate most quickly if all other factors are constant. Effects of hydrologic processes on landslide processes across these diverse timescales are encapsulated by a response function, R(t*) = root t*/pi exp (-1/t*) - erfc (1/root t*), which depends only on normalized time, t*. Use of R(t*) in conjunction with topographic data, rainfall intensity and duration information, an infinite-slope failure criterion, and Newton's second law predicts the timing, depth, and acceleration of rainfall-triggered landslides. Data from contrasting landslides that exhibit rapid, shallow motion and slow, deep-seated motion corroborate these predictions.

AB Transport of bacteria in a soil was delayed relative to the mobile pore water by rate-limited rather than instantaneous sorption to soil particles. Desorption rates were found to be faster than adsorption rates, and sorption kinetics were dependent on the density of bacteria and on the flow rate of water. Sorption kinetics were revealed by a combination of model descriptions of the mass balance and sorption kinetics of a groundwater bacterium entering a porous system and laboratory experiments using a stirred flow chamber and a soil column. The flow chamber was designed and operated to (1) distinguish instantaneous equilibrium reactions from time-dependent reactions, (2) estimate sorption rate: coefficients at different cell densities and water velocities, and (3) obtain rate coefficients that could be. used to predict the breakthrough of bacteria in a soil column under saturated, continuous flow conditions. Sorption rates in the stirred flow chamber were expressed by three rate laws, first order, Langmuir, and second order, and the transport of bacteria through the soil column was described and predicted by a model assuming a mixture of instantaneous and time-dependent sorption reactions and, alternatively, by a kinetic model. The sorption rate was primarily dependent on the density of sorbed bacteria, but the desorption rate was, in addition, influenced by the density of cells in the aqueous phase. Rate coefficients obtained in the flow chamber could be used to accurately predict transport of bacteria in the soil column at the corresponding density and flow rate, but extrapolations are complicated by the nonlinear relationship between density and sorption rate. Timescales for reaching equilibrium estimated from the rate coefficients were in the range from 10-15 hours to several days, longer for low densities and velocities.

TI Spatial scaling properties of annual streamflow in the United States

ID MESOSCALE RAINFALL; DISTRIBUTIONS; EXPONENTS
AB The spatial scaling properties of annual average streamflow is examined using records from 1 433 river basins across the continental United States. The log-linear relationship In(E[Q(i)(r)]) = a(r) + b(r)In(A(i)) is representative throughout the United States, where E[Q(i)(r)] represents the expectation of the rth moment of annual streamflow at site i, and A(i) represents drainage area. The scaling model parameters a(r) and b(r) follow nearly perfect linear relationships a(r) = r alpha and b(r) = r beta throughout the continental United States. We conclude that the probability distribution of annual streamflow follows simple scaling relationships in all regions of the United States. In temperate regions where climate is relatively homogeneous, scale alone describes most of the variability in the moments of annual streamflow. In the more climatically heterogeneous regions, such as in the Upper Colorado and Missouri river basins, scale alone is a poor predictor of the moments of annual flow.

DE BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY; SURFACE ENERGY FLUXES; HETEROGENOUS TERRAIN
AB This paper, part review and pare new work, falls into three main sections. The first is a review of scale issues in both hydrology and meteorology, focusing on their origins in the water and energy conservation equations, integrated over control volumes of different scales. Several guidelines for scale translations are identified.
   The second section reviews the upscaling problem in boundary-layer meteorology, setting out two 'flux-matching' criteria for upscaling models of land-air fluxes: the conservation requirement that surface fluxes average linearly and the practical requirement that model form be preserved between scales. By considering the effects of boundary conditions, it is shown that the combination or Penman-Monteith equation is a model for elemental energy fluxes which leads to physically consistent flux-matching rules for upscaling surface descriptors (resistances). These rules are tested, along with some other possibilities, and found to perform well.
   The third section tests the hypothesis that regionally averaged energy balances over land surfaces are insensitive to the scale of heterogeneity, X. Heterogeneity is classified as microscale when X less than or equal to UmT*, mesoscale when UmT*less than or equal to X less than or equal to UmTe, and macroscale when UmTe less than or equal to X [where U-m is the mean wind speed in the convective boundary layer (CBL) and T* and T-e the convective and entrainment time scales, respectively]. A CBL slab model is used to show that regionally averaged energy fluxes are remarkably insensitive to X in both the microscale and macroscale ranges. Other reviewed evidence suggests that the mesoscale range behaves similarly in dry conditions. Questions remain about the consequences of clouds and precipitation for regionally averaged surface energy fluxes.

AB This paper is concerned with the convergence of the Galerkin finite element method applied to a groundwater flow problem containing a borehole, with special reference to quadrature effects and the accuracy of the solution. It is shown that there exists an optimal quadrature rule for every choice of piecewise polynomial basis functions. Another interesting result proved here is that, in a direct application of the method the accuracy is very nearly independent of the degree of the polynomial basis functions, but strongly dependent on the distance of the borehole from the boundary if this is small.

TI THE CAUSE OF NEGATIVE INITIAL OUTFLOW WITH THE MUSKINGUM METHOD
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English

AB The cause of negative or reduced outflow formation at the beginning of a Muskingum solution is examined in two steps. The first step involves a physical interpretation bf the Muskingum weighted discharge and the storage equation, using theory based on an extension of the Kalinin-Milyukov method. The second step involves the derivation of an analytical solution for the weighted discharge based on linear systems analysis theory, and then subsequently the Muskingum solution from that analytical solution using the assumption of linear variation of discharge within the reach. It is proved that this assumption causes the formation of negative or reduced outflow at the beginning of a Muskingum solution.

TI STEAM STRIPPING OF CONTAMINATED UNSATURATED ZONE OF SUBSOILS -
   THEORETICAL-MODEL OF START-UP PHASE
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID LIQUID TRANSPORT; CLEANUP
AB The present paper addresses the unsteady process of steam stripping of the unsaturated zone of soils contaminated with volatile nonaqueous phase liquids. First, on the basis of Darcy's law and the conservation laws of mass and energy, a one-dimensional model is derived for the propagation of the steam front in the start-up phase. It is shown that this process is governed by one dimensionless group y. Subsequently, the evaporation mechanism behind, the transport to, and the condensation at the front of volatile contaminants are considered, taking the view that nonequilibrium exists between liquid and vapor phases. The model leads to a moving boundary problem which is of special mathematical interest. By a suitable transformation of the governing partial differential equations, the problem is brought into a fixed domain and solved numerically. For a broad range of the governing dimensionless numbers, computation results are presented. The results obtained in this paper make clear the role of the prevailing principal physical phenomena during the start-up phase of the process.

AB Some 27 years of passive microwave satellite observations have demonstrated the value of remote sensing for cryospheric applications, albeit at regional to hemispheric scales due to the relatively large sensor footprints (e.g. similar to 25 km x 25 km for the advanced microwave scanning radiometer). At the other extreme there is the primarily local-scale in situ experience of the snow community. Until higher-resolution sensors become available, understanding the effects of sub-pixel heterogeneity and the downscaling of observations remains an important topic.
   In order to provide a baseline for performing scaling studies and for future radiance-based hydrological assimilation schemes, an evaluation of snowpack forward radiance modelling at the plot scale (least heterogeneous scale) is carfied out. Snow microwave radiance models based on dense medium radiative transfer (DMRT) theory incorporate a high degree of physical fidelity, yet dense medium models are particularly sensitive to snowpack structural parameters such as grain size, density, and depth (parameters that may vary substantially within a snowpack). The DMRT performance is evaluated through the use of a fitting technique with respect to snow grain size, a hydrologically important parameter related to the total amount of melt water stored in a snowpack, snowpack metamorphism, vertical energy transport and melt dynamics, as well as various quantities useful in surface energy balance studies. All remaining snow input parameters to the model are derived from snow pit measurements. Model-predicted radiances are evaluated using microwave brightness measurements collected during the NASA Cold Land Process Experiment (CLPX) by the University of Tokyo's Ground-Based Microwave Radiometer-7 (GBMR-7) system at 18.7, 36.5, and 89 GHz, with incidence angles ranging from 30 to 70 degrees. The detailed CLPX microwave and snow data provide an excellent opportunity to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Diffusive exchange of solutes between intragranular pores and flowing water is a recognized but poorly understood contributor to dispersion. Intragranular porosity may also contribute to the "slow sorption" phenomenon. Intragranular pores may be sparsely interconnected, raising the possibility that accessible porosity and diffusive exchange are limited by pore connectivity. We used a pore-scale network model to examine pore connectivity effects on accessible porosity, tortuosity, and diffusivity in spherical particles. The diffusive process simulated was release of a nonsorbing solute initially at equilibrium with the surrounding solution. High-connectivity results were essentially identical to Crank's analytical solution. Low-connectivity results were consistent with observations reported in the literature, with solute released at early times more quickly than indicated by the analytical solution, and more slowly at late times. Values of accessible porosity, tortuosity, and diffusivity scaled with connection probability, distance to the sphere's exterior, and/or the sphere's radius, as predicted by percolation theory. When integrated into a conventional finite difference model, the scaling relationships provide a consistent and physically sound way to incorporate such nonuniformities into models of intragranular diffusion.

AB Instantaneous quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) and quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) by utilizing the meteorological radar data are potentially of great benefit for operational hydrology in river basins. The most commonly used technique of radar-based rainfall estimation is a best fitted power-law function between reflectivity (Z) and rain intensity (R). An emerging tool. in QPE/QPF using radar data is the artificial neural network (ANN) that is capable of learning complex nonlinear relationships. In this study, we introduce a dynamic ANN approach to construct instantaneous QPE and one-hour-ahead QPF by using a three-dimensional radar data structure, which takes into account the terminal velocity and the horizontal advection. Radar measurements and three rain gauges for six typhoon events in the Keelung River, Taiwan, were used for calibrating and evaluating the Z-R relation and dynamic ANN models. The results of current rainfall. estimation and one-hour-ahead rainfall forecasting all indicate that the dynamic ANN can produce much more accurate and stable performance than the Z-R power-law models. This study demonstrates that the dynamic ANN can be applied successfully in instantaneous QPE and QPF by using remote sensing data. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As watershed models become increasingly sophisticated and useful, there is a need to extend their applicability to locations where they cannot be calibrated or validated. A new methodology for the regionalization of a watershed model is introduced and evaluated. The approach involves calibration of a watershed model to many sites in a region, concurrently. Previous research that has sought to relate the parameters of monthly water balance models to physical drainage basin characteristics in a region has met with limited success. Previous studies have taken the two-step approach: (a) estimation of watershed model parameters at each site, followed by (b) attempts to relate model parameters to drainage basin characteristics. Instead of treating these two steps as independent, birth steps are implemented concurrently. All watershed models in a region are calibrated simultaneously, with the dual objective of reproducing the behaviour of observed monthly streamflows and, additionally, to obtain good relationships between watershed model parameters and basin characteristics. The approach is evaluated using 33 basins in the southeastern region of the United States by comparing simulations using the regional models for three catchments which were not used to develop the regional regression equations. Although the regional calibration approach led to nearly perfect regional relationships between watershed model parameters and basin characteristics, these "improved" regional relationships did not result in improvements in the ability to model streamflow at ungauged sites. This experiment reveals that improvements in regional relationships between watershed model parameters and basin characteristics will not necessarily lead to improvements in the ability to calibrate a watershed model at an ungauged site.

AB Runoff generation in natural catchments due to storm rainfall is highly complex and spatially and temporally heterogeneous. In recent work on seven small experimental catchments Larsen et al. (1994) showed that underlying the heterogeneity of runoff generation within the catchments, there is a degree of regularity between the catchments that could be quantified in terms of two dimensionless similarity parameters K-0* and f*. These two parameters, constants for a catchment, were able to characterize the relative dominance of the saturation excess (Dunne-type) and infiltration excess (Horton-type) mechanisms of runoff generation. Given that K-0* and f* can characterize the type of runoff generation on any catchment, it may follow that they can be used to define a catchment-scale runoff generation model. This idea is pursued in this paper. For the same catchments as studied by Larsen et al. (1994), a lumped, physically based model is developed that describes both the extent of saturated areas and the average infiltration capacity of the unsaturated areas during a storm. This is achieved by utilizing the distributed model used by Larsen et al. (1994) to aggregate the point-scale runoff generation responses, up to the catchment scale, from which the functional form and the parameters of the catchment-scale runoff generation model are inferred. The parameters of this lumped model are defined entirely in terms of the underlying distribution of topography, three similarity parameters K-0*,f* and B*, the normalized average water-table depth, z*, and the normalized cumulative volume of infiltration, G*.

AB This article shows some important scaling aspects that exist in hydrological process grid modelling with GIS, with respect to selecting the optimal grid width. Hydrologically relevant space parameter fields should often be regarded as selfsimilar fractals for which certain invariance characteristics are applied. These characteristics are especially important if there is an extensive change in the model grid width. The self-similarity generates simple scaling laws, which can be used for rescaling procedures.

TI Using a stochastic model for generating hourly hyetographs to study
   extreme rainfalls
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
ID STORM
AB A stochastic model for generating hourly hyetographs has been developed using data from observed precipitation records to simulate rainfall patterns. This model makes it possible to study maximum precipitation distributions for normal or exceptional frequencies over long periods of time. The modelling provides observations (up to 10-year frequency) of quantiles similar to those observed by directly fitting a law of statistical distribution onto an observed distribution. Differences occur for rare frequency quantiles. Modelled rainfall frequency distributions behave in an over-exponential way (i.e. greater than strictly exponential) at infinity, yielding higher results than those obtained using standard fittings. One factor that is considered in modelling can explain this behaviour: the persistence of storms within a rainfall episode which causes high rainfall accumulation. Thus modelling the observed phenomenon provides an innovative approach in studying extreme occurrences.

ID GUMBEL MIXED-MODEL; COPULAS; DISTRIBUTIONS
AB In the bivariate analysis of hydrological events, such as rainfall storms or flood hydrographs, the choice of an appropriate return period for structure design leads to infinite combinations of values of the related random variables (e. g. peak and volume in the analysis of floods). These combinations are generally not equivalent, from a practical point of view. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to identify a subset of the critical combinations set that includes a fixed and arbitrarily chosen percentage in probability of the events, on the basis of their probability of occurrence. Therefore, several combinations can be selected within the subset, taking into account the specific characteristic of the design problem, in order to evaluate the effects of different hydrological loads on a structure. The proposed method is applicable to any type of bivariate distribution, thus providing a simple but effective rule to narrow down the infinite possible choices for the hydrological design variables. In order to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be easily used in practice, it is applied to a study case in the context of bivariate flood frequency analysis.

ID FLOOD FREQUENCY ESTIMATION; CONTINUOUS SIMULATION; CATCHMENTS; TOPMODEL
AB Stores are widely used tools in conceptual soil-moisture accounting rainfall-runoff models. Various mathematical laws are used to describe the outflow of such stores. The exponential store has received less attention than the linear store, but it has proved to be a highly efficient tool in streamflow modelling. The aim of this study is to show that the common way of dealing with this store-without integration in time-is mathematically and physically flawed. This misuse can result in poorer reliability and efficiency of rainfall-runoff models that include such a store. Surprisingly, this inconsistency had a significant impact on only a limited number of catchments among the 138 used to carry out the tests. However, it can have dramatic consequences for the simulation of large flood events. Therefore, an exact discrete formulation should be preferred in rainfall-runoff models.

AB A general algorithm developed for stochastic optimization of multireservoir systems is used to determine optimal operational policies for five of the major reservoirs of the Parambikulam-Aliyar irrigation and power project in India. A closed-loop suboptimal policy was determined for the stochastic inflow, deterministic demand problem, subject to storage and cumulative release constraints imposed by an interstate water-sharing agreement. The closed-loop policies were further used to determine optimal rule curves for the major reservoirs. A comparison of the simulated optimal policies and the past performance of the project demonstrates the utility of the derived policies determined with the proposed algorithm.

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The "Integrated Water Resources Management" principle was formally laid down at the International Conference on Water and Sustainable development in Dublin 1992. One of the main results of this conference is that improving Water and Sanitation Services (WSS), being a complex and interdisciplinary issue, passes through collaboration and coordination of different sectors (environment, health, economic activities, governance, and international cooperation). These sectors influence or are influenced by the access to WSS. The understanding of these interrelations appears as crucial for decision makers in the water sector. In this framework, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) has developed a new database (WatSan4Dev database) containing 42 indicators (called variables in this paper) from environmental, socio-economic, governance and financial aid flows data in developing countries. This paper describes the development of the WatSan4Dev dataset, the statistical processes needed to improve the data quality, and finally, the analysis to verify the database coherence is presented. Based on 25 relevant variables, the relationships between variables are described and organised into five factors (HDP - Human Development against Poverty, AP - Human Activity Pressure on water resources, WR - Water Resources, ODA - Official Development Aid, CEC - Country Environmental Concern). Linear regression methods are used to identify key variables having influence on water supply and sanitation. First analysis indicates that the informal urbanisation development is an important factor negatively influencing the percentage of the population having access to WSS. Health, and in particular children's health, benefits from the improvement of WSS. Irrigation is also enhancing Water Supply service thanks to multi-purpose infrastructure. Five country profiles are also created to deeper understand and synthetize the amount of information gathered. This new classification of countries is useful in identifying countries with a less advanced position and weaknesses to be tackled. The relevance of indicators gathered to represent environmental and water resources state is questioned in the discussion section. The paper concludes with the necessity to increase the reliability of current indicators and calls for further research on specific indicators, in particular on water quality at national scale, in order to better include environmental state in analysis to WSS.

AB The use of similarity solutions for the problem of horizontal infiltration of water into a semi-infinite, dry and homogeneous porous medium is studied based upon some recent results of functional analysis. It is found that the so-called non-unique representation of reported experimental moisture profiles for this problem is not necessarily evidence against the validity of the extended Darcy's law for unsaturated flow through porous media.

TI Accurate calculation of specific discharge in heterogeneous porous media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English

ID VELOCITY
AB porous media result in inaccuracy in simulating the local specific discharge field at and in the vicinity of an interface between subdomains of different material properties. The domain decomposition method used in multilayered systems and a consistent scheme in a randomly heterogeneous domain are applicable only to some particular cases, such as when the material interfaces are parallel to an axis. Along a material interface, the law of refraction of streamlines, related to both the tangential and the normal specific discharge components, should be satisfied. By incorporating these interface conditions into the weak formulation of Darcy's law, two consistent numerical schemes have been developed. These schemes can be applied to accurately and efficiently simulate the specific discharge field in a heterogeneous domain with different values of the ratio of hydraulic conductivities between adjacent elements. In particular, they provide an easy way for treating aquifers with semipervious layers as a single system. Numerical simulations have been used to demonstrate the capability and accuracy of the proposed schemes. Comparison between the specific discharge fields computed by the proposed schemes and by other techniques shows that the new schemes are superior to the traditional ones.

AB Insight into spatial patterns of groundwater discharge through evapotranspiration is critical for understanding responses of groundwater dependent ecosystems. In the semi-arid floodplain environment of the lower River Murray, South Australia, patterns of steady state groundwater flux may indicate potential areas of anthropogenic salinisation due to adjacent irrigation and aid in management decisions for the protection of indigenous floodplain vegetation. This paper outlines the use of relationships for evapotranspiration response to groundwater depth and salt concentration, within the MODFLOW 2000 framework, to model spatial patterns of groundwater flux. This modelling approach is used to develop relationships between the steady state net rates evapotranspiration, seepage and baseflow, and floodplain properties including elevation, geometry, soil and vegetation distribution relevant to the field site. The model was applied to a key research site on the River Murray, South Australia, to facilitate understanding of the factors contributing to the development of spatial patterns of irrigation induced groundwater discharge. The inclusion of elevation and vegetation data in the methodology revealed the effects of microtopography and plant water use on groundwater discharge. Spatial distribution of vegetation had the highest correlation with patterns of groundwater evapotranspiration. Floodplain elevation, floodplain width and geometry, which related to vegetation cover, also affected both groundwater discharge and baseflow to the river. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Geomorphic systems are typically nonlinear, owing largely to their threshold-dominated nature (but due to other factors as well). Nonlinear geomorphic systems may exhibit complex behaviors not possible in linear systems, including dynamical instability and deterministic chaos. The latter are common in geomorphology, indicating that small, short-lived changes may produce disproportionately large and long-lived results; that evidence of geomorphic change may not reflect proportionally large external forcings; and that geomorphic systems may have multiple potential response trajectories or modes of adjustment to change. Instability and chaos do not preclude predictability, but do modify the context of predictability. The presence of chaotic dynamics inhibits or excludes some forms of predictability and prediction techniques, but does not preclude, and enables, others. These dynamics also make spatial and historical contingency inevitable: geography and history matter. Geomorphic systems are thus governed by a combination of "global" laws, generalizations and relationships that are largely (if not wholly) independent of time and place, and "local" place and/or time-contingent factors. The more factors incorporated in the representation of any geomorphic system, the more singular the results or description are. Generalization is enhanced by reducing rather than increasing the number of factors considered. Prediction of geomorphic responses calls for a recursive approach whereby global laws and local contingencies are used to constrain each other. More specifically a methodology whereby local details are embedded within simple but more highly general phenomenological models is advocated. As landscapes and landforms change in response to climate and other forcings, it cannot be assumed that geomorphic systems progress along any particular pathway. Geomorphic systems are evolutionary in the sense of being path dependent, and historically and geographically contingent. Assessing and predicting geomorphic responses obliges us to engage these contingencies, which often arise from nonlinear complexities. We are obliged, then, to practice evolutionary geomorphology: an approach to the study of surface processes and landforms which recognizes multiple possible historical pathways rather than an inexorable progression toward some equilbribrium state or along a cyclic pattern.

ID FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS
AB Israel is a small country which experiences wide variations in magnitudes of extreme discharges. A consistent model has been constructed for prediction of such discharges throughout the country. Extreme flow characteristics, geographical proximity, lithology, soils, and rainfall properties are the major factors in the delineation of relatively homogeneous regions within the country. For each region, discharge-area relationships are formulated in association with low exceedance probabilities. These relationships follow at-site predictions which have been prepared by fitting the log Pearson type III distribution to annual maxima series of peak discharges. For catchments larger than 100 km(2) in area, the differences between the regional and the at-site predictions are small. Relatively high extreme discharges are found for the arid area where rainfall depth is low, for an area of steep slopes, for areas of low permeable lithology and soils, and for areas where the fraction of intense rainfall in the total depth of precipitation is high. For large arid catchments, the discharge- area relationships exhibit a negative trend. The model is simply applicable and appears suitable for other semiarid and arid areas.

ID STORAGE; MODELS
AB Approximate storage-reliability-resilience-yield (S-R-R-Y) relationships are derived for over-year water supply systems fed by autoregressive lag one Gamma and normal inflows. It is shown that a two-state Markov model may be exploited along with S-R-R-Y relationships to describe the general behaviour of over-year water supply systems. The two-state Markov model is also used to relate the probability of n-year no-failure operations (the concept of reliability used in the USA) to the steady-state probability of a system failure (the concept of reliability used in Australia and elsewhere) yielding a unified view of system reliability. Resiliency criteria are introduced which indicate whether or not a reservoir system is likely to return to normal operations once a failure has set in. These criteria indicate that the resilience of an over-year water supply system is generally independent of its steady-state reliability. The conditions under which finite reservoir systems behave like semi-infinite reservoir systems are also documented, and a factor is derived which describes the impact of the serial correlation of the inflows on the derived S-R-R-Y relationship.

AB We consider the effect of measuring randomly varying hydraulic conductivities K(x) on one's ability to predict numerically, without resorting to either Monte Carlo simulation or upscaling, steady state: flow in bounded domains driven by random source and boundary terms. Our aim is to allow optimum unbiased prediction of hydraulic heads h (x) and fluxes q(x) by means of their ensemble moments, [h(x)](c) and [q(x)](c), respectively, conditioned on measurements of K(x). These predictors have been shown by Neuman and Ow [1993a] to satisfy exactly an integrodifferential conditional mean flow equation in which [q(x)](c) is nonlocal and non-Darcian. Here we develop complementary integrodifferential equations for second conditional moments of head and flux which serve as measures of predictive uncertainty; obtain recursive closure approximations for both the first and second conditional moment equations through expansion in powers of a small parameter sigma(Y) which represents the standard estimation error of in K(x); and show how to solve these equations to first order in sigma(Y)(2) dimensions. In the special case where one treats K(x) as if it was locally homogeneous and mean flow as if it was locally uniform, one obtains a localized Darcian approximation [q(x)](c) approximate to -K-c(x)del[h(x)](c) in which K-c(x) is a space-dependent conditional hydraulic conductivity tensor. This leads to the traditional deterministic, Darcian steady state flow equation which, however, acquires a nontraditional meaning in that its parameters and state variables are data dependent and therefore inherently nonunique. It further explains why parameter estimates obtained by traditional inverse methods tend to vary as one modifies the database. Localized equations yield no information about predictive uncertainty. Our stochastic derivation of these otherwise standard deterministic flow equations makes clear that uncertainty measures associated with estimates of head and flux, obtained by traditional inverse methods, are generally smaller (often considerably so) than measures of corresponding predictive uncertainty, which can be assessed only by means of stochastic models such as ours. We present a detailed comparison between finite element solutions of nonlocal and localized moment equations and Monte Carlo simulations under superimposed mean-uniform and convergent flow regimes in two dimensions. Paper 1 presents the theory and computational approach, and paper 2 [Guadagnini and Neuman, this issue] describes unconditional and conditional computational results.

AB The effects of landscape changes on winter and spring snow-related processes, and on regional weather and climate are not thoroughly understood. In this study, a climate version of the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (ClimRAMS) is used to investigate the effects of landscape change on seasonal snow depletion and its corresponding effects on atmospheric and hydrologic processes. Two simulations of the 1996 spring melt season in the Rocky Mountains and Northern Great Plains are compared. The first simulation utilizes the present-day vegetation distribution, and the second uses the same vegetation distribution with the exception that all forested regions are replaced by grassland. This vegetation modification affects 18% of the domain and changes the leaf area index, transmissivity of the vegetation canopy to incoming solar radiation, roughness length, and surface albedo. Additional snow-related differences occur because the snow lying over grass, and the snow under the forest canopy, exist in dramatically different radiative and thermal regimes. The snowcover changes resulting from the simulated deforestation influence the surface radiation balance, which leads to changes in surface sensible and latent energy fluxes, evaporation and transpiration rates, melt rates, and air temperature. The vegetation change also modifies snowcover depletion rates, which in turn cause variations in runoff production. Unmodified regions are affected through hydrologic transport processes. The manifestations of these changes with respect to regional weather and climate are discussed. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this study, a probabilistic collocation method (PCM) on sparse grids is used to solve stochastic equations describing flow and transport in three-dimensional, saturated, randomly heterogeneous porous media. The Karhunen-Loeve decomposition is used to represent log hydraulic conductivity Y = In K(s). The hydraulic head h and average pore-velocity v are obtained by solving the continuity equation coupled with Darcy's law with random hydraulic conductivity field. The concentration is computed by solving a stochastic advection-dispersion equation with stochastic average pore-velocity v computed from Darcy's law. The PCM approach is an extension of the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) that couples gPC with probabilistic collocation. By using sparse grid points in sample space rather than standard grids based on full tensor products, the PCM approach becomes much more efficient when applied to random processes with a large number of random dimensions. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have also been conducted to verify accuracy of the PCM approach and to demonstrate that the PCM approach is computationally more efficient than MC simulations.

AB A methodology of time-step estimation for numerically solving the Richards equation is discussed. Its importance in simulating water movement in unsaturated-saturated soils is shown for infiltration into a soil profile by applying various time-step estimations and boundary conditions for different soils. In order to test the results of the computations, infiltration theory was applied. According to infiltration theory, the pressure head in the initially unsaturated part will not take positive values as long as the moisture front has not reached the phreatic level, or, in the case of a profile with a free-draining lower boundary, it is not saturated at the base. In other cases, the appearance of positive values of the pressure head produces incorrect values for the inflow rate q.

AB In the past 2 decades a new modern scaling technique has emerged from the highly developed theory on the Lie group of transformations. This new method has been applied by engineers to several problems in hydrology and hydraulics, including but not limited to overland flow, groundwater dynamics, sediment transport, and open channel hydraulics. This study attempts to clarify the relationship this new technology has with the classical scaling method based on dimensional analysis, non-dimensionalization, and the Vaschy-Buckingham-I theorem. Key points of the Lie group theory, and the application of the Lie scaling transformation, are outlined and a comparison is made with two classical scaling models through two examples: unconfined groundwater flow and contaminant transport. The Lie scaling method produces an invariant scaling transformation of the prototype variables, which ensures the dynamics between the model and prototype systems will be preserved. Lie scaling can also be used to determine the conditions under which a complete model is dynamically, kinematically, and geometrically similar to the prototype phenomenon. Similarities between the Lie and classical scaling methods are explained, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the techniques are discussed.

AB The coherence or synchrony in the trends in SO42- concentration in a set of 100 lakes in Norway that have a long-term chemical record was evaluated. Using a statistical technique that compares patterns or trends that are not uni-directional, the lakes were grouped into 18 subsets or clusters, each with between 2 and 11 lakes that had similar trends. These temporal trends were strongly correlated with several climate indices, notably the Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI) measured in the autumn. and the annual North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI). Because these clusters of lakes were spatially dispersed, they could not be compared directly with trends in wet S deposition, because S deposition varied substantially between lakes within each cluster. However, the average trend in SO42- concentration was evaluated in each of 10 regions of Norway that were defined previously on the basis of pollution load, meteorological variables and biogeography. Although these regions did not match the statistically-selected clusters of lakes with equal trends very closely there were similar, strong correlations between climate indices (the AOI and NAOI) and the 10 average SO42- trends. although there were even stronger relationships with average wet S deposition in the regions. When subsets of lakes with coherent SO42- trends were selected from within each of the 10 regions, both wet S deposition and the climate indices were strongly correlated with those SO42- trends. Hence, lakes in Norway respond to changes in wet S deposition and are influenced by large-scale, i.e. global, climate signals. Future evaluation of recovery of lakes affected by acid deposition must therefore consider the confounding effects of climate and potential climate change.

AB Hydrological or hydraulic flood routing methods can be used to predict the floodplain influences on a flood wave as it passes along a river reach. While hydraulic routing uses both the equation of continuity and the equation of momentum to describe the dynamics of river flows, the simpler data requirements of hydrological routing makes it useful for preliminary estimates of the time and shape of a flood wave at successive points along a river. This paper presents a modified linear Muskingum hydrological routing method where the floodplain effects on flood peak attenuation and flood wave travel time are included in routing parameters. Developing the routing parameters initially involved routing hydrographs of different flood peak and duration through a 1-dimensional model of a generalised river reach in which a range of geometrical and resistance properties were varied. Comparison of upstream and simulated downstream hydrographs for each condition investigated, allowed the attenuation and travel time (storage constant, K, in standard Muskingum routing) of the flood wave to be estimated. Standard Muskingum routing was then used to develop downstream hydrographs for each K value together with assumed storage weighting factors (x) ranging from 0 to 0.5. Flood peak attenuations were again determined through comparison of the upstream and routed downstream hydrographs and with these, linear relationships between x and these attenuations were developed. Actual weighting factors, corresponding to storage constants, were subsequently determined using these relationships for all attenuations determined from the 1-dimensional model simulations. Using multi-variate regression analysis, the computed values of K and x were correlated to catchment and hydrograph properties and expressions for determining both K and x in terms of these properties were developed. The modified Muskingum routing method based on these regressed expressions for K and x was applied to a case study of the River Suir in Ireland where good agreement between measured and routed hydrographs was observed.

AB Modelling solute transport in the unsaturated zone is a complex problem given the inherent soil heterogeneity. Using time domain reflectometry (TDR) as described in this paper can improve data quality to be used in predictive models. The TDR technique requires appropriate calibration if it is to be used for solute concentration measurements under constant and varying water content. Two ways of determining the parameters in the relationship between bulk soil electrical conductivity, sigma(a), soil solution electrical conductivity, sigma(w), and volumetric water content, theta, were used. Among the two calibration methods tested here, the one which involved eluting the soil with several pore volumes of water of known electrical conductivity under transient flow conditions in an undisturbed soil column gave a linear sigma(w)-sigma(a)-theta relationship with depth dependent parameters. The other calibration method involved the use of disturbed soil under static conditions and resulted in a curvilinear sigma(w)-sigma(a)-theta relationship. The former calibration was subsequently used to determine solute concentrations in breakthrough experiments. Two solute transport experiments were carried out in the same undisturbed soil column; one for steady-state and one for transient flow condition. Parameters of the convective log normal transfer function (CLT) model were determined using time-integral-normalized resident concentrations. It was shown that the stochastic-convective approach described the experimental data well. Horizontal heterogeneity was mon important during the transient experiment, where the topsoil was periodically ponded during a short period, than in the steady-state experiment, where unsaturated conditions were maintained throughout the experiment. This increased heterogeneity during transient flow was also reflected by the fact that preferential solute flow was only observed in the column's outlet under transient conditions.

   rating curves
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A decision support system for fitting stage-discharge relations is being developed by the University of Manitoba, Facility for Intelligent Decision Support, for Environment Canada's hydrometric program. The process of developing and applying stage-discharge relationships has been documented, the decision support system framework established, and a number of expert 'rules' developed and evaluated for stable and non-stable channels. The system categorizes stage-discharge rating curves as stable if they deviate within a predetermined accuracy (e.g. +/- 5% of discharge), or if one of a suite of curves can be applied within the predetermined accuracy specifications for given changes in the energy slope caused by weed growth, channel ice and other conditions affecting backwater. Non-stable channels are defined as channels that experience evolution or abrupt changes in stage-discharge relationships resulting from changes in channel form. Rating curve stability is determined based on deviations in the stage-discharge relationship, utilizing specific gauge, absolute differences between sequential streamflow measurements and an analysis of residuals. Periods of instability, such as a meander cut-off changing the hydraulic control, are often repetitive in hydraulic response, such that a pattern of instability is recognizable as events occur. In addition, periods of instability are interspersed with periods of stability. The repetition in pattern allows knowledge of correctly identified historic events to be applied to contemporary hydraulic conditions. A suite of rating curves can be developed for specific periods (e.g. summer weed growth) and stages. These curves can be automatically applied based on changing streamflow conditions such that streamflow estimates can be generated in a rigorous and accurate manner with minimal hydrographer intervention.

AB The special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I) is an instrument that has been a component of several satellite platforms since 1987. Although not designed for soil moisture sensing, it is possible based on theory to extract soil moisture information under some conditions. The limiting feature of the SSM/I for soil moisture-related studies is that the frequencies are quite high and are significantly affected by vegetation. However, other features of the data, such as the frequency of measurements, are very good for observing time-varying hydrologic variables such as soil moisture. There have been no quantitative evaluations of the SSM/I using observed soil moisture data. In this study, data collected in two large-scale experiments conducted over the Little Washita watershed, in Oklahoma were available for evaluating the capabilities of SSM/I data for soil moisture mapping. Physically based models were used to relate the satellite data to the ground observations. The results indicated that for this grass-dominated subhumid area a soil moisture-emissivity relationship with an error of estimate of 5.3% could be developed that incorporated the range of temperature and vegetation conditions encountered. An approach to adapting this approach for other vegetation regimes is still needed for wider application.

AB Self-organized landscape patterning can arise in response to multiple processes. Discriminating among alternative patterning mechanisms, particularly where experimental manipulations are untenable, requires process-based models. Previous modeling studies have attributed patterning in the Everglades (Florida, USA) to sediment redistribution and anisotropic soil hydraulic properties. In this work, we tested an alternate theory, the self-organizing-canal (SOC) hypothesis, by developing a cellular automata model that simulates pattern evolution via local positive feedbacks (i.e., facilitation) coupled with a global negative feedback based on hydrology. The model is forced by global hydroperiod that drives stochastic transitions between two patch types: ridge (higher elevation) and slough (lower elevation). We evaluated model performance using multiple criteria based on six statistical and geostatistical properties observed in reference portions of the Everglades landscape: patch density, patch anisotropy, semivariogram ranges, power-law scaling of ridge areas, perimeter area fractal dimension, and characteristic pattern wavelength. Model results showed strong statistical agreement with reference landscapes, but only when anisotropically acting local facilitation was coupled with hydrologic global feedback, for which several plausible mechanisms exist. Critically, the model correctly generated fractal landscapes that had no characteristic pattern wavelength, supporting the invocation of global rather than scale-specific negative feedbacks.

AB A new technique, called the mixed-integer-chance-constrained programming (MICCP) method is developed in this research. This technique considers uncertainty in all linear programming constraint coefficients and does not require a priori knowledge of the distribution. A groundwater remediation problem serves as an example. The method is developed to find the globally optimal trade-off curve for maximum reliability versus a minimum pumping objective. As the fields became more heterogeneous, the pumping rate of a reliable solution increases. Four simple ''rule of thumb'' methods are compared to the MICCP technique. In general, the performance of such methods decreases as the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field increases.

It is shown how these distributions can be related to the fractal nature of single rivers and river networks. Finally, it is shown that the structure proposed here for these probability distributions is able to fit the observed frequency distributions, and their deviations from straight lines in a log-log plot.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID TRANSPORT
AB [1] This work presents a computational formulation of the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) approach to solve a stochastic partial differential equation (PDE) representing the advection-reaction process across space and time. The solution approach provided by BME has some important features that distinguish it from most standard stochastic PDE techniques. In addition to the physical law, the BME solution can assimilate other sources of general and site-specific knowledge, including multiple-point nonlinear space/time statistics, hard measurements, and various forms of uncertain (soft) information. There is no need to explicitly solve the moment equations of the advection-reaction law since BME allows the information contained in them to consolidate within the general knowledge base at the structural (prior) stage of the analysis. No restrictions are posed on the shape of the underlying probability distributions or the space/time pattern of the contaminant process. Solutions of nonlinear systems of equations are obtained in four space/time dimensions and efficient computational schemes are introduced to cope with complexity. The BME solution at the prior stage is in excellent agreement with the exact analytical solution obtained in a controlled environment for comparison purposes. The prior solution is further improved at the integration (posterior) BME stage by assimilating uncertain information at the data points as well as at the solution grid nodes themselves, thus leading to the final solution of the advection-reaction law in the form of the probability distribution of possible concentration values at each space/time grid node. This is the most complete way of describing a stochastic solution and provides considerable flexibility concerning the choice of the concentration realization that is more representative of the physical situation. Numerical experiments demonstrated a high solution accuracy of the computational BME approach. The BME approach can benefit from the use of parallel processing (the relevant systems of equations can be processed simultaneously at each grid node and multiple integrals calculations can be accelerated significantly, etc.).

AB River flow results from the interplay of numerous variables for which quantitative information is not easily available. The aim of this paper was to develop a river-flow forecasting model based only on rainfall and runoff information. The proposed model has been implemented with the combined utilization of two methods: a neural network method, which takes into account the non-linearity of the rainfall-runoff relationship and an adaptative technique, the Kalman filter, allowing real time correction of estimates. The rainfall-runoff relationship has been modelled on two rivers in northern France. The weekly and daily time step models gave satisfying forecasts, even for different lead times.

AB Pore-scale simulations of flow and transport offer the possibility of modeling laboratory-scale experiments without averaging the properties of the porous medium. Comparisons between simulation and experiment are complicated, however, by the difficulty of reproducing the exact geometry of the experimental porous medium in a simulation. Flow and dispersion are affected by differences in packing density, random packing variation, inhomogeneities, and confining walls. It is therefore important to understand the magnitude of such effects when comparing simulation and experiment. We quantify the sensitivity of pore-scale simulations of flow and dispersion to variations in packing density, the random packing algorithm, and selective sphere removal for the case of randomly packed spheres. The results allow us to interpret differences in dispersion between pore-scale simulations and NMR spectroscopy measurements in packed cylinders. Dispersion is analyzed in terms of the time-dependent dispersion coefficient and by the propagator function (i.e., the density function of solute mass versus mass propagation distance). The simulation and experimental propagator functions share important qualitative features, and there are no obvious problems such as an incorrect center of mass. However, the simulation underestimates experimental dispersion, and the underestimate is greater than can be explained by possible differences in packing density and random packing between the NMR and simulated sphere packings. An examination of NMR images of the experimental packing reveals regularities in packing structure and raises the possibility that nonrandom ordering could account for the difference in dispersion.

ID PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS; DERIVATION; WATER
AB The paper by Han and Tian (2020) reviews the history of developments in the complementary relationship (CR) between actual and potential evaporation and introduces the generalized complementary principle (GCP) developed by the authors. This comment assesses whether the GCP: (1) can give reasonable results from a wide range of surfaces worldwide; (2) is supported by experimental data that verify the three stages of evaporation implicit in the GCP, particularly in the wet-surface limit; (3) has been proven to be correct by the authors in a previous paper; and (4) is supported by model studies showing that wet surfaces occur predominantly during periods of large-scale moisture convergence. The assessment finds that arguments in favor of the GCP deserve to be taken seriously but ultimately remain unconvincing.

AB A comparative analysis or a variety of relationships for prediction of basin lag is performed by applying them to 23 basins located in the same geographical area and characterized by a rather similar vegetative cover. The results of computations indicate that a lag-area relationship with two constant parameters is the best predictor for most basins; under different vegetative covers in the same basin only one parameter should be variable. For a few other basins characterized by an anomalous drainage channel network of low density, such a relationship can lead to unacceptable errors. Thus, there is a need for an additional relationship to overcome this difficulty, but a larger number of anomalous basins would be required for its determination. An alternative procedure, based on the use of the non-linear kinematic wave, which at least allows singling out the cases where a specific lag-area relationship is not reliable, is proposed. This procedure, therefore, represents a partial but very useful solution to avoid considerable errors in hydrological practice. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Continued, accelerating water inequalities and conflicts in the postcolonial world cannot be properly grasped without a thorough understanding of colonialism and its legacies. At the same time, water as a resource provides an immensely useful lens for understanding the intricacies and the dynamics of the colonial and postcolonial eras, in general terms, and in the particular historical instance of Malawi examined here. This essay draws on a range of literaturessocial theory, political ecology, history, anthropology, sociology, geography, and so onto demonstrate that struggles over water and other natural resources in the postcolonial world are situated within wider global structures and relationships of power. Starting with a discussion of theoretical approaches to water, the essay goes on to examine the processes of state formation in Sub-Saharan Africa, and explore the intersectionality of the contemporary lived experience of class, gender, race, and ethnicity in this region. It ends with a consideration of social differentiation, land tenure, degradation of water resources and natural resource conflict in Malawi. Traversing across humanities and social science disciplines, this essay uses water as a means of cutting a path through world historical questions on the articulations between the global and the local in the present era.

TI STOCHASTIC CONCOMITANCE OF WATER-RESOURCES AND NEEDS
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB One of the simplest ways of determining the dimensions of and controlling water resources is by comparison of some water shortage index with an upper limit value, called water deficiency tolerance, based on economic considerations. The situation is considered satisfactory if water shortage is smaller than the limit value. Otherwise the dimensions and operating rules of system elements (such as the volumes of storage reservoirs and water intakes) have to be changed.
   Earlier workers gave several indices of water shortage and showed their calculation when water demand is a constant value and water resources are characterized by a probability distribution function. Methods for the calculation of water shortage indices in this particular case have been given.
   Indices of water shortage when water demand is not constant but a stochastic or deterministic relation exists between water demand and resources are examined.
   Indices characterizing the concomitance of two arbitrary random variables are considered. Flow discharges and water consumption of the Tisza basin provide examples of their use.
   The calculation of water shortage indices depends on the relationship between resources and demands: (a) If the relation between water resources and demand is stochastic, water shortage indices should be calculated either directly from the time functions of the two variables (by computer) or from their joint frequency function, by simple formulae; (b) if there is a deterministic functional monotonic, non-increasing relationship of unknown form, the water balance may be based on the duration functions of the two variables; (c) Finally, if the relationship between water resources and demand is known. the water shortage index can be calculated from a simple formula and the distribution function of water resources.

AB [1] Alternative general forms are considered for equations to predict mean velocity over the full range of relative submergence experienced in gravel- and boulder-bed streams. A partial unification is suggested for some previous semiempirical models and physical concepts. Two new equations are proposed: a nondimensional hydraulic geometry equation with different parameters for deep and shallow flows, and a variable-power resistance equation that is asymptotic to roughness-layer formulations for shallow flows and to the Manning-Strickler approximation of the logarithmic friction law for deep flows. Predictions by existing and new equations using D-84 as roughness scale are compared to a compilation of measured velocities in natural streams at relative submergences from 0.1 to over 30. The variable-power equation performs as well as the best existing approach, which is a logarithmic law with roughness multiplier. For predicting how a known or assumed discharge is partitioned between depth and velocity, a nondimensional hydraulic geometry approach outperforms equations using relative submergence. Factor-of-two prediction errors occur with all approaches because of sensitivity to operational definitions of depth, velocity, and slope, the inadequacy of using a single grain-size length scale, and the complexity of flow physics in steep shallow streams.

AB Human and hydrological systems are coupled: human activity impacts the hydrological cycle and hydrological conditions can, but do not always, trigger changes in human systems. Traditional modeling approaches with no feedback between hydrological and human systems typically cannot offer insight into how different patterns of natural variability or human-induced changes may propagate through this coupled system. Modeling of coupled human-hydrological systems, also called socio-hydrological systems, recognizes the potential for humans to transform hydrological systems and for hydrological conditions to influence human behavior. However, this coupling introduces new challenges and existing literature does not offer clear guidance regarding model conceptualization. There are no universally accepted laws of human behavior as there are for the physical systems; furthermore, a shared understanding of important processes within the field is often used to develop hydrological models, but there is no such consensus on the relevant processes in socio-hydrological systems. Here we present a question driven process to address these challenges. Such an approach allows modeling structure, scope and detail to remain contingent on and adaptive to the question context. We demonstrate the utility of this process by revisiting a classic question in water resources engineering on reservoir operation rules: what is the impact of reservoir operation policy on the reliability of water supply for a growing city? Our example model couples hydrological and human systems by linking the rate of demand decreases to the past reliability to compare standard operating policy (SOP) with hedging policy (HP). The model shows that reservoir storage acts both as a buffer for variability and as a delay triggering oscillations around a sustainable level of demand. HP reduces the threshold for action thereby decreasing the delay and the oscillation effect. As a result, per capita demand decreases during periods of water stress are more frequent but less drastic and the additive effect of small adjustments decreases the tendency of the system to overshoot available supplies. This distinction between the two policies was not apparent using a traditional noncoupled model.

AB This paper first presents a duration-dependent hypothesis regarding the parameters of the two component extreme value (TCEV) distribution and proposes a simple model to obtain the rainfall depth-duration relationship both at ungauged sites and at short record gauged sites in the Sicilian region. Then, by using the annual maximum peak flood and the annual maximum mean daily discharge recorded in Sicily, a TCEV hierarchical regional procedure is developed. An empirical estimation criterion which links the mean annual flood with the watershed area, and a modified rational formula in which a mean runoff coefficient is introduced, are proposed. Finally, two relationships are established for estimating the mean runoff coefficient, making use of the permeable watershed area and the wooded area.

AB Fresh submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is the key pathway of flux and nutrients for the groundwater from land to the ocean. SGD flux is a current issue of discussion and a means to clarify the coastal marine system under climate change. SGD flux accounts for about one-quarter of the river runoff in the Katakai alluvial fan in Uozu, Toyama, Japan, which is an ideal area to study SGD flux considering the need for a rapid response to climate change and the prior research on SGD there. In this paper, the monthly groundwater table's condition over 30 years is analyzed using monthly rainfall, snowfall, and the climate change index. Rainfall has been on an upward trend, but the snowfall has decreased over 40 years. Furthermore, the groundwater table at monitoring wells in the coastal area increased, as a result of the increased rainfall. However, the relationship between snowfall and groundwater is negative. As expected by Darcy's law, SGD flux was controlled by the hydraulic gradient of the coastal groundwater. The estimated historic SGD flux by groundwater table variation shows an upward trend of SGD. Considering the increase in precipitation and the groundwater table, SGD flux may increase under climate change.

AB Rainfall simulators have often been used to mimic natural rainfall for studies of various land-surface and water interaction processes. The characteristics of the simulated rainfall are the main indicators used to judge the performance of the rainfall simulators. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of piezoelectric transducers for measuring and evaluating a dripper-type simulated rainfall drop-size distribution (DSD) and kinetic energy (KE). The directly measured KE was significantly correlated with the estimated KE using the drop-size distribution and empirical rain drop fall velocity relationships. This result emphasizes the potential use of the piezoelectric sensor to directly measure and evaluate rainfall kinetic energy. Also, the relationship between rainfall intensity and KE showed good patterns of agreement between simulated rainfall and natural rainfall.

TI Diffusion processes in composite porous media and their numerical

LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSPORT; SIMULATION
AB Discontinuities in effective subsurface transport properties commonly arise (1) at abrupt contacts between geologic materials (i.e., in composite porous media) and (2) in discrete velocity fields of numerical groundwater-flow solutions. However, standard random-walk methods for simulating transport and the theory on which they are based (diffusion theory and the theory of stochastic differential equations (SDEs)) only apply when effective transport properties are sufficiently smooth. Limitations of standard theory have precluded development of random-walk methods (diffusion processes) that obey advection dispersion equations in composite porous media. In this paper we (1) generalize SDEs to the case of discontinuous coefficients (i.e., step functions) and (2) develop random-walk methods to numerically integrate these equations. The new random-walk methods obey advection-dispersion equations, even in composite media. The techniques retain many of the computational advantages of standard random-walk methods, including the ability to efficiently simulate solute-mass distributions and arrival times while suppressing errors such as numerical dispersion. Examples relevant to the simulation of subsurface transport demonstrate the new theory and methods. The results apply to problems found in many scientific disciplines and offer a unique contribution to diffusion theory and the theory of SDEs.

AB Throughfall is the dominant input of water to forests. Throughfall drop size and the distribution thereof are important because of their influence on the forest water balance, soil erosion, and, possibly, biogeochemical cycling. However, our inadequate understanding of throughfall drop size distributions has hampered progress in the identification of direct and indirect linkages between throughfall inputs and the biogeochemistry and physiological ecology of forests. This review provides a snapshot of our current understanding of throughfall drop size distributions by tracing the historical development of throughfall drop size studies and examining the determinants of throughfall drop size. The theory and methods of drop size studies also are reviewed to consolidate our collective knowledge of throughfall drop size distributions to date. Some of the gaps in our current knowledge, among many, include: (1) the effects of snowmelt on throughfall drop size; (2) the role and extent to which different canopy phenophases affect throughfall drop size; and (3) the extent to which throughfall drop size affects the chemistry of and biogeochemical cycling within forest soils. Closing these knowledge gaps will likely lead to the better conceptualization of rainfall partitioning processes and more definitive linkages between the cause-and-effect relationships between throughfall and soil erosion, forest biogeochemistry, and plant physiological ecology, for example.

DT Article

AB Recession analysis is a classical method in hydrology to assess watersheds' hydrological properties by means of the receding limb of a hydrograph, frequently expressed as the rate of change in discharge (- dQ/dt) against discharge (Q). This relationship is often assumed to take the form of a power law -dQ/dt = a Q(b), where a and b are recession parameters. Recent studies have highlighted major differences in the estimation of the recession parameters depending on the method, casting doubt on our ability to properly evaluate and compare hydrological properties across watersheds based on recession analysis of -dQ/dt vs. Q. This study shows that estimation based on collective recessions as an average watershed response is strongly affected by the distributions of event inter-arrival time, magnitudes, and antecedent conditions, implying that the resulting recession parameters do not represent watershed properties as much as they represent the climate. The main outcome from this work highlights that proper evaluation of watershed properties is only ensured by considering independent individual recession events. While average properties can be assessed by considering the average (or median) values of a and b, their variabilities provide critical insight into the sensitivity of a watershed to the initial conditions involved prior to each recharge event.

AB Understanding the dynamics of the various components (and the mechanisms involved) in a river system and establishing precise relationships between the m are important for an accurate description of the sediment transport phenomenon. Despite the significant progress achieved in the last century with the development of a variety of approaches, there is no generally accepted simple relationship between the components, A preliminary attempt is made herein to address the sediment transport problem from a low-dimensional chaotic dynamical perspective. Such an approach assumes that the seemingly complex behaviour of the sediment transport phenomenon can be the outcome of a simple deterministic system influenced by a few dominant nonlinear interdependent variables sensitive to initial conditions. As a first step towards assessing the validity of such a hypothesis, the dynamical behaviours of three important (and related) components of the sediment transport phenomenon. i.e. water discharge, suspended sediment concentration and bed load, in the Mississippi River basin (at St Louis, Missouri), USA are studied. The correlation dimension method is employed to identify the dynamical behaviour (chaotic or stochastic). The results indicate that the three components exhibit low-dimensional chaotic behaviour. A possible implication of such results could be that the complete sediment transport phenomenon might also exhibit low-dimensional chaotic behaviour. Efforts towards analysing the other components of the sediment transport system and establishing relationships between them are underway.

AB [1] Most common methods used in optimal control of reservoir systems require a large number of control variables, which are typically the sequences of releases from all reservoirs and for all time steps of the control period. In contrast, the less widespread parameterization-simulation-optimization (PSO) method is a low-dimensional method. It uses a handful of control variables, which are parameters of a simple rule that is valid through the entire control period and determines the releases from different reservoirs at each time step. The parameterization of the rule is linked to simulation of the reservoir system, which enables the calculation of a performance measure of the system for given parameter values, and nonlinear optimization, which enables determination of the optimal parameter values. To evaluate the PSO method and, particularly, to investigate whether the radical reduction of the number of control variables might lead to inferior solutions or not, we compare it to two alternative methods. These methods, namely, the high-dimensional perfect foresight method and the simplified "equivalent reservoir'' method that merges the reservoir system into a single hypothetical reservoir, determine "benchmark'' performance measures for the comparison. The comparison is done both theoretically and by investigation of the results of the PSO against the benchmark methods in a large variety of test problems. Forty-one test problems for a hypothetical system of two reservoirs are constructed and solved for comparison. These refer to different objectives (maximization of reliable yield, minimization of cost, maximization of energy production), water uses (irrigation, water supply, energy production), characteristics of the reservoir system and hydrological scenarios. The investigation shows that PSO yields solutions that are not inferior to those of the benchmark methods and, simultaneously, it has several theoretical, computational, and practical advantages.

AB The influence of geometrical and structural properties of layered fractured rocks on their permeability tensor is investigated for an elementary volume at the meter scale. Various synthetic networks were generated with a three-dimensional model that incorporates a pseudo-random process controlled by mechanical rules of fracturing. The permeability is supposed to be a function of the discontinuities aperture in an impermeable matrix. Steady state, saturated laminar flow is assumed within discontinuities of constant aperture (parallel joint watts). For 81 networks associated to different sets of numerical parameters, the geometrical and structural properties are computed from 200 statistically equivalent simulations and averaged to asses the mean geometrical and structural properties. In a similar way, the mean permeability tensor associated to each network is calculated. Then, the effect of the geometrical and structural properties of the network on the permeability tensor values is studied. We show that some geometrical and structural properties may have non-negligible effects: The bedding perpendicular joint spacing and the bedding plane stopping capacity can induce more than one order of magnitude change in the permeability values, while other investigated properties (mean and standard deviation of the bedding perpendicular joints length distribution) have a very small influence. These results were compared with the permeability tensor inferred from one analytical model which provided permeability values of the same order of magnitude as those inferred from the numerical model. This model can thus be considered within the hierarchical procedure proposed to characterize rock mass permeability tensors in the field. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Speleothems (cave deposits), used for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, are deposited from cave drip water. Differentiating climate and karst processes within a drip-water signal is fundamental for the correct identification of palaeoenvironmental proxies and ultimately their interpretation within speleothem records. We investigate the potential use of trace element and stable oxygen-isotope (delta O-18) variations in cave drip water as palaeorainfall proxies in an Australian alpine karst site. This paper presents the first extensive hydrochemical and delta O-18 dataset from Harrie Wood Cave, in the Snowy Mountains, south-eastern (SE) Australia. Using a 7-year long rainfall delta O-18 and drip-water Ca, Cl, Mg / Ca, Sr / Ca and delta O-18 datasets from three drip sites, we determined that the processes of mixing, dilution, flow path change, carbonate mineral dissolution and prior calcite precipitation (PCP) accounted for the observed variations in the drip-water geochemical composition. We identify that the three monitored drip sites are fed by fracture flow from a well-mixed epikarst storage reservoir, supplied by variable concentrations of dissolved ions from soil and bedrock dissolution. We constrained the influence of multiple processes and controls on drip-water composition in a region dominated by El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During the El Nino and dry periods, enhanced PCP, a flow path change and dissolution due to increased soil CO2 production occurred in response to warmer than average temperatures in contrast to the La Nina phase, where dilution dominated and reduced PCP were observed. We present a conceptual model, illustrating the key processes impacting the drip-water chemistry. We identified a robust relationship between ENSO and drip-water trace element concentrations and propose that variations in speleothem Mg / Ca and Sr / Ca ratios may be interpreted to reflect palaeorainfall conditions. These findings inform palaeorainfall reconstruction from speleothems regionally and provide a basis for palaeoclimate studies globally, in regions where there is intermittent recharge variability.

AB An understanding of the dominant controls on water fluxes through landscapes at scales smaller than the resolution of a hydrologic model is useful for choosing appropriate parameterizations, and for developing a classification system for landscape hydrology. The links between these controls and the parameters in hillslope-scale models of subsurface lateral saturated flow have been treated implicitly in both physical (e. g., Characteristic Response Function) and empirical formulations, such as power law storage-discharge relations. In particular, the controls exerted by the boundary condition at the toe of the hilslope and the temporal variability of the recharge have not been integrated with the understanding of the controls of topography and soil properties. In this work, we develop a dimensionless similarity framework for assessing these controls on the subsurface flow dynamics, based on the Boussinesq equation in an idealized hillslope system. Using this framework we demonstrate the relationship between (1) the exponents of the storage-discharge relations, (2) the boundary conditions and (3) the characteristic storage thickness used in the Characteristic Response Function parameterization. We use the concept of hydrologic regimes to incorporate information about the population of recharge events that drive the system and set up the initial condition of saturated storage for each storm event. The analysis demonstrates that for planar hillslopes with uniform soil properties, exponents range between 0 (when the flow through the hillslope is dominated by the topographic gradients, and is in the early stages of draining) and 2 (when the flow is driven by water table gradients, and the thickness of the aquifer at the seepage face is small compared to the average thickness). The similarity framework can be used to make first-order predictions of these exponents, and classify hillslopes using a simple typology of subsurface flows based on two components of the behavior: the relative dominance of the topographic and water-table gradients, and the responsiveness of the hillslope discharge to temporal variability of the recharge inputs.

The presence of a drain or well in both examples generates a free boundary, the stagnation zone boundary, separating flowing groundwater from stagnant groundwater. We use complex analysis, the hodograph, and the Milne-Thomson circle theorem to evaluate the position of the free boundary directly, without resorting to conformal mapping.

AB In spite of its official recognition by the United Nations in 2010, the human right to water remains a contested notion as illustrated by three main debates: (a) the definition of its scope, content, and indicators to monitor its implementation; (b) the conceptual appropriateness and effectiveness of the human rights approach in countering water services privatization; (c) the call for decolonizing or decentering the western, liberal, individualistic, and anthropocentric approach of the human right to water. The article introduces the main themes and insights within these debates and concludes by pointing at potential future research at their intersection, in relation to (a) other species' rights, (b) culture and religion, and (c) technology and infrastructure.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID PRODUCTION INVENTORY SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION
AB The reservoir management problem for a hydrothermal power system is well suited to modeling via dynamic programing. In this paper we describe a dual approach which we term "constructive dynamic programming" (CDP) which has been successfully applied to optimize :releases in a stochastic two-reservoir model of the New Zealand power system. That model ignores serial correlations of inflows, though, and hence assumes that current inflow observations do not have any impact on future release decisions. Tests show, however, that better decision rules can be produced by accounting for inflow correlation. Hence we have developed an extension to the standard CDP to explicitly deal with serial correlation of reservoir inflows, and we report on those extensions also.

TI THE EFFECT OF PROPERTIES OF SEDIMENT TYPE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
   SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATION AND RADIANCE
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB A laboratory experiment was designed to determine the spectral characteristics of different types of sediment suspended in water in the visible and near infrared wavelengths (0.45-0.9 mum) using a four-channel radiometer. Field collected sediments were resuspended in water to produce different concentration levels for the measurement of radiance. Spectral measurements of turbid water showed a distinctive difference in the behaviour of radiance with change in the inorganic suspended sediment concentration and type. It was noted that the correlation between the suspended sediment concentration and the radiance varied with the mineral composition of the sediment. The clay minerals of low specific gravity had larger values of radiance than those from high specific gravity nonclay minerals. Based on the results obtained, it appears that an algorithm to estimate suspended sediment concentration can be developed from radiance.

AB A global hydrological model was calibrated by rainfall events of varying duration (from 1 to 10 days). The events considered were those separated by at least one non-rainy day on each side, and not causing reservoir spillage. The input of this model includes mean rainfall over the catchment, and the Kohler & Linsley antecedent precipitation index. The expressions of the hydrological model for the beginning and the middle of wet season, according to a threshold of the cumulative rainfall since the start of the rainy season, are in a polynomial nonlinear form of the second order. This model proved to be capable of estimating runoff correctly, in spite of the small number of raingauges (one) for the catchment size of 48 km(2). The absence of other rainfall stations over the catchment area did not allow the accuracy of the model to be studied by assessing mean rainfall over the catchment rather than the rainfall at the single site of Ghezala Dam.

AB Solute diffusion flux in soil is described by Fick's law along with a tortuosity factor to account for the tortuous and reduced diffusive pathway blocked by soil particles. Predictive models based on empirical or conceptual relationships with other more commonly measured soil attributes have been proposed to replace the time-consuming and multifarious laboratory measurements. However, these models have not been systematically tested and evaluated with soils of different textures under comparable conditions. This study determined solute diffusion coefficients and calculated tortuosity factors of a sand, a sandy clay loam, and a clay at various degrees of water saturation, and used the experimental data to test the predictive capabilities of these models. All the test models can fit the experimental data reasonably well as evidenced by low root mean square errors (RMSEs). When the proposed (fixed) parameter values were used, the widely accepted Millington and Quirk tortuosity model resulted in highest RMSEs for all three test soils. In terms of model efficiency as described by Akaike weight, however, the tortuosity factors of the sand and sandy clay loam soils are best represented by a quadratic function of volumetric soil water content (with the largest Akaike weights), while the combined parallel-series conceptual model assuming different configurations of film and pore water is the best for the clay soil. The Olesen power function tortuosity model has the second largest Akaike weights for the sand and sandy clay loam soils, while the So and Nye linear model has the second largest Akaike weight for the clay soil. The two-region linear model of log (tortuosity factor) versus soil water content uses a similar framework to the conceptual model, and it can satisfactorily fit to the experimental data well (low RMSEs), but with low Akaike weights due to the large number of parameters in the model. Adaption of the findings from this study may substantially improve solute diffusion modeling in unsaturated porous media.

AB The study of unconfined steady aquifer flow is usually based on either the numerical integration of the Laplace equation or on its analytical solution using the complex variable theory. A further approach that uses Adomian's method of decomposition yields simple analytical solutions in higher dimensions, does not require linearisation of the free-surface boundary condition and yields the elevation of the seepage face. A common approach is the introduction of simplified one-dimensional models that are often accurate enough for practical applications. However, the water table estimates derived by the so-called Dupuit-Forchheimer theory do not always fulfil the required accuracy. This work improves the Dupuit-Forcheimer hypotheses to obtain more precise results. For this purpose, the stream function of the groundwater flow net is formulated in natural, curvilinear coordinates. Next, an approximate one-dimensional model for the water table height is derived considering Darcy's law, retaining the curved features of the flow net. The proposed model is a higher order Dupuit-Forchheimer type approach, which was favourably compared with 2D results for Polubarinova-Kochina's rectangular dam problem and the drainage to symmetrically located ditches under steady-state conditions.

TI DETERMINATION OF GAS-EXCHANGE RATE CONSTANTS FOR A SMALL STREAM ON
   WALKER BRANCH WATERSHED, TENNESSEE
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The steady state tracer gas method was used to determine gas exchange rate constants (k) for a small stream (annual average flow less-than-or-equal-to 1 m3/min) draining the West Fork of Walker Branch watershed in eastern Tennessee. Chloride was used as a conservative tracer to account for dilution by lateral inflow, and propane and ethane were used as volatile tracers. Gas exchange rate constants for propane (k(p)) were about 100 d-1 over a wide range of flow conditions, while those for ethane (k(e)) were about 117 d-1; an equivalent rate constant for O2 (k(O2)) would be about 118-139 d-1, depending on the method used for its calculation. These rate constants are much larger than those typically found in rivers and large streams. Much lower k(p) values (about 50 d-1) were found during one experiment conducted at low flow with much of the stream surface covered with floating leaves. Nineteen previously published empirical equations were used to predict k(O2) values for one 72-m stream reach; agreement between the predicted and measured values was generally very poor, underscoring the importance of field-measured gas exchange rates in studies of the transport and fate of volatile compounds. Because ethane and propane have similar gas exchange rates and similar aqueous diffusion coefficients (k(e)/k(p) and D(e)/D(p) are both close to 1, where D is the compound's diffusion coefficient), accurate determination of the exponent n in the relationship k(e)/k(p) = (D(e)/D(p))n was not possible. The ratio k(e)/k(p) (1.17) is much closer to D(e)/D(p) (1.24) than H(e)/H(p) (0.82, where H is the compound's Henry's law constant), suggesting that stripping of dissolved volatiles by air bubbles was not a dominant mode of gas exchange for the study stream.

AB Unpublished chemical and isotopic data taken in November 1992 from the three major Saharan aquifers, namely the Continental Intercalaire (CI), the Complexe Terminal (CT) and the phreatic aquifer (Phr), were integrated with original samples in order to chemically and isotopically characterize the largest Saharan aquifer system and investigate the processes through which groundwaters acquire their mineralization. Instead of classical Debye-Huckel extended law, a specific interaction theory (SIT) model, recently incorporated in PHREEQC 3.0, was used. Inverse modeling of hydrochemical data constrained by isotopic data was used here to quantitatively assess the influence of geochemical processes: at depth, the dissolution of salts from the geological formations during upward leakage without evaporation explains the transitions from CI to CT and to a first end member, a cluster of Phr (cluster I); near the surface, the dissolution of salts from sabkhas by rainwater explains another cluster of Phr (cluster II). In every case, secondary precipitation of calcite occurs during dissolution. All Phr waters result from the mixing of these two clusters together with calcite precipitation and ion exchange processes. These processes are quantitatively assessed by the PHREEQC model.

ID POROUS-MEDIA; VAPOR EXTRACTION; TRANSPORT; MODEL
AB Experiments investigating the mass transfer of several dissolved volatile organic compounds (VOCs) across the air-water interface were conducted using a single-air-channel air-sparging system. Three different porous media were used in the study. Air velocities ranged from 0.2 cm s(-1) to 2.5 cm s(-1). The tortuosity factor for each porous medium and the air-water mass transfer coefficients were estimated by fitting experimental data to a one-dimensional diffusion model. The estimated mass transfer coefficients K-G ranged from 1.79 x 10(-3) cm min(-1) to 3.85 x 10(-2) cm min(-1). The estimated lumped gas phase mass transfer coefficients K(G)a were found to be directly related to the air diffusivity of the vee, air velocity, and particle size, and inversely related to the Henry's law constant of the VOCs. Of the four parameters investigated, the parameter that controlled or had a dominant effect on the lumped gas phase mass transfer coefficient was the air diffusivity of the VOC. Two empirical models were developed by correlating the Damkohler and the modified air phase Sherwood numbers with the air phase Peclet number, Henry's law constant, and the reduced mean particle size of porous media. The correlation developed in this study may be used to obtain better predictions of mass transfer Auras for field conditions.

ID POLITICS; WATER; INFRASTRUCTURE
AB This paper takes a qualitative, context-specific approach to governance in hydro-power development in India by identifying and describing three modes that are important to planning and operations in this sector. Attention is given to the role of documents and citizen actions in the courts, expanding the coverage of water informality in India. Rent-seeking is also identified as a mode of governance. This qualitative examination draws from policy and official documents, testimonies, and citizen-justice interactions to shed light on cultural practices and rules that are opaque to the outsider. Analysis of the interplay of these modes of governance forms a deeper understanding of the human dimensions of hydroclimatic challenges across the Himalayas. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   CONDUCTIVITY; PERMEABILITY; AQUIFERS; BOUNDARY
AB The properties of nonuniform average potential flows in media of stationary random conductivity are studied. The mathematical model of average flow is derived as a system of governing equations to be satisfied by mean velocity and mean head. The averaged Darcy's law determines the effective conductivity as an integral operator of the convolution type, relating the mean velocity to the mean head gradient in a nonlocal way. In Fourier domain the mean velocity is proportional to the mean head gradient. The coefficient of proportionality is referred to as the effective conductivity tenser and is derived by perturbation methods in terms of functionals of the conductivity spatial moments. It is shown that the effective conductivity cannot be defined uniquely for potential flows. However, this nonuniqueness does not affect the spatial distribution of the mean head and velocity. Analytical expressions of the effective conductivity tenser are derived for two- and three-dimensional flows and for exponential and Gaussian correlations of isotropic conductivity. The fundamental solution of the governing equations in effective media (mean Green function) is calculated for the same cases. Two new asymptotic models of the averaged Darcy's law are developed to be applicable to large and small scales of heterogeneity. Several asymptotic expansions of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional mean Green functions are derived for exponential and Gaussian correlations.

AB The evolution of frictional strength, stability, and fracture permeability is intimately linked both to the seismic cycle and to the impact of hydraulic stimulation for fractured reservoirs. However, despite this importance, the poromechanical relationships between fault permeability and strength remain unclear. The present study explores this relationship via laboratory experiments for concurrent shear-flow on smooth fractures of Westerly granite. The novelty of these experiments is that the shear velocity is precisely controlled during the measurement of fracture permeability. Results indicate permeability enhancement during velocity-weakening (potentially unstable) frictional slip. To decipher key processes contributing to this response, we evaluate the state of contacting asperities and of fracture surface asperities via digital rock fracture modeling of statistically equivalent surfaces. We propose two plausible mechanisms constraining the relationship between friction and permeability evolutionone based on changes in asperity contact distribution and one on shear-induced dilation triggered by changes in fault slip velocity. These mechanisms should be taken into account in interpreting field observation such as the abrupt permeability increase of natural faults at the onset of seismic slip.

AB Methodologies for developing a macro-scale model of subsurface stormflow generation on a steep forested catchment in Japan are addressed. Field studies on this catchment have indicated that subsurface flow, consisting mainly of 'old' water displaced by 'new' rain water, dominates the storm response. Detailed field measurements on the catchment allowed simple, catchment-scale relationships to be developed between the volume of saturated groundwater, on the one hand, and discharge, and surface and subsurface saturated areas, on the other. Attempts are made to find linkages between these empirical relationships and physically-based descriptions of hydrological processes operating at smaller scales. A distributed model based on the saturated-unsaturated groundwater flow on steep catchments was developed and tested with field data collected on this catchment. Derivation of catchment-scale relationships can be carried out by a straightforward integration of the distributed model output. An alternative disaggregation-aggregation approach is presented, whereby the catchment is divided into a number of hillslope flow strips. By applying the distributed model on each flow strip, under steady-state conditions, it is possible to infer the spatial variability of groundwater volume in the various flow strips. This variability is related to a measure of hillslope topography and geometry. Knowing the catchment topography and geometry for any catchment, it is then possible to derive useful catchment-scale relationships which are applicable under quasi-steady-state conditions. Hydrological relationships derived in this manner are compared with corresponding empirical relationships. The methodologies presented are effective for understanding the linkages between catchment scale response and small-scale flow processes.

AB Proper mathematical description of multiphase fluid displacement in porous media requires specification of appropriate constitutive relations, including the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation.  This pressure-saturation relationship may be measured at the laboratory core scale, but extension to larger scales is difficult in heterogeneous materials.  To date, stochastic and volume averaging methods have been used to estimate the "effective" pressure-saturation relation in heterogeneous media.  A third method, based on network percolation models, may be developed and used to define effective relationships.  This last method is appealing in that pore scale physics are directly incorporated into the model, assumptions are clear, and numerical tests are most similar to those performed in the laboratory.  Numerical results based on network models indicate that heterogeneities have a significant impact on the effective relationship.  In addition, these results indicate that application of any sort of linear averaging of the individual small-scale relationships to define an effective relationship may provide incorrect results.

AB In the past decade far-reaching reforms have taken place in the Australian water industry. Extensive restructuring of water administration has been accompanied by increased evidence of willingness by public agencies to consider alternative institutional arrangements to the traditional regulatory approach to water allocation and use. In irrigated agriculture, a market-based system linked to enforceable property rights to water is seen as preferable to rule-based management of water resources. However, significant social and economic considerations and political realities constrain the unfettered operation of water markets. The challenge facing the irrigation industry in Australia is to put in place institutional arrangements which reflect the most appropriate mix of incentive-based and regulatory mechanisms for water management.

AB The relative performance of an explicit grid cell by grid cell approach and a statistical-dynamical method widely used in Topmodel for modeling topographically driven subsurface flow was evaluated using a series of numerical experiments. Both approaches were compared with analytical solutions to the kinematic wave equation for flow down an inclined plane of constant slope. The hillslope discharge and water table profiles simulated by the explicit method were in good agreement with the analytical solution in all test cases. The statistical-dynamical method converged to the correct steady state solution but failed to reproduce accurately transient conditions. The two algorithms were also compared using topography and observed hourly precipitation for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Mahantango, Pennsylvania, research catchment. The percent root-mean-square-difference in hourly discharge between the two methods for a 1 year simulation ranged from 20% to several hundred percent. The agreement in discharge between the two methods was best for deep soils, high surface conductivity, and large values of the power law exponent describing the decay in vertical hydraulic conductivity with depth. "Calibration" of the statistical-dynamical model to discharge simulated by the explicit method was most effective for soils with low power law exponents. However, even in the calibrated cases, there were large discrepancies between local water table depths simulated by the two models.

TI Phase-space analysis of daily streamflow: characterization and
   prediction
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES

AB This paper describes a methodology, based on dynamical systems theory, to model and predict streamflow at the daily scale. The model is constructed by developing a multidimensional phase-space map from observed streamflow signals. Predictions are made by examining trajectories oil the reconstructed phase space. Prediction accuracy is used as a diagnostic tool to characterize the nature. which ranges from low-order deterministic to stochastic, of streamflow signals. To demonstrate the utility of this diagnostic tool, the proposed method is first applied to a time series with known characteristics. The paper shows that the proposed phase-space model can be used to make a tentative distinction between a noisy signal and a deterministic chaotic signal.
   The proposed phase-space model is then applied to daily streamflow records for 28 selected stations from the Continental United States covering basin areas between 31 and 35079 km(2). Based on the analyses of these 28 streamflow time series and 13 artificially generated signals with known characteristics, no direct relationship between the nature of underlying streamflow characteristics and basin area has been found. In addition, there does not appear to be any physical threshold (in terms of basin area, average flow rate and yield) that controls the change in streamflow dynamics at the daily scale. These results suggest that the daily streamflow signals span a wide dynamical range between deterministic chaos and periodic signal contaminated with additive noise.

SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

ID GEOCHEMISTRY; WATERS
AB Reports on the occurrence of fluoride in natural water resources and the associated health hazards due to human consumption have been made from many parts of India during the last decade. With the objective of organizing a systematic scientific programme to understand the behaviour of fluoride in natural water resources in relation to the local hydrogeological and climatic conditions and agricultural use, a typical area constituting the lower Vamsadhara River basin was chosen for a detailed study. fluoride concentrations in the groundwater reaching a maximum of 3.4 mg l(-1) were observed to be associated with weathered formations of pyroxene amphibolites and pegmatites. The groundwater in the clayey soils contained much less fluoride as compared to the sandy soils. The complex depositional pattern of these sandy and clayey soils plays an important role in the uneven spatial distribution of fluoride in the groundwater. The contribution of fluoride from geological formations is far greater than that from agriculture: the maximum yield of fluoride by superphosphate fertilizer to irrigation water is observed to be 0.34 mg l(-1). The fluoride concentration is expected to be increased in the future as the groundwater is subsaturated with respect to fluorite. An inverse relationship between F and Ca and positive relationships of F with Na, HCO3, PO4 and electrical conductivity were observed. Best relationships were obtained in the fluoride range of 1.0-3.4 mg l(-1).

ID EVOLUTION
AB One year of instantaneous suspended sediment concentration, C, and instantaneous discharge, Q, data collected at Ngarradj downstream of the Jabiluka mine site indicate that the use of a simple C-Q rating curve is not a reliable method for estimating suspended sediment loads from the Ngarradj catchment. The C-Q data are not only complicated by hysteresis effects within the rising and falling stages of individual events, but also by variable depletion of available suspended sediment through multipeaked runoff events.
   Parameter values were fitted to an event-based suspended sediment load-Q relationship as an alternative to the C-Q relationship. Total suspended sediment load and Q data for 10 observed events in the Ngarradj stream catchment were used to fit parameter values to a suspended sediment load-Q relationship, using (a) log-log regression and (b) iterative parameter fitting techniques. A more reliable and statistically significant prediction of suspended sediment load from the Ngarradj catchment is obtained using an event-based suspended sediment load-Q relationship. Fitting parameters to the event-based suspended sediment load-Q relationship using iterative techniques better predicts long-term suspended sediment loads compared with log-log regression techniques.

AB A model for daily rainfall occurrence and daily rainfall amount is fitted to the data of Dedougou, in the Sudano-Sahelian zone. The fitting is performed in a Bayesian framework using the Hastings procedure which allows for a full representation of parameter uncertainty. The method is based on a comparison of any observed characteristic of the rainy season to its predictive law. If and only if the observation falls into the central part of the predictive distribution the model is judged to describe the characteristic under scrutiny. Using this method, several records were studied. It is shown that the model preserves the commonly used hydrological records like daily and annual precipitation, number of rainy days per year, rainy sequence length. The model depicts the climatic change which occurred in the late sixties. The Markovian hypothesis, on which the model is based, is validated. The independence hypothesis between rainfall amounts in two successive days does not hold. The extreme daily rainfall values are consistent with the largest values generated by the model.

TI One-dimensional transient flow in a finite fractured aquifer system
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB A confined finite fractured aquifer bounded by a stream on one side and by an impervious boundary on the other is considered. Unsteady flow in the aquifer resulting from a sudden rise (or drop) of water level in the river stage is analysed. The governing differential equations are based on the double porosity conceptual model with the assumption of pseudo-steady state fracture-to-block flow. By applying finite Fourier sine and Laplace transform techniques to the governing equations, analytical solutions for the piezometric head distribution are obtained. By applying Darcy's law the time-dependent flow rate to (or from) the aquifer per unit length of the stream is evaluated. For negligible storage coefficient or hydraulic conductivity of the blocks, the new solutions reduce to known forms. The proposed analytical solutions may be useful in predicting the variations in the water levels in the aquifer as well as evaluating the time-dependent flow rates especially in the analysis of recession hydrographs in the streams. The solutions may also be used for the identification of the aquifer properties and for numerical model validation.

AB The increased frequency and magnitude of extreme rainfall events due to anthropogenic climate change, and decadal and multi-decadal climate variability question the stationary climate assumption. The possible violation of stationarity in climate can cause erroneous estimation of design rainfalls derived from extreme rainfall frequency analysis. This may result in significant consequences for infrastructure and flood protection projects since design rainfalls are essential input for design of these projects. Therefore, there is a need to conduct frequency analysis of extreme rainfall events in the context of non-stationarity, when non-stationarity is present in extreme rainfall events. A methodology consisting of threshold selection, extreme rainfall data (peaks over threshold data) construction, trend and nonstationarity analysis, and stationary and non-stationary generalised Pareto distribution (GPD) models was developed in this paper to investigate trends and non-stationarity in extreme rainfall events, and potential impacts of climate change and variability on intensity-frequency-duration (IFD) relationships. The methodology developed was successfully implemented using rainfall data from an observation station in Melbourne (Australia) for storm durations ranging from 6 min to 72 h. Although statistically significant trends were detected in extreme rainfall data for storm durations of 30 min, 3 h and 48 h, statistical non-stationarity tests and non-stationary GPD models did not indicate non-stationarity for these storm durations and other storm durations. It was also found that the stationary GPD models were capable of fitting extreme rainfall data for all storm durations. Further-more, the IFD analysis showed that urban flash flood producing hourly rainfall intensities have increased over time.

AB The traditional Richards' equation implies that the wetting front in unsaturated soil follows Boltzmann scaling, with travel distance growing as the square root of time. This study proposes a fractal Richards' equation (FRE), replacing the integer-order time derivative of water content by a fractal derivative, using a power law ruler in time. FRE solutions exhibit anomalous non-Boltzmann scaling, attributed to the fractal nature of heterogeneous media. Several applications are presented, fitting the FRE to water content curves from previous literature. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Relative velocities of discharge and sediment waves for the River
   Severn, UK
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

DT Article
AB It is generally accepted that the celerity of a discharge wave exceeds that of a floodwave. The discharge wave is the initial wavefront (shown by an increase in stage at a particular site), whereas the floodwave refers to the body of water moving downstream. Yet, few studies have investigated the varying relationship between discharge and suspended sediment concentration as floods propagate downstream. This paper examines the relative velocities of the discharge and sediment waves for natural flood events on the River Severn, UK. Four monitoring stations were established within the upper 35 km reach of the River Severn (drainage basin area 380 km(2)). Discharge was monitored using fixed structures, and suspended sediment concentrations were monitored at similar locations using Partech IR40C turbidity meters. Results showed discharge wave celerity increased with flood magnitude, but relationships were more complex for sediment wave celerity. Sediment wave celerity was greater than discharge wave celerity, and is attributed to the dominant source of sediment, which is most probably bank erosion.

AB Topographic influences on groundwater flow processes that contribute to baseflow and mountain block recharge (MBR) are conceptually investigated using three-dimensional numerical models of saturated groundwater flow. Model domains for conceptual and real topographies are developed as "mountain groundwatershed units'' (MGUs) to represent regional-scale watershed systems. Results indicate regularity in groundwater flow patterns that reflect consistency of prominent topographic features, providing a basis for conceptualizing three-dimensional groundwater flow. Baseflow is generated mainly from recharge within the watershed area. MBR is produced primarily from recharge that is focused across triangular facets near the mountain front (similar to 73%-97% of total MBR), with additional contributions originating within the watershed (up to similar to 27% of MBR). MBR contributions originating from recharge near the highest-elevation watershed boundaries are minimal but are greater for topography with less stream incision. With orographic influences, more MBR originates within the watershed. MBR rates are relatively consistent between models because of similarities in mountain front topography, while baseflow is variable. Gains and losses to systems via cross-watershed groundwater flux, generated because of topographic differences between adjacent watersheds, cause baseflow to vary by up to similar to 10% but do not significantly influence MBR. In data-sparse regions such as mountains, a basic numerical modeling approach, using the MGU concept with topography data and mapped watershed boundaries, can be used to develop site-specific conceptual models to constrain water budgets, to delineate recharge areas, and to guide further investigation and data collection.

AB The Heaslet-Alksne technique solved the nonlinear diffusion equation by expansion around the wetting front for power taw diffusivities. Essentially the same technique has been applied when a well-defined wetting front exists at a finite distance. In this paper, the method is extended for an arbitrary diffusivity and to the case when there is no well-defined wetting front at a finite distance. Two illustrations for exponential and power law diffusivities show the excellent accuracy of the method.

AB The frequency and intensity of drought are increasing dramatically with global warming. However, few studies have characterized drought in terms of its impacts on ecosystem services, the mechanisms through which ecosystems support life. As a result, little is known about the implications of increased drought for resource management. This case study characterizes drought by linking climate anomalies with changes in the precipitation-runoff relationship (PRR) on the Loess Plateau of China, a water-limited region where ongoing revegetation makes drought a major concern. We analyzed drought events with drought durations >= 5 years and mean annual precipitation anomaly (PA) values <= -5% during drought periods. The results show that continuous precipitation shifts are able to change the water balance of watersheds in water-limited areas, and multi-year drought events cause the PRR to change with a significantly decreasing trend (p < 0.05) compared to other historical records. For the Loess Plateau as a whole, the average runoff ratio decreased from 10 to 6.8 % during 1991-1999. The joint probability and return period gradually increase with increasing of drought duration and severity. The ecosystem service of water yield is easily affected by drought events with durations equal to or greater than 6 years and drought severity values equal to or greater than 0.55 (precipitation <= 212 mm). At the same time, multi-year drought events also lead to significant changes in the leaf area index (LAI). Such studies are essential for ecosystem management in water-limited areas.

AB This study compares published cartometric and photogrammetric digital elevation models (DEMs) of various grid spacings with a ground truth data set, obtained by ground survey, and studies the implications of these differences on key hydrologic statistics. Inferred catchment sizes and stream networks from published DEMs were found to be significantly different than those from the ground truth in most instances. Furthermore, the width functions and cumulative area relationships determined from the published DEMs were found to fall consistently outside the 90% confidence limits determined from the ground truth for more than 60% of the relationship, suggesting that these hydrologic properties are poorly estimated from published DEMs. However, the slope-area relationships determined from published DEMs were found to be less sensitive to catchment shape, size, and stream network, with the relationship falling outside the 90% confidence limits for less than 40% of the relationship for all catchments identified from the published DEMs. A published relationship linking the horizontal resolution with the vertical accuracy of the DEM was tested, predicting a horizontal resolution of about 10 m for the published DEMs tested.

AB Calibration is required for most soil moisture sensors if accurate measurements are to be obtained. This can be time consuming and costly, especially if field calibration is undertaken, but can be facilitated by a good understanding of the behaviour of the particular sensor being calibrated. We develop generalized temperature correction and soil water calibration relationships for Campbell Scientific CS615 water-content reflectometer sensors. The temperature correction is estimated as a function of the raw sensor measurement. The calibration relationship requires one soil-related parameter to be set. These relationships facilitate field calibration of these sensors to acceptable accuracies with only a small number of samples. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The Cienaga Grande of Santa Marta is Colombia's largest coastal wetland and one of the most important in the Caribbean. In this paper we evaluate the complex linkages existing among the social-ecological history, provision of ecosystem services and human well-being as perceived by local stakeholders. The most critical anthropogenic impacts occurred during the last 50 years in the period following the construction of the Cienaga-Barranquilla highway. The changes to the social-ecological system have severely altered hydrological dynamics, reduced mangrove forest coverage and affected the composition of fisheries, with direct and indirect effects on the ecosystem services provision and on the well-being of the local people. Despite the ambitious restoration programmes put in practice during the last two decades, the social-ecological impacts of large infrastructure developments are visible today. The paper offers insights that can improve environmental decision making and promote adaptive governance in coastal wetlands.

AB Numerical Monte Carlo simulation is considered to be one of the main tools to be used in groundwater hydrology (1) to quantify the uncertainty in the flow predictions due to imperfect knowledge of aquifer architecture, hydraulic parameters, and forcing terms or (2) to assess the reliability of approximated moment-based equations for flow and/or transport. While the Monte Carlo framework is conceptually straightforward and very flexible, it is recognized as lacking well-established convergence criteria. Here we propose a methodology for convergence analysis of Monte Carlo simulations and therefore for the reliability assessment of the inferred statistical moments. The methodology, based on simple rules of statistical inference, is described with reference to a typical groundwater flow problem and can be extended to different application fields.

AB An empirical power function model of V = kQ(m) has been used worldwide to describe the relationship between flow velocity (V, m s(-1)) and discharge rate (Q m(3) s(-1)) for rill and open channel flows. However, it has seldom been applied to watershed outlet channels taking into account the impacts of watershed size. In this study, observed data from four experimental watersheds of different sizes, ranging from about 1 to 100 km(2), were used to verify the stability of the power function model for use at a watershed level on the Loess Plateau. An alternative logarithmic function model of V = e ln Q + d was also tested. Results showed that the constant parameters in both model types were impacted by watershed size, which are inherently directly related to the size of the outlet channels. The constants k and d, which represent flow velocity for unit discharge rate, were negatively correlated with watershed size. However, the exponential constants m and e, which determine the rate of change in flow velocity with respect to discharge rate, were shown to be independent of watershed size. Furthermore, soil and water conservation land use management on the Loess Plateau was also shown to indirectly affect the flow velocity-discharge rate relationship in the smallest watersheds (1 km(2)). The study indicated that, although the performance of the logarithmic function model was acceptable, the power function model generally performed better over a larger range of flow velocity values and was better able to represent the flow velocity-discharge rate relationship in the unique context of the Loess Plateau.

AB We use field observations, laboratory experiments, and mathematical theory to characterize the full life cycle of a tributary-dammed lake. The natural lake formed in August 2007 at the confluence of the Laonong River, southern Taiwan, with a steep tributary. Due to heavy rains from typhoons Wutip and Sepat, the tributary delivered massive amounts of sediment to the confluence. This caused damming of the trunk river, the growth of a lake, and the demise of a bridge upstream of the confluence. The lake lasted until October 2007, gradually decaying due to incision and infill by subsequent stream flow. We reconstruct the episode using hydrological records, ground observations, and surveyed profiles. We then use the event to verify a mathematical theory of river and lake bed evolution. The theory is based on a diffusion description of river morphodynamics, constrained by backwater effects due to lake formation. After validation using laboratory experiments, the theory is applied to the Laonong field event. Good agreement is obtained between calculated and surveyed long profiles. The theory can also reproduce the complex stage hydrograph recorded upstream of the confluence. This suggests a role for simplified, but laboratory-tested mathematical theory in quantitative investigations of fluvial processes in the field.

DE PARAMETER ESTIMATION; INVERSE PROBLEM; NOISE; FILTER
AB This paper presents several methods which are based on multiple data sets to reduce the errors caused by the noise in the measured data. The comparisons show that the accuracy of inverse solution depends both on the noise level and on the number of consecutive observations. For low noise levels, both average and least squares methods perform well. When the noise level is high, integration methods based on the trapezoidal rule yield better accuracy. However, when noise dominates the record, all methods may yield an unacceptable error. To reduce noise levels, a Butterworth filter is used. Using filtered data, the accuracy of the estimated parameters is improved. A computed example shows that the errors in transmissivity and storage coefficient are different because they have different derivatives. Application of the inverse methods are demonstrated in a two-dimensional problem.

AB Recently, Hilhorst (2000) presented a theoretical model describing a linear relationship between bulk electrical conductivity, sigma(a), and dielectric constant, K-a, in moist soil. Hilhorst (2000) found that using this linear relationship, measurements of the pore water electrical conductivity, sigma(p), can be made in a wide range of soil types without soil-specific calibrations. If accurate measurements were to be made, only one parameter had to be optimized. In the present study, the linear model was evaluated using detailed time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements in coarse sand, medium sand and loamy sand. It was shown that the measured slope of the linear model was lower than expected. A reason for this might be that the K-a of the pore water is smaller than that of free water due to the presence of bound water. The results showed that the linear model was as good as other commonly used models for sigma(p) predictions.

AB A numerical model developed to simulate stable and unstable flows in unsaturated porous media is described. Results of numerical studies carried out to simulate laboratory experiments with the assumption of stable flow demonstrate the occurrence of unstable flow for the initial conditions of both air dry and field capacity for unsaturated infiltration in sands. This indicates that the Richards flow equation based on moisture content and potential variables averaged over total cross-sectional area may not be applicable for flow under instability-prone boundary conditions. The unstable flow due to wetting front instability is modelled using the steady-state theory proposed by Hillel & Baker (1988). Simulation results for fingered flux calculated with the theory represent the experimental data reasonably well. The pore water velocity remains constant irrespective of the incident flux as long as the flux is smaller than the hydraulic conductivity value at the water entry suction of the porous media. The effect of antecedent wetness on the unstable flow behaviour is to reduce the pore water velocity drastically from air dry to field capacity conditions.

AB Spatial and seasonal variations in CO(2) and CH(4) concentrations in streamwater and adjacent soils were studied at three sites on Brocky Burn, a headwater stream draining a peatland catchment in upland Britain. Concentrations of both gases in the soil atmosphere were significantly higher in peat and riparian soils than in mineral soils. Peat and riparian soil CO(2) concentrations varied seasonally, showing a positive correlation with air and soil temperature. Streamwater CO(2) concentrations at the upper sampling site, which mostly drained deep peats, varied from 2.8 to 9.8 mg l(-1) (2.5 to 11.9 times atmospheric saturation) and decreased markedly downstream. Temperature-related seasonal variations in peat and riparian soil CO(2) were reflected in the stream at the upper site, where 77% of biweekly variation was explained by an autoregressive model based on: (i) a negative log-linear relationship with stream flow; (ii) a positive linear relationship with soil CO(2) concentrations in the shallow riparian wells; and (iii) a negative linear relationship With soil CO(2) concentrations in the shallow peat wells, with a significant 2-week lag term. These relationships changed markedly downstream, with an apparent decrease in the soil-stream linkage and a switch to a positive relationship between stream flow and stream CO(2). Streamwater CH4 concentrations also declined sharply downstream, but were much lower (<0.01 to 0.12 mg l(-1)) than those of CO(2) and showed no seasonal variation, nor any relationship with soil atmospheric CH4 concentrations. However, stream CH4 was significantly correlated with stream flow at the upper site, which explained 57% of biweekly variations in dissolved concentrations. We conclude that stream CO(2) can be a useful integrative measure of whole catchment respiration, but only at sites where the soil-stream linkage is strong. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

TI Rainfall erosivity over the Calabrian region

DT Article
AB Following the results of a study carried out for the neighbouring Sicilian region, this paper reports a study of the applicability of the annual value, F-aj, of the Arnouldus index to represent the erosion risk in Calabrian region. Firstly, by using 214 values of the mean annual value of the erosivity index, F-F, and a Kriging interpolation method, an isoerosivity map is plotted. Then, in order to predict the erosion risk for an event of any return period, the probability distribution of the F-aj index is studied. An in situ statistical analysis, carried out by using candidate distributions with two parameters (Gauss, LN2, EV1 and Weibull distribution), showed that the EV1 and LN2 laws were characterized by the best fit to the empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) In order to establish the theoretical CDF to use as a regional parent distribution, the descriptive ability of the LN2 and EV1 distributions was also studied by a hierarchical regional procedure. Finally, the analysis showed that for each Calabrian sub-region, characterized by a constant value of the coefficient of variation, the erosion risk index was constant.

AB Relative baseflow volume and streamflow flashiness indices were used to assess relationships between land use/cover and streamflow regime in nine New Jersey (NJ) Pinelands streams. Baseflow index (BFI) and Richards-Baker flashiness index (RBI) were estimated on an October- September water year, with period-of-record changes assessed by trend analysis and differences between watersheds assessed by examining index versus land-use/cover relationships using a data period common to all study sites. Four streams, among the more urbanized watersheds of the nine study sites, were found to have significant (alpha = 0.05) trends in both indices. The two most urbanized study sites showed decreasing baseflow and increasing flashiness; however, the other two streams showed the opposite trends. An apparent slowdown in urbanization towards the second half of the streamflow period of record, along with potential changes in wetland agricultural practices in the latter two watersheds, may explain their trend results. A marginally significant (alpha = 0.10) decreasing relationship was found between mean annual BFI and wetland agriculture, whereas a significant (alpha = 0.05) increasing relationship was determined between mean annual RBI and artificial lakes/reservoirs. Principal component analysis showed an association between wetland agriculture and artificial lakes/reservoirs which suggested that both of the significant index versus land-use/cover relationships reflect wetland agricultural activities. Because these significant relationships involved land uses/covers with small spatial extents (<= 5%), they demonstrated that land-use practices can have a greater impact than spatial extent on stream hydrology. This study is the first step in assessing the effect on the NJ Pinelands stream ecology by streamflow alteration due to wetland agricultural activities. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   STORM RUNOFF; FOREST; ACIDIFICATION; SOIL; FLOW; GENERATION; BIRKENES
AB The observation that ''old'' water dominates storm runoff suggests that release of low-solute water from soils rather than rainwater must cause storm runoff dilution. This inference is supported by sprinkling experiments in an 860-m(2) catchment in the Oregon Coast Range, in which >200 mm of both high and low ionic strength precipitation produced similar concentration-discharge trends. Rainwater chemistry was buffered as it traveled through catchment soils: the amount of sprinkling-derived water in the runoff increased during long periods of steady discharge but was not accompanied by a change in runoff solute concentrations. Stored water plays a role in runoff dilution as well. Nearly al runoff from the catchment passes through underlying weathered bedrock rather than perching and discharging only through soil. Bedrock water composition appears to vary through storm events, as the average contact time of water with rock declines with increasing discharge, a behavior at odds with the concept of stable end-members.

AB A novel design of lysimeter for use in mires (peatlands) with shallow water tables is described. It employs an hydraulic mechanism for the automatic equilibration of soil moisture distribution between the outside and the inside of the lysimeter tank but uses no electronic components or electrical power; and it can be installed with minimal disturbance in surfaces with poor load-bearing capacity. The system was deployed on a mire in northern Scotland to investigate the distribution of shallow seepage associated with catenary arrays of different types of surface (microtopes). During the three-year period 15 November 1988 to 19 November 1991, the fraction of rainfall dispersed as seepage was 52% in a pool system; 62% in ridge-furrow microtopography; and 59-67% in unpatterned sloping mire. The data provide preliminary confirmation of the hypothesis of K. E. Ivanov that different microtopes within the same mire differ in their hydrological norms; and suggest that the range of ecohydrological differences at the study site may be similar to those obtained by Ivanov in western Siberia. Details of lysimeter design, construction, installation and operation are appended together with a discussion of the theory of the lysimeter.

AB Soil loss continues to threaten Java's predominantly bench-terraced volcanic uplands. Sediment transport processes on back-sloping terraces with well-aggregated clay-rich oxisols in West Java were studied using two different techniques. Splash on bare, cropped, or mulched sub-horizontal (2-3degrees) terrace beds was studied using splash cups of different sizes, whereas transport of sediment on the predominantly bare and steep (30-40degrees) terrace risers was measured using a novel device combining a Gerlach-type trough with a splash box to enable the separate measurement of transport by wash and splash processes. Measurements were made during two consecutive rainy seasons. The results were interpreted using a recently developed splash distribution theory and related to effective rainfall erosive energy. Splash transportability (i.e. transport per unit contour length and unit erosive energy) on the terrace risers was more than an order of magnitude greater than on bare terrace beds (0.39-0.57 versus 0.013-0.016 g m J(-1)). This was caused primarily by a greater average splash distance on the short, steep risers (> 11 cm versus c. 1 cm on the beds). Splashed amounts were reduced by the gradual formation of a protective `pavement' of coarser aggregates, in particular on the terrace beds. Soil aggregate size exhibited an inverse relationship with detachability (i.e. detachment per unit area and unit erosive energy) and average splash length, and therefore also with transportability, as did the degree of canopy and mulch cover. On the terrace risers, splash-creep and gravitational processes transported an additional 6-50% of measured rain splash, whereas transport by wash played a marginal role.

AB A framework for the prediction of solute spread in partially saturated heterogeneous porous formation is presented by combining a general Lagrangian formulation, relating the spatial moments of the solute body to the velocity field, with the stochastic theory of Yeh et al. (1985a, b) for steady unsaturated flow, relating the statistical moments of the velocity field to properties of the heterogenous formation. The relevant formation properties are log saturated conductivity, log K(s) and the pore size distribution parameter, alpha, which, in turn, are viewed as independent, random spatial functions. First-order approximations of the longitudinal and transverse components of the velocity covariance function are derived for unidirectional, vertical mean flow in partially saturated, heterogeneous porous formations of three-dimensional structure. Neglecting pore scale dispersion, and by using basic, kinematical relationships to relate the displacement to the velocity field, the effect of mean water saturation, and of statistical parameters of porous formation properties on longitudingal and transverse components of the time-dependent displacement covariance tensor X, is evaluated. Results of the analyses show that solute spread increases as water saturation decreases. In the case where the correlation scale of a was small, as compared with that of log K(s), however, the longitudinal component of X is essentially robust to water saturation, suggesting that in this case, vadose zone transport might be amenable to an analysis similar to that for saturated groundwater transport.

AB Channel networks artibtrary drainage density or resolution can be extracted from digital elevation data. However, for digital elevation data derived networks to be useful they have to be extracted at the correct length scale or drainage density. Here we suggest a criterion for determining the appropriate drainage density at which to extract networks from digital elevation data. The criterion is basically to extract the highest resolution (highest drainage density) network that satisfies scaling laws that have traditionally been found to hold for channel networks. Procedures that use this criterion are presented and tested on 21 digital elevation data sets well distributed throughout the U.S.

AB The spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity in a shallow unconfined aquifer located at North Bay, Ontario, composed of glacial-lacustrine and glacial-fluvial sands, is examined in exceptional detail and characterized geostatistically. A total of 1878 permeameter measurements were performed at 0.05 m vertical intervals along cores taken from 20 boreholes along two intersecting transect lines. Simultaneous three-dimensional (3-D) fitting of Ln(K) variogram data to an exponential model yielded geostatistical parameters for the estimation of bulk hydraulic conductivity and solute dispersion parameters. The analysis revealed a Ln(K) variance equal to about 2.0 and 3-D anisotropy of the correlation structure of the heterogeneity (lambda(1), lambda(2), and lambda(3) equal to 17.19, 7.39, and 1.0 m, respectively). Effective values of the hydraulic conductivity tensor and the value of the longitudinal macrodispersivity were calculated using the theoretical expressions of Gelhar and Axness (1983). The magnitude of the longitudinal macrodispersivity is reasonably consistent with the observed degree of longitudinal dispersion of the landfill plume along the principal path of migration. Variably saturated 3-D flow modeling using the statistically derived effective hydraulic conductivity tensor allowed a reasonably close prediction of the measured water table and the observed heads at various depths in an array of piezometers. Concomitant transport modeling using the calculated longitudinal macrodispersivity reasonably predicted the extent and migration rates of the observed contaminant plume that was monitored using a network of multilevel samplers over a period of about 5 years. It was further demonstrated that the length of the plume is relatively insensitive to the value of the longitudinal macrodispersivity under the conditions of a steady flow in 3-D and constant source strength. This study demonstrates that the use of statistically derived parameters based on stochastic theories results in reliable large-scale 3-D flow and transport models for complex hydrogeological systems. This is in agreement with the conclusions reached by Sudicky (1986) at the site of an elaborate tracer test conducted in the aquifer at the Canadian Forces Base Borden.

TI MODELING WATER EROSION DUE TO OVERLAND-FLOW USING PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES
   .1. SHEET FLOW
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID PLANE
AB A new model for erosion of plane soil surfaces by water is developed using physical principles. Raindrop impact and overland flow remove soil from the original cohesive soil. Once eroded soil enters overland flow, either as aggregates or primary particles, a significant proportion of it returns to the soil bed, forming a cohesionless deposited layer from which it can be removed again by the same erosion processes. The action of the eroding agents will be divided between eroding the unshielded original cohesive soil and reintroducing sediment from the deposited layer. The theory recognizes that the nature of the surface is modified by the erosion and deposition processes affecting it. Solutions of the governing differential equations describing sediment concentration are developed for two distinct equilibrium cases. The first case, when the deposited layer completely shields the original soil, appears to correspond with what has been previously called a "transport-limited" situation. The second case occurs when such shielding is incomplete, and sediment concentration is affected by the cohesive strength of the soil. The resulting equations for sediment concentration at equilibrium are compared with existing equations. Firstly, the equation for the case where the soil is lacking cohesion is shown to be similar to the semiempirical equation of Yang (1973). Secondly, when the soil is cohesive the slope length relationships are shown to be in good agreement with the universal soil loss equation over a wide range of slope steepness.

ID FRAMEWORK; CONFLICT
AB Education on the subject of groundwater is crucial for sustainability. Nevertheless, international studies with students across different age groups have shown that the basic hydrogeological concept of groundwater defined as water within porous and permeable rocks is not an established everyday notion. Drawing from international research, a multimedia learning program Zwischen Regenwolke und Wasserhahn (between the rain cloud and the tap) was developed, which incorporates specific insights from the fields of conceptual change research, multimedia research, and the model of educational reconstruction. The effectiveness of the learning program was ascertained by means of two studies with Austrian seventh grade pupils as well as teacher-training students from the fields of biology and geography in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the learning program. Using a quasi-experimental research design, the participants' conceptions and knowledge of groundwater were determined in a pre- and post-test. The pupils and students greatly benefitted from working through the learning software independently. Their knowledge of groundwater increased significantly compared to the control group and there was a highly significant increase in the number of scientifically correct notions of groundwater. The acceptance of the program was also generally very high. The results indicate that theory-guided multimedia learning programs can play an important role in the transfer of research results to classroom settings, especially in science education.

ID OPTIMIZATION; MODEL; MANAGEMENT
AB Reservoir system simulation models are widely used to determine a system's firm water yield, average yield, or hydropower capacity.  Most such models use heuristic guidelines to define the system's operating policy.  Alternatively, optimization can be used within the simulation to identify a reasonable operating strategy.  In this paper a theoretical justification is provided for several heuristic operating guidelines, including the widely used space rule.  The guidelines are expressed as a mathematical objective function and combined with constraints on system operation to yield one-period optimization submodels that can be used to determine releases within a simulation.  Use of these one-period optimization models improved the simulated operation of the Central Valley Project in California over the critical period of provided reasonable policies for other hydrologic scenarios.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT; MODELS
AB This paper introduces an early warning model for floods for real-time reservoir operation during typhoons. The model contains three main parts: (a) "flood watch" to monitor the current flood situation, (b) "flood release" to estimate probable reservoir releases in the near future, and (c) "decision analysis" to determine an appropriate release policy. A new flood alert index is defined to account for risk and is used to augment reservoir flood operation. In this study, a genetic algorithm-based rule is presented to specify suitable releases in response to the nature of flood inflows and reservoir water level. To demonstrate the procedure, the proposed method was successfully used in a real reservoir in northern Taiwan. The implementation of such a model proves that it can assist reservoir operators in taking timely action during typhoon events.

AB In order to calculate the transmissivity from the inverse problem corresponding to the groundwater flow in an isotropic horizontal aquifer, a numerical conservative approach is tested. The method deals with triangulation of the domain and applies the conservation of mass to elements of the mesh using the harmonic mean for internodal transmissivities. An optimal sweeping algorithm is used to evaluate nodal transmissivities from one element to another with a minimal relative error accumulation. The practical importance of the method is demonstrated through two synthetic examples representing those experienced in the field, then through application to a Moroccan aquifer. The computed hydraulic head is well fitted to the reference one, which confirms the validity of the identified transmissivity model.

AB The dependence of interception loss from different tropical tree canopies on rainfall type was investigated using a two-layer stochastic model that simulates all stages in the process of rainfall interception. The effect of different types of rainfall (drizzle, thunderstorm and widespread rain), was investigated using three power laws relating raindrop sizes to rainfall intensity.
   The study showed the importance of canopy characteristics in determining the stochastic wetting processes that explain the differences in interception loss between species. It also showed that predicted interception loss is relatively insensitive to raindrop size and also, therefore, to the choice of relationship between rainfall intensity and raindrop sizes used in the model. Any significant changes in interception loss resulting from climate change effects will therefore not be from changes in rainfall intensity (which affects drop size), but from any changes in storm sizes and frequency.

TI THE SIMULATION OF CHLORIDE INFLOWS INTO LAKE KINNERET
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB It is necessary to operate Lake Kinneret in the future according to revised policies. This has required development of a tool which permits a forecast of the effect of the revised operating rules on the quality and quantity of available water for direct consumption from the lake. For this purpose, a combined daily water and chloride inflow simulation model, M8KNRT, was developed. This paper presents a description of the model, which is based on the inverse relationship between water inflows to Lake Kinneret from saline springs and ground water, and their chloride contribution to the lake. This concept, implying that fresh aquifer heads and discharges regulate the brine fluxes, is the most important feature of the M8KNRT model. The excellent results achieved following calibration of the model based on simulation of water and chloride inflows to Lake Kinneret, and on chloride concentrations in the lake confirm its validity for use in future forecasts under different operating conditions within the lake watershed. The model is structured in general form, allowing it to be applied to any other lake with similar problems.

AB Flood-envelope curves (FECs) are useful for constraining the upper limit of possible flood discharges within drainage basins in a particular hydroclimatic region. Their usefulness, however, is limited by their lack of a well-defined recurrence interval. In this study we use radar-derived precipitation estimates to develop an alternative to the FEC method, i.e., the frequency-magnitude-area-curve (FMAC) method that incorporates recurrence intervals. The FMAC method is demonstrated in two well-studied US drainage basins, i.e., the Upper and Lower Colorado River basins (UCRB and LCRB, respectively), using Stage III Next-Generation-Radar (NEXRAD) gridded products and the diffusion-wave flow-routing algorithm. The FMAC method can be applied worldwide using any radar-derived precipitation estimates. In the FMAC method, idealized basins of similar contributing area are grouped together for frequency-magnitude analysis of precipitation intensity. These data are then routed through the idealized drainage basins of different contributing areas, using contributing-area-specific estimates for channel slope and channel width. Our results show that FMACs of precipitation discharge are power-law functions of contributing area with an average exponent of 0.82 +/- 0.06 for recurrence intervals from 10 to 500 years. We compare our FMACs to published FECs and find that for wet antecedent-moisture conditions, the 500-year FMAC of flood discharge in the UCRB is on par with the US FEC for contributing areas of similar to 10(2) to 10(3) km(2). FMACs of flood discharge for the LCRB exceed the published FEC for the LCRB for contributing areas in the range of similar to 10(3) to 10(4) km(2). The FMAC method retains the power of the FEC method for constraining flood hazards in basins that are ungauged or have short flood records, yet it has the added advantage that it includes recurrence-interval information necessary for estimating event probabilities.

   PARTITIONED SOLUTION METHOD
AB A simple and computationally effective partitioned solution procedure was used to solve the coupled equations of water flow in a variably-saturated dual-porosity medium. The coupled equations were first discretized in space and time using standard numerical solution procedures. The resulting algebraic system was subsequently partitioned in the time domain with a staggered implicit-implicit partitioning scheme. The partitioned time-integration procedures were carried out sequentially for the two subsystems, and coupled by temporal extrapolation techniques. A numerical stability and accuracy analysis demonstrated that the partitioned solution scheme, when integrated with the midpoint rule, is unconditionally stable and second-order accurate with only a single-pass through the partitioned equations (i.e. without iteration between the two subsystems). Simulation examples revealed that the solution of the single-pass scheme yields a slightly delayed response to that of the iterative scheme.

ID OPEN-CHANNEL FLOW
AB The main research objective consisted in analysing the influence of roughness caused by aquatic vegetation (av), in particular submerged macrophytes, on the overall flow field. These plants are highly flexible and behave differently depending on the flow situation. They also react substantially to the flow field and thus, the roughness becomes variable and dynamic. Conventional flow formulas, such as the Manning or the Strickler formula, are one-dimensional and based on integral flow parameters. They are not suitable for quantifying the roughness of av, because the flow is complex and more dimensional due to the variable behaviour of the plants. Therefore, the present investigation concentrates on the definition of a characteristic hydraulic roughness parameter, to quantify the resistance of av. Within this investigation laboratory experiments were carried out with three different types of av, chosen with respect to varying plant structures as well as stem lengths. Velocity measurements above these plants were conducted to determine the relationship between the hydraulic roughness and the deflected plant height. The deflected plant height is used as the geometric roughness parameter, whereas the equivalent sand roughness based on the universal logarithmic law modified by Nikuradse was used as hydraulic roughness parameter. The influence of relative submergence on the hydraulic roughness was also analysed. The analysis of the velocity measurements illustrates that equivalent sand roughness and zero plane displacement of the logarithmic law are correlated to the deflected plant height and are equally to this height.

   DETERMINATION; SOIL; CALIBRATION; CONSTANT; MOISTURE; ROCK
AB Measurements of the dielectric constant in regions of the subsurface are commonly made to determine water content and in turn to determine water saturation. The accuracy with which water content or saturation information can be obtained from dielectric data is very dependent upon the model used to relate dielectric constant to water content or saturation. Most models assume that the material can be described as a homogeneous mixture of solids and fluids. While this may be valid in the interpretation of laboratory data, we suggest that in the interpretation of field data, improved accuracy in water content and saturation estimates can be obtained by accounting for the presence of layering. We present three relationships for determining water content or saturation from dielectric constant for layered materials. These three layered averages take into account both the layer thickness and measurement direction. We numerically model the relationship between the dielectric constant and both the fine fraction and water content or saturation in sand-fine systems. We calculate dielectric constant as a function of water content or saturation using these three relationships for layered systems and compare the results to those calculated using two relationships for homogeneous systems. There are considerable differences between the dielectric constants predicted from the relationships for layered and homogeneous media. There are also differences between the individual relationships for the layered media due to the geometries of the systems. The numerical results illustrate the inaccuracy that can result in water content and especially saturation estimates if an inappropriate relationship is used to interpret dielectric data from a layered system.

They suggest that approximately half of the deforestation that has occurred over the long sweep of human history can be explained statistically in terms of population growth. It is cautioned, however, that serious conceptual and methodological problems confront the analysis of the relationship. It is also emphasized that the relationship is complex. Evidence is presented to show that it has changed through time, and that it is complicated by interactions between various factors operating in different ways at different levels.

AB An investigation has been carried out into the relationship between rainfall and African Easterly Wave (AEW) phase over the Bakoye River catchment in West Africa. Daily values of raingauge data and cold cloud duration (CCD) from satellite imagery, together with humidity and vertical velocity fields (from ECMWF model analyses) have been compared with dominant wave phase also obtained from ECMWF wind fields for three rainy seasons. The average results for this relatively small area agree with previous studies from GATE data for the southern part of the AEW region with strongest convection and rainfall in and ahead of the trough. Observations of rainfall and CCD ahead of the trough are consistent with a simple model of AEW structure, which requires sufficient low-level moisture to trigger convective rain ahead of the trough. There is some indication that the relationship between cold cloud duration and rainfall depends on wave phase. Analysis of storm types shows a higher frequency of active storms ahead of the trough with a minimum around the ridge.

DE SPATIAL WATER EQUIVALENT DISTRIBUTION; INTERPOLATION PROCEDURE;

AB We describe an objective method for evaluating the spatial distribution of water equivalents of the snow cover within a small catchment.  Regression analysis is used to quantify the relationship between elevation, presence or absence of forest, and potential direct solar radiation as independent variables and water equivalent as measured at a number of sites.  First, this regression relationship is used to interpolate water equivalent data all over the basin area.  Then we interpolate the residuals of the regression using a geostatistical approach.  Superimposing the results obtained by interpolating the regression relationship and the interpolated residuals eventually yields the water equivalent distribution over the test area.  The advantages of the interpolation method used lie in the optimal (effective, unbiased) estimation of the interpolated values as well as in the possibility to quantify the associated estimation variances.

ID MONTHLY MEAN CIRCULATION; UNITED-STATES; MONTHLY PRECIPITATION; HEIGHT
   FIELD; SPECIFICATION; CLIMATE
AB In this study, winter mean 700 mbar height anomalies over the eastern North Pacific Ocean and the western USA are related to variability in snowpack accumulations measured on or about 1 April at 21 snowcourse stations within and near the Gunnison River basin in Colorado. Results indicate that lower than normal snowpack accumulations are primarily associated with positive 700 mbar height anomalies (anomalous anticyclonic circulation) over the western USA. Moist air from the Pacific Ocean is moved to the north of the western USA along the western margin of the anomalous anticyclonic circulation. In contrast, higher than normal snowpack accumulations are associated with negative 700 mbar height anomalies (anomalous cyclonic circulation) over the western USA and over most of the eastern North Pacific Ocean. The anomalous cyclonic circulation over the western USA enhances the movement of moisture from the Pacific Ocean into the southern and central parts of the West.
   Results also indicate that variability in winter mean 700 mbar height anomalies can explain over 50% of the variability in snowpack accumulations in the Gunnison River basin. The significant linear relationships between 700 mbar height anomalies and snowpack accumulations in the Gunnison River basin can be used in conjunction with general circulation model simulations of 700 mbar height anomalies for future climatic conditions to estimate future snowpack accumulations in the Gunnison River basin.

ID CHANNEL NETWORK GROWTH; DISCHARGE; MASS
AB Spatial variability is a basic component of all natural systems. The system being studied here is the topography of an evolving drainage basin. Spatially heterogeneous erosivity within the drainage basin influences the structure of the drainage network, the roughness of small-scale features, and the overall appearance of the simulated topography. The presence of heterogeneities does not simply blur and smear analytical relationships. The heterogeneities themselves introduce new structure to the organization of the drainage Basin. Three measures, the slope-area relationship, the cumulative area relationship, and the hypsometric distribution, are all systematically affected by spatial heterogeneity. We will demonstrate how and why these relationships are affected and also how different structures in the heterogeneities themselves are manifested in the resulting simulated topography.

TI SEDIMENT SOURCE TRACING USING ENVIRONMENTAL MAGNETISM - A NEW APPROACH

SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
LA English
DT Article
DE ENVIRONMENTAL MAGNETISM; SEDIMENT TRACING; TESTING TRACER CONSTANCY
AB Environmental magnetism can be used for sediment source tracing in situations such as stream junctions where two catchments deliver magnetically distinguishable, well combined average source mixes to a trunk stream. Consistent mineral magnetic parameter relationships show that spatially and temporally constant magnetic mineral assemblages occur along reaches of natural streams. For most of the confluence mixing situations examined it is possible to distinguish between tributaries using magnetic parameter relationships. Using these relationships, relative tributary contributions to the resultant downstream mix can be quantified. The method can be used for tracing suspended and bedload sediments so that the principal source catchments can be determined by a sequence of measurements at stream junctions along a drainage network. There is considerable potential for using this new and easily applied method for studies of sediment delivery processes and sediment movement in fluvial environments.

In particular, the three-dimensional soil-water flow occurring with many of these measurement techniques is considered.  Complicating factors of soil heterogeneity, soil swelling and shrinking, and soil aggregation, that limit the interpretation of field measurements using classical theory, are discussed.

TI Examining the relationship between intermediate-scale soil moisture and

AB Interactions between soil moisture and terrestrial evaporation affect water cycle behaviour and responses between the land surface and the atmosphere across scales. With strong heterogeneities at the land surface, the inherent spatial variability in soil moisture makes its representation via point-scale measurements challenging, resulting in scale mismatch when compared to coarser-resolution satellite-based soil moisture or evaporation estimates. The Cosmic Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) was developed to address such issues in the measurement and representation of soil moisture at intermediate scales. Here, we present a study to assess the utility of CRNP soil moisture observations in validating model evaporation estimates. The CRNP soil moisture product from a pasture in the semi-arid central west region of New South Wales, Australia, was compared to evaporation derived from three distinct approaches, including the Priestley-Taylor (PT-JPL), Penman-Monteith (PM-Mu), and Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) models, driven by forcing data from local meteorological station data and remote sensing retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Pearson's correlations, quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the temporal distributions of soil moisture and evaporation over the study site. The relationships were examined against nearly 2 years of observation data, as well as for different seasons and for defined periods of analysis. Results highlight that while direct correlations of raw data were not particularly instructive, the Q-Q plots and ANOVA illustrate that the root-zone soil moisture represented by the CRNP measurements and the modelled evaporation estimates reflect similar distributions under most meteorological conditions. The PT-JPL and PM-Mu model estimates performed contrary to expectation when high soil moisture and cold temperatures were present, while SEBS model estimates displayed a disconnect from the soil moisture distribution in summers with long dry spells. Importantly, no single evaporation model matched the statistical distribution of the measured soil moisture for the entire period, highlighting the challenges in effectively capturing evaporative flux response within changing landscapes. One of the outcomes of this work is that the analysis points to the feasibility of using intermediate-scale soil moisture measurements to evaluate gridded estimates of evaporation, exploiting the independent, yet physically linked nature of these hydrological variables.

AB Thresholds in terrestrial water storage were quantified to explain differences in observed rainfall-runoff relationships for a 71.5 ha research catchment in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Using terrain analysis techniques, the catchment was partitioned into discrete hydrologic response units (HRUs). Unsaturated and saturated water storage was calculated for depression and midslope HRUs using continuous hydrometric measurements and a depth function for drainable porosity. The relationship between total water storage in these HRUs and catchment discharge was then examined for evidence of threshold behaviour. Piecewise regression analysis (PRA) was used to quantify a breakpoint in the nonlinear storage-discharge relationship, with separate linear regressions explaining the change in discharge with storage above and below this value. Above the breakpoint, a large increase in discharge is associated with a small increase in storage. Our results show that event-scale hydrologic response displays a threshold relationship with antecedent storage and maximum event storage in the terminal depression in the catchment. Our results also suggest that predictions of event runoff improve when storage excesses from upslope depressions are explicitly routed through the catchment taking into consideration storage deficits in downslope HRUs that may impede flow. The application of landscape delineation, hydrometric monitoring and PRA to model S-Q relationships is demonstrated to be an objective means of quantifying the transition between the two distinct hydrologic regimes in this catchment and provides new insight into how S-Q dynamics govern the hydrologic functioning of bedrock-dominated catchments.

TI STORAGE REQUIRED TO AUGMENT LOW FLOWS - A REGIONAL STUDY
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB An attempt has been made to provide a basis on which the amounts of deficit storage occurring in the natural hydrographs of small catchments can be estimated as a function of yield and the frequency of occurrence. The yield levels envisaged constitute only small proportions of the mean flow and the deficits arise due to seasonal fluctuations only. It is presumed that any deficits built up during the dry periods of the year are made up by the winter flows, so that there is no year to year carry over. The streamflow data of 26 catchments in Ireland are analysed to obtain the series of annual maxima storages on each catchment. Assuming that they are distributed according to the extreme value type 1 distribution, the relationship between the deficit storage and its frequency of occurrence is calculated for various levels of yield on each catchment. A simple model is described which expresses this relationship in terms of a few parameters. For use on ungauged catchments, those parameters are related to the physical characteristics of the catchments by multiple linear regression.

   limnological model of water reservoir; thermal stratification of water
AB In water reservoirs (lakes) in the summer period, three layers can be observed: the epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion. In summer an increase in the thickness of the epilimnion layer is observed together with a movement of the metalimnion towards the bottom and a significant increase in the temperature of the two layers. An increase in hypolimnion temperature is observed in autumn during the cooling of the surface layers of the water. The increase in temperature of the epilimnion and metalimnion in summer and the downward movement of the metalimnion has not been clearly explained. The movement of the metalimnion is connected with thermal energy transfer, but previous theories do not take into account the phenomenon observed. In this paper, a new theory of thermal energy transfer in water reservoirs is elaborated and subsequently checked by laboratory experiments. A physical model of the water reservoir was designed and constructed. During the investigations it was noted that thermal energy can be transferred towards the bottom of the reservoir due to the existence of anti-convectional currents, which appear with the water temperature inversion in the upper part of the water column. The results obtained in the laboratory were confirmed by measurements in the Salina Reservoir in Poland.

AB Geostatistical theory has shown promise in dealing with issues of stability, uniqueness, and identity of estimates inherent in inverse problems of subsurface flow. Here the geostatistical method is extended to three-dimensional, unsteady flow in variably saturated porous geological media (the vadose zone) that are modeled using the Richards equation and the van Genuchten-Mualem constitutive equations. The saturated hydraulic conductivity, alpha, and n parameters of this relationship are treated as spatially correlated, statistically independent, stochastic processes for representing heterogeneity of porous media. For given covariance functions of the parameters the adjoint-state sensitivity method is used to calculate first-order approximations for covariances of capillary pressure and moisture content and cross covariances between capillary pressure, moisture content, and the hydraulic properties. These covariances and cross covariances are then used in a successive linear estimator (SLE) to estimate the conditional means of the heterogeneous hydraulic property fields based on measurements of pressure and moisture content data. A sequential conditioning approach for our SLE was also applied to data sets collected at different sampling times during a transient infiltration event. This approach has the benefit of reducing the size of the matrices and so helps avoid numerical stability problems. On the basis of our study, pressure and moisture content data sets collected at later times of an infiltration event or during steady state flow were found to provide better estimates (smaller mean-square error compared to the true field) of the hydrological parameters of the vadose zone than data from very early times.

AB A one-dimensional diffusion model was used to investigate the effects of dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zone dissolution and remediation on the storage and release of contaminants from aquitards. Source zone dissolution was represented by a power law source depletion model, which served as a time variable boundary condition to the diffusion equation used to describe mass transport in the aquitard. Two key variables were used to assess source zone dissolution behavior on aquitard mass storage and release: the power law exponential term G, which reflects the influence of the source zone architecture, and a new variable defined herein as the source to aquitard mass transfer coefficient beta, which reflects the influences of both the source characteristics and the aquitard media properties. As G increased or as beta increased because of more rapid source dissolution, the aquitard concentrations, depth of penetration, and long-term back-diffusion flux decreased. However, when beta increased because of increased sorption, concentrations and back diffusion increased but penetration decreased. The duration of aquitard mass loading was found to be significantly less than the duration of mass release. Moreover, the mass per unit area stored in the aquitard was 3 or more orders of magnitude less than the initial DNAPL source zone mass per unit area, and the back diffusion flux from the aquitard was typically 4 or more orders of magnitude less than the initial source zone flux. Additionally, the effects of partial source zone remediation were investigated, and the results suggest that source remediation can have a favorable effect on long-term back-diffusion risk.

TI Methods for predicting peak discharge of floods caused by failure of
   natural and constructed earthen dams
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID OUTBURST FLOODS; LAKE; MAGNITUDE; DRAINAGE
AB Floods from failures of natural and constructed darns constitute a widespread hazard to people and property. Expeditious means of assessing hood hazards are necessary, particularly in the case of natural dams, which may form suddenly and unexpectedly. We revise statistical relations (derived from data for past constructed and natural dam failures) between peak discharge (Q(p)) and water volume released (V-0) or drop in lake level (d) but assert that such relations, even when cast into a dimensionless form, are of limited utility because they fail to portray the effect of breach-formation rate. We then analyze a simple, physically based model of dam-breach formation to show that the hydrograph at the breach depends primarily on a dimensionless parameter eta = kV(0)/g(1/2)d(7/2), where k is the mean erosion rate of the breach and g is acceleration due to gravity. The functional relationship between Q(p) and eta takes asymptotically distinct forms depending on whether eta less than or equal to 1 (relatively slow breach formation or small lake volume) or eta much greater than 1 (relatively fast breach formation or large lake volume). Theoretical predictions agree well with data from dam failures for which k, and thus eta, can be estimated. The theory thus provides a rapid means of predicting the plausible range of values of peak discharge at the breach in an earthen dam as long as the impounded water volume and the water depth at the dam face can be estimated.

AB Although water storage is an important variable to understand the hydrological functioning of a catchment, it is challenging to estimate the total water storage in a catchment. Catchment water storage can be estimated on the basis of water balance, but this approach is prone to errors in the different water balance terms. Here, an approach is presented to estimate the daily dynamics of catchment-wide soil water and groundwater storage on the basis of groundwater-level observations, soil properties and an assumption of hydrological equilibrium above the water table. This approach was applied to a 6300-m2 till catchment in Southwest Sweden. The predicted mean catchment water storage between April 1991 and June 1992 was 210mm and ranged from 190 to 260mm. The estimated water storage followed runoff rates closely especially during recession periods. On average, 79% of the water storage was held in the unsaturated zone, and the remaining 21% was groundwater, but this proportion varied strongly with runoff and total storage. During dry conditions, unsaturated storage accounted for at maximum 95% of the water storage; during wet conditions, this number dropped to 40%. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; MARSH
AB Estimates of transpiration are often needed for hydrological management in wetlands. A new and simple method, using a portable steady-state porometer, is presented for estimating transpiration in three aquatic emergent macrophytes (reed, cut-sedge, and cattail). The method was established on the basis of the relationships between transpiration, solar radiation, relative humidity and air temperature. By assessing relationships between all variables in piecewise linear regressions with breakpoint, water loss by transpiration can be estimated. The regression equations are calculated from direct observations including daily averages of climatic variables. Other data used in the model are area-defined leaf density of macrophytes and yearly macrophyte cover. The results of this method in comparison with literature transpiration data confirm the importance of transpiration in the water balance in aquatic ecosystems. The advantage of this method relies on the possibility to determine the physiological variability of transpiration in relation to climatic variables determined in situ. This permits a closer approximation of processes taking place in nature. Given that the required information is easily obtainable and that good estimates of transpiration in emergent macrophytes are provided, the method serves as a valuable tool for wetland hydrology management.

AB Deuterium and oxygen- 18 were used as natural tracers to investigate the hydraulic relationship between the Columbia River and the Blue Lake gravel aquifer near Portland, Oregon. A time series of stable-isotope data collected from surface and ground waters during a March 1990 aquifer test confirms that the river and aquifer are hydraulically connected. Calculations based on simple mixing show that the river contributed 40-50% of the yield of three wells after 5-6 days of pumping. Data collected during August 1990, show that the river contributed 65-80% of the yield of one well after 22 days of pumping and indicate that the contribution of the river was still increasing.

AB Hydrological and soil loss data have been collected since 1937 at the USDA-ARS Grassland Soil and Water Research Laboratory near Riesel, TX. Data from the site, originally named the Blacklands Experimental Watershed, have played a vital role in the evaluation of conservation management practices to limit soil erosion and off site herbicide transport and in the development of several watershed models used worldwide. The entire record of precipitation, runoff, sediment toss, management practices, and limited meteorological information is publicly available (http://www.ars.usda.gov/spa/hydro-data). The data represent a valuable regional resource for use in water supply modeling, rural land development, and agricultural land management. Results of the present analyses confirmed the importance of soil-water phases to temporal runoff patterns in the Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion. Little runoff occurs in the "dry" soil-water phase (avg. = 2-9 mm/month), but substantial surface runoff and lateral subsurface return flow occurs in the "saturated" phase (avg. = 19-28 mm/month). Strong linear relationships (P < 0.0001) were determined between watershed size and annual peak flow rates for return intervals from 2 to 100 yr. Long-term data indicate a drastic reduction in soil loss from small grain production compared to row crop production due to the presence of soil cover in both the spring and fall high precipitation periods. Thus, utilization of a winter cover crop in row crop production or conversion from row crop to small grain production can be effective in reducing offsite transport of sediment and associated contaminants, which may be important in watersheds with substantial agricultural contribution to water quality impairment.

AB Soil hydraulic conductivity (K) varies greatly with matric potential (h) and exhibits a high variability at the field scale. However, this key property for estimating water flux in soils is difficult to measure. In contrast, soil electrical conductivity (sigma) is easier to measure and is influenced by the same parameters affecting K. We derive a simple relationship between sigma and K(h) and test it against laboratory and literature data. Importantly, we show that parameters of this sigma-K(h) relationship can be completely determined with accessible measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity, electrical conductivity of the soil solution, and clay content. This results in K(h) estimation with a RMSE ranging between 0.4 and 0.5 for log K, i.e., of the order of most experimental determinations of K. A further test of the sigma-K(h) relationship on the large UNSODA hydraulic database shows good agreement and the robustness of the relationship. Such a relation could be useful in the spatial monitoring of water fluxes at the field scale using electrical resistivity tomography if the sigma(h) relationship can be obtained.

AB Extension of reactive transport modeling to predict the coupled thermal, hydrological, and chemical evolution of complex geological systems is predicated on successful application of the approach to simulate well-constrained physical experiments. In this study, steady-state effluent concentrations and dissolution/precipitation features associated with crushed quartz and tuff dissolution at 240 degrees C have been determined experimentally using a plug-flow reactor (PFR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques, then modeled with the reactive transport simulator GIMRT (Steefel and Yabusaki, 1996) using a linear rate law from transition State theory (TST). For quartz dissolution, interdependence of the specific surface area (A(m)) and reaction rate constant (k(m)) predicted from the modeling agrees closely with that obtained from an analytical solution to the reaction-transport equation without diffusion/dispersion, verifying the advection-dominant nature of the PFR experiments. Independently-determined A(qtz) and k(qtz) from the literature are shown to be internally consistent with respect to the model and analytical interdependence, implying appropriateness of the linear TST rate law and adequacy of BET-determined A, for use in modeling PFR experiments. Applications of this integrated approach for monomineralic dissolution include assessment of internal consistency among independent A(m) and k(m) data, estimation of k(m) from BET-determined A(m), and rapid evaluation of alternative rate laws. For such dissolution, accurate simulation of the experimental steady-state effluent concentrations (to within 3% for Na, Al and K; to within 15% for Si and Ca) and dearth of alteration phases (<1 vol.% in the model) defines minimum supersaturation thresholds for nucleation of primary minerals (to suppress their secondary precipitation) and the (non-unique) relative k(m) of hydrous aluminosilicates. For such multicomponent, multiphase experiments, reactive transport simulators provide the only practical means of estimating and constraining these kinetic parameters. Despite the approximations and uncertainties inherent in present-day models, close agreement between the experimental and simulation results reported herein provides an important measure of confidence for extending the modeling approach to address increasingly complex systems for which development of experimental analogs is impractical or impossible.

AB Peat is a highly compressible medium and changes in peat surface level in response to shifts in water storage and entrapped gas volume have been reported previously. Since both peat compressibility and capacity to entrap gas are related to peat structure, we hypothesize that the relationship between water table and surface level may vary across a peatland. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationships between peat surface level positions, water table positions and subsurface gas pools at local topographic low-lying areas within a poor fen, which differ in peat properties and vegetation cover. Three sites were investigated, two with highly movable surfaces (FA and FB) and one which was more stable (NF). Deviations from the water table position-surface level position relationship (residuals) appear to be related to changes in atmospheric pressure. However, this relationship varied between FA and NF. The differences in these relationships were supported by distinct patterns of gas dynamics between these sites. Ebullition tended to occur only during periods of falling atmospheric pressure at FA, whereas it occurred much more frequently at NF without atmospheric pressure being the primary control. Evidence of ebullition based on changes in volumetric water content below the water table were supported by ebullition measured by surface gas traps and by shifts in pore water pressure deviation. These different responses of surface level fluctuations to changes in atmospheric pressure between sampling locations are likely related to variations in peat properties between the sites.

TI Transport and retention from single to multiple fractures in crystalline

   retention model
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID DIFFUSION; TRACERS; MATRIX
AB Hydrogeologic characterization of crystalline rock formations on the field scale is important for many applications but still presents a multitude of challenges. In this work we use comprehensive hydrostructural information and present a detailed simulation study of flow and advective transport in a discrete fracture network (DFN) that replicates the Tracer Retention Understanding Experiments (TRUE) Block Scale rock volume at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden). Simulated water residence time tau and hydrodynamic retention parameter beta are used as independent constraints for estimating material retention properties as presented in paper 1 of this series, whereas simulated mean water residence times are compared with observed values. We find that the DFN simulations reproduce water residence times reasonably well, indicating that the characterization data are sufficient and that the DFN model does capture dominant features of the flow paths analyzed. The empirical quadratic law that relates aperture and transmissivity seems to better reproduce calibrated mean water residence times than the theoretical cubic law for the five flow paths. The active specific surface area (beta/tau) [1/L] as inferred from simulations is used for defining a generic retention model for the dominant rock type (Aspo diorite) that matches fairly well the entire range of calibrated retention parameters of the TRUE tests. The combination of paper 1 and this work provides a general, comprehensive methodology for evaluating tracer test results in crystalline rock where a comparable amount of information is available; critical to this methodology is that tracer tests are carried out using tracers with sufficiently different sorption affinities (of factor 10-100).

The Engelund equation has been selected for scrutiny since, although it accords well with experimental data in general, it has limitations under conditions of high bed load transport rates.

TI Rediscovering Robert E. Horton's lake evaporation formulae: new
   directions for evaporation physics
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID OPEN-WATER; SURFACE
AB Evaporation from open water is among the most rigorously studied problems in hydrology. Robert E. Horton, unbeknownst to most investigators on the subject, studied it in great detail by conducting experiments and heuristically relating his observations to physical laws. His work furthered known theories of lake evaporation, but it appears that it was dismissed as simply empirical. This is unfortunate because Horton's century-old insights on the topic, which we summarize here, seem relevant for contemporary climate-changeera problems. In rediscovering his overlooked lake evaporation works, in this paper we (1) examine several of his publications in the period 1915-1944 and identify his theory sources for evaporation physics among scientists of the late 1800s, (2) illustrate his lake evaporation formulae, which require several equations, tables, thresholds, and conditions based on physical factors and assumptions, and (3) assess his evaporation results over the continental U.S. and analyze the performance of his formula in a subarctic Canadian catchment by comparing it with five other calibrated (aerodynamic and mass transfer) evaporation formulae of varying complexity. We find that Horton's method, due to its unique variable vapor pressure deficit (VVPD) term, outperforms all other methods by similar to 3 %-15 % of R-2 consistently across timescales (days to months) and at an order of magnitude higher at sub-daily scales (we assessed up to 30 min) Surprisingly, when his method uses input vapor pressure disaggregated from reanalysis data, it still outperforms other methods which use local measurements. This indicates that the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) term currently used in all other evaporation methods is not as good an independent control for lake evap- oration as Horton's VVPD. Therefore, Horton's evaporation formula is held to be a major improvement in lake evaporation theory which, in part, may (A) supplant or improve existing evaporation formulae, including the aerodynamic part of the combination (Penman) method, (B) point to new directions in lake evaporation physics, as it leads to a "constant" and a nondimensional ratio (the former is due to Horton, John Dalton (1802), and Gustav Schubler (1831) and the latter to Jozef Stefan (1881) and Horton), and (C) offer better insights behind the physics of the evaporation paradox (i.e., globally, decreasing trends in pan evaporation are unanimously observed, while the opposite is expected due to global warming). Curiously, Horton's rare observations of convective vapor plumes from lakes may also help to explain the mythical origins of the Greek deity Venus and the dancing Nereids.

AB It has been shown by Neuman [1990], Di Federico and Neuman [ 1997], and Di Federico et al. [1999] that the power variogram of a statistically isotropic or anisotropic fractal field can be constructed as a weighted integral from zero to infinity of exponential or Gaussian variograms of overlapping, homogeneous random fields (modes) having mutually uncorrelated increments and variance proportional to a power 2H of the integral (spatial correlation) scale where H is the Hurst coefficient. Low- and high-frequency cutoffs are related to length scales of the sampling window (domain) and data support (sample volume), respectively. Intermediate cutoffs account for lacunarity due to gaps in the multiscale hierarchy, created by a hiatus of modes associated with discrete ranges of scales. Alternative mathematical representations of multimodal spatial variability were formulated by various authors in which space is filled by a discrete number of juxtaposed (mutually exclusive) materials or categories, each having its own architecture and attributes. The spatial distribution of categories is characterized by indicator random variables and their attributes by random fields. This paper focuses on expressions developed by Lu and Zhang [2002] in which the indicator variables and their attributes are mutually uncorrelated while each is autocorrelated and cross correlated within and between categories. Upon rewriting their expressions for statistically homogeneous and anisotropic media, it is demonstrated mathematically that in the limit as the categories stretch to occupy each point in space (overlap) in a way that preserves their local architecture, their attributes become mutually uncorrelated. Categories are said to overlap if they are found in fixed proportions within a representative sampling volume centered about any mathematical point throughout space; the idea is analogous to the well-known dual continuum concept in which two categories, most commonly fractures and porous blocks, are considered to overlap. In reality, the categories do not overlap but are considered to preserve their relative architectural arrangement throughout space. The variogram of an attribute, sampled jointly over overlapping statistically homogeneous and anisotropic categories, is the sum of the variograms of statistically homogeneous and anisotropic components of this attribute sampled over individual categories, weighted by their volumetric proportions. It is further demonstrated that when the overlapping categories represent an infinite or truncated hierarchy of modes whose attributes have exponential or Gaussian variograms, such that the product of category probability density function (pdf) and attribute variance is proportional to a power 2H + 1 of the attribute integral scale, they represent a fractal field characterized by a power or truncated power variogram as in the work of Di Federico and Neuman. Any category pdf that satisfies this condition, and any attribute pdf having a variance that satisfies the same condition, are admissible; neither of them need to be Gaussian (to form fractional Brownian motion) or Levy-like (to approximate fractional Levy motion) for the attribute to form a random fractal. Intermediate cutoffs render the latter model discrete, as is that of Lu and Zhang. Hence the two multimodal models are mutually consistent and complementary.

AB A simulation experiment is used to test the stochastic theory of unsaturated flow proposed by Mantoglou and Gelhar (1987a, b, c).  Tension means and variances derived from this theory are compared to tension distributions obtained from a detailed three-dimensional model developed by Ababou (1988).  The synthetically generated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions used in the detailed model vary significantly over relatively small distances.  Results from a simulated infiltration event indicate that the stochastic theory's predictions reproduce the overall trend of the heterogeneous tension distribution.  Deviations from the predicted mean generally lie within confidence intervals derived from the predicted variance.  The stochastic theory predicts less vertical moisture movement and somewhat more horizontal spreading than a comparable deterministic analysis.  This reflects the fact that the effective hydraulic conductivity function used in the stochastic approach is anisotropic.  The magnitude of this anisotropy increases with increasing tension.

AB The second stage of evaporation from a bare soil has been described in terms of the desorptivity, a parameter related to the soil's hydraulic properties.  Several formulas for desorptivity dependence on the soil water diffusivity have been proposed, but to date have not achieved the accuracy established for the sorptivity (i.e., <1% absolute relative error), the equivalent parameter for infiltration.  A new formula is derived in the present study using a weighted residual approach.  Comparison with precise numerical solutions for exponential and power law diffusivity functions shows that the new result has an absolute relative error less than 1%.

AB An approximate yet general approach for describing the overall behavior of water supply systems dominated by carry-over storage is introduced. Generalized relationships among reservoir system storage, yield, reliability, and resilience are introduced for water supply systems fed by autoregressive normal and lognormal annual inflows. Relationships for reservoir system resilience are derived which represent the likelihood that a system will recover from a failure, once a failure has occurred. Monte Carlo experiments document that a two-state Markov model can reproduce the relationships between resilience and reliability for a wide class of water supply systems. A two-state Markov model combined with some existing analytical relationships among storage, reliability, and yield provides a very general theoretical foundation for understanding the trade-offs among reservoir system storage, yield, reliability, and resilience.

AB A macroscopic form of Ohm's law is obtained for isotropic porous media saturated with an electrically conductive fluid by using volumetric averaging concepts. Closure of the macroscopic charge transport equation is aided by approximative modelling of the average geometric structures of three different types of isotropic porous media, namely foamlike materials, granular media and crossflow over prismatic bundles. Modelling of the microscopic charge transport necessitated the introduction of a representative interstitial flux of charge carriers and required quantification of the geometric tortuosity applicable to transport phenomena in general.

TI Theory of single-well tests in acute fracture-wellbore systems
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This study aims at establishing an understanding of the influence of the (fracture-wellbore) system intersection angle on various predictions made through single-well tests and developing mathematical models which can reproduce the responses of acute systems to various forms of disturbances under different conditions. The differential equation governing flow in conceptualized acute systems is derived from basic principles. Analytical solutions to this equation are reached for both transient and steady constant-flux test conditions. The potential theory is utilized to delineate the flow network and the zone of influence in acute systems during tests under initially non-uniform head conditions. The likelihood of non-linear how regime and its influence on the observed head changes and hence the aperture (or permeability) predictions are addressed and a general formulation is introduced. An overall discussion for the proposed models also addresses the natural extension of the basic concepts to refine estimates of other well test models.
   Major observations of practical significance include: (a) permeability of a hydraulically effective fracture is misjudged whenever an acute system is reduced to an orthogonal or a Vertical system configuration and (b) efficiency of production wells is largely affected from the angle of intersection, the fracture(s) dominating flow forms with the wellbore.

TI A preliminary investigation on the scaling behaviour of rainfall
   observed in two different climates
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES

ID MULTIFRACTAL ANALYSIS
AB The problem of transformation of rainfall data from one scale to another has been gaining considerable importance in recent years. Though the application of the concept of fractal theory, in the studies conducted thus far, nearly unanimously points at the possibility of such a transformation, the suitability of the theory to the highly variable rainfall in time and space has very often been questioned. A preliminary attempt is made herein to address this issue by investigating the existence of temporal scaling behaviour in rainfall data observed in two different climatic regions: (a) a subtropical climatic region (Leaf River basin, Mississippi, USA) and (b) an equatorial climatic region (Singapore). Rainfall data of three different resolutions, six-hourly, daily, and weekly, observed over a period of 25 years, are investigated. A mono- or simple-scaling method (box dimension method) is employed. The results achieved for the different data sets clearly indicate the existence of temporal scaling in rainfall observed in the two regions, an encouraging news on the suitability of fractal theory in understanding and modelling the rainfall process. However, the insufficiency of a single dimension to characterize the rainfall behaviour is realized, as the dimension depends on the rainfall intensity level, which, in turn, may be related to the rainfall generating mechanisms. A comparison of the box-dimension results obtained for data of different resolutions, from each of the regions, seems to indicate a possible connection between them, a prospect of tremendous practical importance. Another interesting observation is the similarity between the box dimension results obtained for rainfall data from Leaf River basin and Singapore, but this is also clearly related to the intensity level. The dependence of the dimension on the intensity threshold suggests the use of a multi-dimensional fractal approach, where the process is characterized by more than one dimension (or a dimension function) instead of one single dimension. On the basis of the present results, some potential areas for further study are identified.

AB Expressions for the upwelling and downwelling fluxes of optical and thermal radiation between soil, vegetation and the sky are derived, under certain simple assumptions. These are that interception of radiation by the vegetation is a purely geometric effect, while scattering is isotropic, with a strength given by a single-scattering albedo in the optical part of the spectrum, and by Kirchoff's Law in the thermal. The soil is assumed to be a lambertian reflector, also scattering according to an albedo and Kirchoff's Law. The model, called RM, conserves energy exactly. As part of a SVAT, it is driven by measured insolation instead of net radiation, with little increase in computational cost and number of parameters.

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

ID RIPARIAN VEGETATION; STREAM TEMPERATURE; OREGON; RESTORATION; REGIME;
   BASIN
AB We investigate relationships between environmental governance and water quality in two adjacent growing metropolitan areas in the western US. While the Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington metro areas share many common biophysical characteristics, they have different land development histories and water governance structures, providing a unique opportunity for examining how differences in governance might affect environmental quality. We conceptualize possible linkages in which water quality influences governance directly, using monitoring efforts as a metric, and indirectly by using the change in the sale price of single-family residential properties. Governance may then influence water quality directly through riparian restoration resulting from monitoring results and indirectly through land use policy. We investigate evidence to substantiate these linkages. Our results showed that changes in monitoring regimes and land development patterns differed in response to differences in growth management policy and environmental governance systems. Our results also showed similarities in environmental quality responses to varying governance systems. For example, we found that sales prices responded positively to improved water quality (e.g., increases in DO and reductions in bacteria counts) in both cities. Furthermore, riparian restoration efforts improved over time for both cities, indicating the positive effect of governance on this land-based resource that may result in improved water quality. However, as of yet, there were no substantial differences across study areas in water temperature over time, despite an expansion of these urban areas of more than 20% over 24 years. The mechanisms by which water quality was maintained was similar in the sense that both cities benefited from riparian restoration, but different in the sense that Portland benefited indirectly from land use policy. A combination of long-term legacy effects of land development, and a relatively short history of riparian restoration in both the Portland and Vancouver regions, may have masked any subtle differences between study areas. An alternative explanation is that both cities exhibited combinations of positive indirect and direct water quality governance that resulted in maintenance of water quality in the face of increased urban growth. These findings suggest that a much longer-term water quality monitoring effort is needed to identify the effectiveness of alternative land development and water governance policies.

AB The effects of investigator-dependent configuration and calibration procedures on model predictions are difficult to evaluate when sufficient data for model testing are not available.  We derived a set of rules and algorithms (referred to as input mapping) to provide consistent inputs for the Integrated Lake Watershed Acidification Study (ILWAS), Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC), and Enhanced Trickle Down (ETD) watershed acidification models without calibration.  Model predictions of lake chemistry based on input mapping were similar for two dissimilar northeast U.S. watersheds, and were within the variability obtained with independent calibration of the three models and the interannual variability observed in two studies of natural watersheds.  In a companion paper (Rose et al., this issue), Monte Carlo analysis is used, in conjunction with input mapping, to compare model predictions under varying inputs.

TI Effect of compressibility on the rise velocity of an air bubble in
   porous media
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The objective of this study is to develop a theoretical model to analyze the effect of air compressibility on air bubble migration in porous media. The model is obtained by combining the Newton's second law of motion and the ideal gas law assuming that the air phase in the bubble behaves as an ideal gas. Numerical and analytical solutions are presented for various cases of interest. The model results compare favorably with both experimental data and analytical solutions reported in the literature obtained for an incompressible air bubble migration. The results show that travel velocity of a compressible air bubble in porous media strongly depends on the depth of air phase injection. A bubble released from greater depths travels with a slower velocity than a bubble with an equal volume injected at shallower depths. As an air bubble rises up, it expands with decreasing bubble pressure with depth. The volume of a bubble injected at a 1-m depth increases 10% as the bubble reaches the water table. However, bubble volume increases almost twofold when it reaches to the surface from a depth of 10 m. The vertical rise velocity of a compressible bubble approaches that of an incompressible one regardless of the injection depth and volume as it reaches the water table. The compressible bubble velocity does not exceed 18.8 cm/s regardless of the injection depth and bubble volume. The results demonstrate that the effect of air compressibility on the motion of a bubble cannot be neglected except when the air is injected at very shallow depths.

AB [1] Soil erosion due to head cut development and migration can devastate agricultural lands, yet current prediction technology does not address this important erosion process. Here an analytical model of this erosional phenomenon is presented. Realistic, physically based approximations to the laws governing mass, momentum, and energy transfer in the neighborhood of the scour hole result in closed-form predictive algorithms for the magnitude of the plunge pool erosion and the rate of head cut migration. The model introduces a special treatment of nonventilated overfall conditions, is limited to homogeneous, unbounded soil layers, and is validated by available experimental measurements.

ID TIME DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; WATER-CONTENT; SOIL
AB The velocity of an electromagnetic (EM) wave in a system of layered geologic materials is determined by the velocities and volume fractions of the individual layers and by the ratio between the wavelength of the EM wave (lambda) and the average layer thickness (t). For the case pi < t the EM wave velocity is given by ray theory; for the case <lambda> > t the velocity is given by effective medium theory (EMT), Previous numerical studies have shown the transition from ray theory to effective medium theory to occur at lambda /t approximately equal to 4. Using laboratory time domain reflectometry (TDR), we measured the EM velocities of six layered samples composed of 50% dry coarse sand and 50% saturated fine sand. The hit for these measurements range from similar to0.5 to 25. For lambda /t ( 4 we measured the faster EM velocity predicted by ray theory; and when lambda /t > 4, we measured the slower EM velocity predicted by EMT. Reasonable agreement is found with numerical modeling of the experiments. In these experiments a 20% change in velocity is caused by a change in the thickness of the layers, with no change in the volume fraction of the coarse and fine sands. This illustrates the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in the interpretation of EM velocity.

The method is obtained by simplifying and extending a recent approximate solution and brings together features from several different studies. Difficulties associated with profile development are discussed by applying the method to several examples, providing a deeper understanding of the solutions of Richards' equation. For simplicity, we illustrate the improvements for soil-water diffusivities and conductivities which have a power law dependence on the water content although they should apply in general, and the appropriate generalization is given in the conclusion.

The assumptions on rainfall dynamics include the hypotheses that the maximum storm depth has a Generalized Pareto distribution, and that the temporal variability of rainfall depth in a storm can be described via power-law relationships. The SCS-CN model is used to describe the soil response, and a lumped model is adopted to transform the rainfall excess into peak flood; in particular, we analyse the influence of antecedent soil moisture condition on the flood frequency distribution. We then calculate the analytical expressions of the derived distributions of peak flood and maximum annual peak flood. Finally, practical case studies are presented and discussed.

AB Understanding and modelling the relationship between rainfall and runoff has been a driving force in hydrology for many years. Baseflow separation and recession analysis have been two of the main tools for understanding runoff generation in catchments, but there are many different methods for each. The new baseflow separation method presented here (the bump and rise method or BRM) aims to accurately simulate the shape of tracer-determined baseflow or pre-event water. Application of the method by calibrating its parameters, using (a) tracer data or (b) an optimising method, is demonstrated for the Glendhu Catchment, New Zealand. The calibrated BRM algorithm is then applied to the Glendhu streamflow record. The new recession approach advances the thesis that recession analysis of streamflow alone gives misleading information on catchment storage reservoirs because streamflow is a varying mixture of components of very different origins and characteristics (at the simplest level, quickflow and baseflow as identified by the BRM method). Recession analyses of quickflow, baseflow and streamflow show that the steep power-law slopes often observed for streamflow at intermediate flows are artefacts due to mixing and are not representative of catchment reservoirs. Applying baseflow separation before recession analysis could therefore shed new light on water storage reservoirs in catchments and possibly resolve some current problems with recession analysis. Among other things it shows that both quickflow and baseflow reservoirs in the studied catchment have (non-linear) quadratic characteristics.

AB A cylindrical sample, 0.5 m in diameter and length, was obtained by excavation from 3.7-4.2 m depth below ground surface in a surficial deposit of fractured glaciolacustrine clay. The sample was enclosed in a triaxial cell in a cold room to impose conditions close to field temperature and stress. Hydraulic testing using a hydraulic gradient of 2 provided a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 7 x 10(-10) mis, which is only slightly larger than the matrix hydraulic conductivity. The cubic law provided a mean hydraulic aperture of 5-6 mu m for the four continuous vertical fractures in the sample. A column of immiscible-phase trichloroethene (TCE) imposed incrementally at the top of the sample provided an entry-pressure-derived aperture equal to 17 mu m for a parallel-plate fracture. TCE dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) that flowed through the sample produced dissolved-phase diffusion haloes in the matrix that indicated the preferential fracture pathways. These haloes indicated that DNAPL flowed through only 5-15% of the visible, oxidation-stained fractures; hence natural fractures had variable apertures along their length, and the larger aperture regions provided channels for fluid flow. Using the hydraulic test results and applying the cubic law only to the aperture segments of confirmed DNAPL flow, an equivalent hydraulic aperture of 8-11 mu m was obtained, which is greater than the conventional mean hydraulic aperture and smaller than the local aperture determined from the DNAPL entry pressure. These differences are large in the context of fluid flux, which is proportional to the aperture cubed.

AB We present a novel microscopic model of sorption and convection of ions in heterogeneous media. Our model is based on an analogy to electron transport in a semiconductor. A new feature of our model is a power law random distribution of the adsorption time of ions. Diverging standard deviation of the distribution function yields anomalous ion transport. We show that this anomalous transport explains a concentration profile,with a long tail that has been observed in column experiments. We successfully fit recent experimental data. Finally, we propose new experiments by which we can check the validity of our model.

AB Relationships describing response times for landscape saturation and subsurface flow for idealised hillslopes after a change in water balance are derived in terms of similarity parameters given by their topographic. soil and climatic attributes. The study was carried out under a set of specific assumptions.
   The work quantitatively describes effects of each of these attributes on travel time. For example: divergent hillslopes can exhibit travel times that are double those of convergent hillslopes, and concave slopes tend to have lower travel times than planar or convex slopes. It is shown that the hillslope travel time T is dependent on hillslope length L. hydraulic conductivity K and slope S such that T = f(L\KS, B, CR, Deltaq/smd) and if saturation does not occur in the lower reaches of a hillslope. this can be simplified to T = f(L\ KS, B). Here, Deltaq is change in net external flux and smd is soil moisture deficit; CR and B are the convergence ratio and profile factor respectively. The relative importance of these attributes on response time is discussed.
   It is shown that subsurface flow hydrographs of simple hillslopes of different scale. derived numerically, can be collapsed into a single curve by normalising them by means of a form of response time. the time constant.
   Results from the analytical derivation were compared with numerical analysis with good agreement. The theory was applied to a natural catchment using observed data from a bushfire event. Comparison of analytically calculated response time with observed response time for the event showed a large discrepancy. The reason is discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HYDROLOGIC ANALYSIS; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; MASSACHUSETTS; SITES
AB Many investigators have sought to develop regional multivariate regression models which relate low-flow statistics to watershed characteristics. Normally, a multiplicative model structure is imposed and multivariate statistical procedures are employed to select suitable watershed characteristics and to estimate model parameters. Since such procedures have met with only limited success, we take a different approach. A simple conceptual stream-aquifer model is extended to a watershed scale and evaluated for its ability to approximate the low-flow behavior of 23 unregulated catchments in Massachusetts. The conceptual watershed model is then adapted to estimate low-flow statistics using multivariate regional regression procedures. Our results indicate that in central western Massachusetts, low-flow statistics are highly correlated with the product of watershed area, average basin slope and base flow recession constant, with the base flow recession constant acting as a surrogate for both basin hydraulic conductivity and drainable soil porosity.

AB The complexity of the formation and removal of nonwetting-phase residual in porous media provides a significant challenge to the development of theories needed to advance more effective aquifer remediation schemes. Constitutive theories are required to overcome theoretical deficiencies in describing behaviors such as the formation, dissolution, and mobilization of residual. Current macroscopic approaches are often unable to capture adequately the complexity of such processes, in these cases, pore-scale research should provide the necessary conceptual and quantitative basis for constitutive theory development. This work contributes to these efforts by investigating factors affecting residual in strongly wet, capillary-dominated systems. Porous media are modeled as three-dimensional networks of pore bodies and throats. A random network approach is developed, which provides stochastic geometry and variable connectivity. Immiscible displacement occurs via piston-displacement and film-flow mechanisms. Residual ganglia become trapped during imbibition. Wetting-phase continuity is maintained during drainage, disallowing the entrapment of wetting-phase ganglia. Results show that pore-scale geometric parameters significantly affect residual saturation, the ganglia-volume distribution, and nonwetting-wetting-phase interfacial area. Thus constitutive theory of residual should incorporate pore-scale knowledge to be valid for a wide range of conditions and porous media types. Comparison with quantitative experimental ganglia-volume distributions yields good agreement with the data trends but poor quantitative agreement. These results indicate the need for further experimental comparisons with theoretical results, linking macroscale and microscale theory and experiment.

AB A new procedure is presented to obtain exact solutions to groundwater how problems with free boundaries in the vertical plane. The solution procedure makes use of the hodograph method in combination with conformal mapping. The complex discharge function and the reference function are used as auxiliary functions. The function that maps the upper half plane onto the domain in the complex discharge plane is obtained by integration of the differential equation of Schwarz. The final solution is a linear combination of infinite series and consists of two functions: the conformal map of the upper half plane onto the physical plane and onto the complex potential plane. As an example, the problem of how over a horizontal base to a straight seepage face is solved. Flow nets are presented for two inclinations of the seepage face and rules are derived for the specification of boundary conditions along seepage faces in Dupuit-Forchheimer models.

ID SLOPE STABILITY; MODEL
AB A hydrogeomorphological model for shallow landslide prediction that considers both the stochastic character of rainfall intensity and duration and the deterministic aspects controlling slope stability is presented. The probability of shallow subsurface flow (i.e. the process triggering shallow landsliding) is expressed by a lognormal distribution. The short-term probability of landsliding is defined as the probability that the saturated depth exceeds a critical value. The average recurrence interval of landsliding T,v can be defined as the expected value of the recurrence interval of landsliding. This model was applied to a field site in Japan where extensive shallow landsliding occurred as a consequence of a heavy rainstorm in 1988. A digital elevation model was utilized to calculate T-av for every grid cell. it was found that T-av is a useful index to correlate to the susceptibility to shallow landsliding. A time series of landsliding was then simulated using this model. A series of values of return periods of rainfall (and, consequently, of saturated throughflow) were randomly generated for 10000 years (one rainstorm event per year). It was found that the spatial extent of landsliding (expressed as a percentage of scar area) associated with each rainstorm event was strongly influenced not only by rainfall, but also by the historical sequence of landsliding. The effective return period of rainfall for shallow landsliding was then estimated using the same model. It was found that rainfall events with return periods <500 years and <1000 years trigger about 50% and 65% respectively of the total number of landslides over the long term.

ID STEP OUTFLOW EXPERIMENTS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION
AB To describe the flow of water in unsaturated soils, the constitutive relationships of capillary pressure and relative permeability are necessary.  To measure these relationships using traditional methods may require different experimental apparatuses and can be time-consuming, particularly for multiple drainage and imbibition relationships for systems containing surfactants at various concentrations.  Thus a critical need exists for an apparatus that can make rapid measurements.  This paper outlines the design of an automated apparatus that can produce both capillary pressure and relative permeability relationships simultaneously and rapidly.  The rapidity of the measurements is based on the use of a thin soil sample, a highly conductive capillary barrier, and stripper tensiometers.  The capillary pressure is changed externally, with the change within the sample monitored through the use of tensiometers.  Saturation is determined by monitoring the cumulative effluent, with the accuracy of the mass balance enhanced through the active removal of air bubbles from beneath the capillary barrier.  A comparison of capillary pressure relationships for a fine-grained sandy porous medium produced with this apparatus with those produced with a Tempe cell shows that this apparatus yields comparable measurements in about 2% of the time.  Thus the burden of making multiple transport property measurements can be reduced considerably through the use of this apparatus.

We developed this lattice gas method for two-dimensional simulations of water flow in inhomogeneous media. Generalization to three dimensions is straightforward. The dynamics of the pesticide is simulated by particle tracking. After presenting the underlying discrete algorithms we emphasize calibration of the system. A soil is divided into homogeneous horizons, and our model is compared with the conventional one-dimensional model PESTLA. We observe good agreement for both water content profile and pesticide distribution. The random elements in our algorithms cause moderate fluctuations in the results. As an example of two-dimensional simulation, spatiotemporal pesticide patterns under a ridge are compared with the distribution under a flat soil surface.

TI Transient flow in bounded randomly heterogeneous domains 2. Localization
   of conditional mean equations and temporal nonlocality effects
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In randomly heterogeneous porous media one cannot predict flow behavior with certainty. One can, however, render optimum unbiased predictions of such behavior by means of conditional ensemble mean hydraulic heads and fluxes. We have shown in paper 1 [Tartakovsky and Neuman, this issue] that under transient flow, these optimum predictors are governed by nonlocal equations, In particular, the conditional mean flux is generally nonlocal in space-time and therefore non-Darcian. As such, it cannot be associated with an effective hydraulic conductivity except in special cases, Here we explore analytically situations under which localization is possible so that Darcy's law applies in real, Laplace, and/or infinite Fourier transformed spaces, approximately or exactly, with or without conditioning. We show that the corresponding conditional effective hydraulic conductivity tensor is generally nonsymmetric. An alternative to Darcy's law in each case, valid under mean no-flow conditions along Neumann boundaries, is a quasi-Darcian form that includes only a symmetric tensor which, however, does not constitute a bona fide effective hydraulic conductivity. Both lack of symmetry and differences between Darcian and quasi-Darcian forms disappear to first (but not necessarily higher) order of approximation in the (conditional) variance of natural log hydraulic conductivity. We adopt such an approximation to investigate analytically the effect of temporal nonlocality on one-and three-dimensional mean flows in infinite, statistically homogeneous media, Our results show that temporal nonlocality may manifest itself under either monotonic or oscillatory time variations in the mean hydraulic gradient. The effect of temporal nonlocality increases with the variance of log hydraulic conductivity and is more pronounced in one dimension than in three.

AB El Ni (n) over tildeo Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been linked to climate anomalies throughout the world. This paper presents an overview of global ENSO-streamflow teleconnection and identifies regions where the relationship may be exploited to forecast streamflow several months ahead. The teleconnection is investigated by fitting a first harmonic to 24-month El Ni (n) over tildeo streamflow composites from 581 catchments worldwide and the potential for forecasting is investigated by calculating the tag correlation between streamflow and two indicators of ENSO. The analyses indicate clear ENSO-streamflow teleconnections in many catchments, some of which are consistent across large geographical regions. Strong and regionally consistent ENSO-streamflow teleconnections are identified in Australia and New Zealand, South and Central America, and weaker signals are identified in some parts of Africa and North America. The results suggest that the ENSO-streamflow relationship and the serial correlation in streamflow can be used to successfully forecast streamflow. The streamflow forecasts can be used to help manage water resources, particularly in systems with high interannual variability in Australia, southern and drier parts of Africa and some areas of North America.

ID FREQUENCY; DURATION; IDENTIFICATION
AB Droughts are governed by regional climatic parameters. The ratio of mean annual precipitation (P-a) to global terrestrial mean annual precipitation (P-g), and the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration (E-p) to mean annual precipitation (P-a) have been used to define the climatic regions. The relationship of average drought frequency with the evapotranspiration/precipitation ratio (E-p/P-a) and the ratio of mean annual deficit to mean annual precipitation, (E-p - P-a)/P-a, are derived for arid, semiarid and subhumid climatic regions in India. The average annual drought frequency is found to decrease gradually from dry to wet regions. The return period varies from two to three years in arid regions (12 > E-p/P-a greater than or equal to 5), three to five years in semiarid regions (5 > E-p/P-a greater than or equal to 2), and five to eight years in subhumid regions (2 > E-p/P-a greater than or equal to 3/4). The results are compared with drought experiences in other countries. These relationships may be useful for critical analysis of drought and for planning of drought management strategies in a given region.

AB Numerical models of groundwater flow require hydraulic conductivity values for the gridblocks covering the flow domain. However, field conductivity data are usually measured at a different scale (usually smaller) than that of the gridblocks. The present paper describes an approach for upscaling to block-scale, which combines the rigorous result of small-value perturbation analysis with a plausible generalization of the first-order results to large variance. Steady-state flow through a block of stochastically heterogeneous medium, with constant values of the hydraulic head at the two opposite sides, is analysed. An upscaling rule and relationship is obtained between the local-scale hydraulic conductivity and the expected mean and variance of blockscale conductivity, where the block size is comparable with the correlation scale of the local conductivity held. The rather simple expressions that are obtained are validated using data from numerical experiments. Further, a generalized spatial power-averaging method to calculate the block-scale conductivity from values of local-scale conductivity is developed, in which the exponent value is given as a function of the ratios of how domain dimensions to the respective correlation length.

DE regional IDF formula; uncertainty analysis; MFOSM method; dimensionless
   frequency curve
AB A rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationship was generated by pooling annual maximum rainfall series from 14 recording rain gauges in southern Taiwan. Dimensionless frequency curves, plotted by the growth curve method, can be well fitted by regression equations for a duration ranging from 10 mins to 24 hours. As the parameters in regression equations have a good statistical relationship with average annual rainfall, a generalized regional IDF formula was then formulated. The formula, based on average annual rainfall as an index, can be easily applied to non-recording rain gauges. This paper further applies the mean value first-order second moment (MFOSM) method to estimate the uncertainty of the proposed regional IDF formula. From a stochastic viewpoint, the generalized regional IDF formula can accurately simulate the IDF relationship developed using frequency analysis (EV1) at individual stations. The method can provide both rainfall intensity and variance isohyetal maps for various rainfall durations and return periods over the study area. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study uses correlation analyses to explore relationships between the satellite-derived Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) - which depicts standardized anomalies in an actual to reference evapotranspiration (ET) fraction - and various land and atmospheric variables that impact ET. Correlations between the ESI and forcing variable anomalies calculated over sub-seasonal timescales were computed at weekly and monthly intervals during the growing season. Overall, the results revealed that the ESI is most strongly correlated to anomalies in soil moisture and 2m dew point depression. Correlations between the ESI and precipitation were also large across most of the US; however, they were typically smaller than those associated with soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit. In contrast, correlations were much weaker for air temperature, wind speed, and radiation across most of the US, with the exception of the south-central US where correlations were large for all variables at some point during the growing season. Together, these results indicate that changes in soil moisture and near-surface atmospheric vapor pressure deficit are better predictors of the ESI than precipitation and air temperature anomalies are by themselves. Large regional and seasonal dependencies were also observed for each forcing variable. Each of the regional and seasonal correlation patterns were similar for ESI anomalies computed over 2-, 4-, and 8-week time periods; however, the maximum correlations increased as the ESI anomalies were computed over longer time periods and also shifted toward longer averaging periods for the forcing variables.

AB To determine the origin of fractional flow dimensions identified from the results of pumping tests in fractured reservoir, the geometric specificities of synthetic networks are compared to flow dimensions obtained from simulated pumping tests. The modeled reservoirs studied in this paper constitute a system of orthogonal fractures generated by using a pseudo-random process controlled by simple mechanical rules. Flow induced by pumping is simulated while considering the intersections between discontinuities as pipes with various apertures. In many cases, the simulations result in fractional flow dimension although the flow-path network is not self-similar at different scales. We also show that the range of pipe conductance can affect early-time flow behavior although late-time flow behavior appears to be insensitive to the latter. Finally we propose an explanation for the fractional dimension of flow while considering the spatial distribution of interconnections between flow paths. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Migration of dissolved contaminants through subsurface environments may be enhanced by mobile colloidal particles. Lindqvist and Enfield [1992] have demonstrated that bacteria are capable of adsorbing and accelerating the movement of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) through columns containing sand. In the work reported here, a mathematical model for describing this bacteria-facilitated transport is presented. Our results indicate that the experimental data of Lindqvist and Enfield [1992] are most closely described by a model that incorporates a Freundlich isotherm equation for DDT adsorption to the bacteria, a second-order rate law for bacterial deposition, and a two-site, kinetic formulation for DDT adsorption by the porous medium.

AB Evaporation from wet canopies is commonly calculated using E-PM, the Penman-Monteith equation with zero surface resistance. However, several observations show a lower evaporation from rain-wetted forest. Possible causes for the difference between E-PM and experiments are evaluated to provide rules for the simulation of rainfall interception by forest canopies. The evaluation is executed using a micrometeorological model with a detailed representation of the forest canopy. Simulated results are compared with experimental results. In spite of theoretical reservations the evaporation of completely wet forest appears to agree with E-PM. Evaporation from wet forest appears mainly dependent on net radiation. Rainfall interception is related to evaporation from the canopy. Evaporation from the canopy appears proportional with the square root of canopy cover and sensitive to canopy wetness. An accurate estimate of canopy wetness is needed to use E-PM for the calculation of evaporation from rain-wetted forest.

AB Pore-scale network models of two-phase capillary displacement in porous media may be used to predict constitutive relationships between the capillary pressure, saturation, and relative permeabilities at the continuum scale. Since these constitutive relationships reflect ensembles of pore-scale events, spatial correlation in the pore structure is expected to be an important consideration. Correlations in the pore structure are also evident in recent experimental studies. Pore-scale network models are used here in a quantitative investigation of the influence of correlations on the capillary pressure-saturation-relative permeability relationships. The pore space is modeled using a cubic lattice larger than 12 times the spatial correlation scale in each direction. The following two types of correlations are incorporated: spatial correlation between the radii of bonds oriented along the same direction and cross correlation between the radii of bonds emanating from the same site in all directions. Results demonstrate that the saturation-relative permeability relationship is not very sensitive to unidirectional spatial correlation but is sensitive to cross correlation. Pore-scale model parameters are fit to capillary pressure-saturation data from several real soils, followed by a prediction of the relative permeability curves for the same soils. The predicted relative permeabilities are compared to the measured values and predictions using the traditional van Genuchten relationships. The pore-scale model is shown to fit the capillary-pressure saturation curves and predict the saturation-relative permeability curves with a degree of accuracy comparable to the van Genuchten relationships. While these computations have been restricted to unconsolidated soils, they demonstrate the potential of pore-scale models for predicting other transport properties such as dispersivities and mass transfer coefficients.

AB [1] A lock exchange experiment is used to investigate the propagation of gravity currents through a random array of rigid, emergent cylinders which represents a canopy of aquatic plants. As canopy drag increases, the propagating front varies from the classic profile of an unobstructed gravity current to a triangular profile. Unlike the unobstructed lock exchange, the gravity current in the canopy decelerates with time as the front lengthens. Two drag-dominated regimes associated with linear and nonlinear drag laws are identified. The theoretical expression for toe velocity is supported by observed values. Empirical criteria are developed to predict the current regime from the cylinder Reynolds number and the array density.

ID POLLUTION
AB This article presents a comparative static framework for predicting the water quality outcomes of water trade. The focus is on a comprehensive treatment of water quality processes. Previous work has assumed that reductions in agriculturally induced water quality externalities are an increasing function of irrigation application rates. The comparative static framework used here allows for the possibility that water transfer can result in both positive and negative water quality externalities as the result of dilution, even when the rate of loading decreases. We apply our model to the Owyhee aquifer of eastern Oregon, an area where nitrate concentrations exceeded the EPA standard of 10 ppm in over 30% of area test wells in 1991. In conclusion, we describe conditions when water trade is most likely to generate positive versus negative water quality externalities. We also draw policy conclusions about the kinds of institutional rules best suited to balance trade-offs between gains to trade, water quality externalities, and transactions costs.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

DT Article
ID ONE-DIMENSIONAL INFILTRATION
AB A simplified Newton iteration method with Galerkin linear finite elements is developed for the solution of the nonlinear transient unsaturated flow equation in ''mixed'' form. The use of the Galerkin linear finite element method in the spatial discretization produces a recurrence equation in which the internode hydraulic conductivity is represented by an integrated average expression which generates the exact Darcy flow flux through each element under the steady horizontal flow condition. The numerical computation of the integrated average hydraulic conductivity using Simpson's 1/3 rule leads to an accurate solution even in the presence of a sharp front. In the time discretization using a backward Euler scheme, the standard Newton iteration method is simplified by taking account of the integrated average expression of the hydraulic conductivity and the diffusion-dominated nature of the flow process. The resulting two-level scheme is of the same efficiency on a per-iteration basis as the modified Picard scheme but converges at a faster rate.

AB Several successful applications of optimal control theory based on the Pontryagin's minimum principle have been recorded in literature for optimizing the operating policy of multi-reservoir systems. However, the application of optimal control theory in sizing multi-reservoir systems resulted in sub-optimal solution. In this study, an optimization model based on a new composite algorithm is introduced. This model applies optimal control theory and penalty successive linear programming as two promising techniques to optimize large and complex water supply systems. The epsilon constraint approach was implemented in the model in order to consider the two non-commensurate objectives of minimizing cost and water deficit. The application of this model to a multi-reservoir system was compared to an existing dynamic programming model. The result of this study showed that the developed model is a very promising optimization method to design multi-reservoir systems regardless of their sizes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID FLOW
AB The effect of drought on groundwater heads and discharge is often complex and poorly understood. Therefore the propagation of a drought from groundwater recharge to discharge and the influence of aquifer characteristics on the propagation was analysed by tracking a drought in recharge through a linear reservoir. The recharge was defined as a sinusoid function with a period of 1 year. The decrease in recharge owing to drought was simulated by multiplying the recharge during 1 year with a drought fraction between 0 and 1, which represents a decrease in the recharge of 100 to 0%, respectively. The droughts were identified using the threshold level approach, with a threshold that is constant in time. For this case analytical formulations were derived, which express the drought duration and deficit in the groundwater discharge in terms of the decrease in recharge, the reservoir coefficient that characterizes aquifer properties and the height of the threshold level. The results showed that the delay in the groundwater system caused a shift of the main part of the decrease in recharge from the high-flow to the low-flow period. This resulted in an increase in drought deficit for discharge compared with the drought deficit for recharge. Also the development of multiyear droughts caused an increase in drought deficit. The attenuation in the groundwater system caused a decrease in drought deficit. In most cases the net effect of these processes was an increase of drought deficit as a result of the propagation through groundwater. Only for small droughts the deficit decreased from recharge to discharge. The amount of increase or decrease depends on the reservoir coefficient and the severity of the drought. Under most conditions a maximum in the drought deficit occurred for a reservoir coefficient of around 200 days. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB To produce probability distributions for regional climate change in surface temperature and precipitation, a probability distribution for global mean temperature increase has been combined with the probability distributions for the appropriate scaling variables, i.e. the changes in regional temperature/precipitation per degree global mean warming. Each scaling variable is assumed to be normally distributed. The uncertainty of the scaling relationship arises from systematic differences between the regional changes from global and regional climate model simulations and from natural variability. The contributions of these sources of uncertainty to the total variance of the scaling variable are estimated from simulated temperature and precipitation data in a suite of regional climate model experiments conducted within the framework of the EU-funded project PRUDENCE, using an Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA). For the area covered in the 2001-2004 EU-funded project SWURVE, five case study regions (CSRs) are considered: NW England, the Rhine basin, Iberia, Jura lakes (Switzerland) and Mauvoisin dam (Switzerland). The resulting regional climate changes for 2070-2099 vary quite significantly between CSRs, between seasons and between meteorological variables. For all CSRs, the expected warming in summer is higher than that expected for the other seasons. This summer warming is accompanied by a large decrease in precipitation. The uncertainty of the scaling ratios for temperature and precipitation is relatively large in summer because of the differences between regional climate models. Differences between the spatial climate-change patterns of global climate model simulations make significant contributions to the uncertainty of the scaling ratio for temperature. However, no meaningful contribution could sometimes be found for the scaling ratio for precipitation due to the small number of global climate models in the PRUDENCE project and natural variability, which is often the largest source of uncertainty. In contrast, for temperature, the contribution of natural variability to the total variance of the scaling ratio is small, in particular for the annual mean values. Simulation from the probability distributions of global mean warming and the scaling ratio results in a wider range of regional temperature change than that in the regional climate model experiments. For the regional change in precipitation, however, a large proportion of the simulations (about 90%) is within the range of the regional climate model simulations.

AB We investigated the late-time (asymptotic) behavior of tracer test breakthrough curves (BTCs) with rate-limited mass transfer (e.g., in dual-porosity or multiporosity systems) and found that the late-time concentration c is given by the simple expression c = t(ad){(c(0)g - [m(0)(partial derivativeg/partial derivativet)]}, for t much greater than t(ad) and t(alpha) much greater than t(ad), where t(ad) is the advection time, co is the initial concentration in the medium, mo is the zeroth moment of the injection pulse, and t, is the mean residence time in the immobile domain (i.e., the characteristic mass transfer time). The function g is proportional to the residence time distribution in the immobile domain; we tabulate g for many geometries, including several distributed (multirate) models of mass transfer. Using this expression, we examine the behavior of late-time concentration for a number of mass transfer models. One key result is that if rate-limited mass transfer causes the ETC to behave as a power law at late time (i.e., c similar to t(-k)), then the underlying density function of rate coefficients must also be a power law with the form alpha (k-3) as alpha --> 0. This is true for both density functions of first-order and diffusion rate coefficients. BTCs with k < 3 persisting to the end of the experiment indicate a mean residence time longer than the experiment, and possibly an infinite residence time, and also suggest an effective rate coefficient that is either undefined or changes as a function of observation time. We apply our analysis to breakthrough curves from single-well injection-withdrawal tests at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, New Mexico.

AB Physically-based models of blowing snow and windflow are used to develop a distributed model of blowing snow transport and sublimation over complex terrain. The model is applied to an arctic tundra basin. A reasonable agreement with results from snow surveys is obtained, provided sublimation processes an included; a simulation without sublimation produces much greater snow accumulations than were measured. The model is able to reproduce some observed features of redistributed snowcovers: distributions of snow mass, classified by vegetation type and landform, can be approximated by lognormal distributions, and standard deviations of snow mass along transects follow a power law with transect length up to a cut-off. The representation used for the downwind development of blowing snow with changes in windspeed and surface characteristics is found to have a large moderating influence on snow redistribution.

AB [1] We have conducted laboratory experiments to examine CaCO3 dissolution and precipitation in saltwater-freshwater mixing zones, with a view to understanding and predicting porosity changes in coastal environments. Mixing of seawater or saline subsurface water with fresh water can be of major importance in the chemical diagenesis of carbonate rocks and sediments. We used artificial seawater and NaCl solutions of different concentrations under different CO2 partial pressures and with different mixing ratios. Two-dimensional flow cells filled with glass beads and crushed calcium carbonate rock were used to measure calcium carbonate precipitation and dissolution, respectively. An important feature of these experiments is that the results are shown to agree well with a relatively simple transport theory describing mineral precipitation/dissolution that results from the nonlinear dependence of CaCO3 saturation upon electrolyte concentration. The theory demonstrates that the rate of dissolution or precipitation depends on the curvature ( and sign) of the solubility as a function of salinity, the square of the salinity gradient, and the macroscopic dispersion coefficient. The theory is largely scale independent and depends upon field parameters that can be determined. Analysis of data from three field sites (Yucatan peninsula, Bermuda, and Mallorca) demonstrates excellent agreement between field observations and theory.

ID CAPILLARY-PRESSURE; 2-PHASE FLOW; DARCYS-LAW; NETWORK MODEL; EQUATIONS
AB We consider immiscible two-phase flow in porous media, starting with the Stokes equations. Our analysis leads to Darcy's law but with notable differences from the usual interpretation. The most immediate difference is the interpretation of macroscale pressure, which, contrary to previous derivations, does not equal the intrinsic phase average pressure. We recover the intrinsic average only when systematic subscale heterogeneities, in material properties or fluid distribution, are absent. Examples using capillary tube and dynamic pore network models are given. These results impact our understanding of multiphase flow and have a direct effect on numerical upscaling efforts, including calculations of continuum-scale flow parameters from pore-scale network models.

AB Rainfall is the most important water resource in central and western Sudan, a region affected by the recent drought in Africa. A general methodology for studying the annual rainfall process is presented and applied to data from central and western Sudan. It is assumed that certain time series models adequately describe the annual rainfall process in the region. Based on this assumption, the drought frequencies are calculated in the subregions with stationary series. The theory of runs is applied in calculating drought frequencies using a data generation method.

ID CRITERIA DECISION-MAKING
AB An ongoing water supply planning problem in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, is studied to select the best water supply combination, within a multiple-objective framework, when actions are interdependent,The interdependencies in the problem are described and shown to be essential features. The problem is formulated as a multiple-criteria integer program with interdependent actions. Because of the large number of potential actions and the nonconvexity of the decision space, it is quite difficult to find nondominated subsets of actions. Instead, a modified goal programming technique is suggested to identify promising subsets. The appropriateness of this technique is explained, and the lessons learned in applying it to the Waterloo water supply planning problem are described.

TI SAMPLING DESIGN FOR SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED HYDROGEOLOGIC AND
   ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES
SO ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
DE SAMPLING DESIGN; INTRINSIC SPATIAL RANDOM FIELDS; GEOSTATISTICS
AB A methodology for the design of sampling networks over space is proposed. The methodology is based on spatial random field representations of nonhomogeneous natural processes, and on optimal spatial estimation techniques. One of the most important results of random field theory for physical sciences is its rationalization of correlations in spatial variability of natural processes. This correlation is extremely important both for interpreting spatially distributed observations and for predictive performance. The extent of site sampling and the types of data to be collected will depend on the relationship of subsurface variability to predictive uncertainty. While hypothesis formulation and initial identification of spatial variability characteristics are based on scientific understanding (such as knowledge of the physics of the underlying phenomena, geological interpretations, intuition and experience), the support offered by field data is statistically modelled. This model is not limited by the geometric nature of sampling and covers a wide range in subsurface uncertainties. A factorization scheme of the sampling error variance is derived, which possesses certain atttactive properties allowing significant savings in computations. By means of this scheme, a practical sampling design procedure providing suitable indices of the sampling error variance is established. These indices can be used by way of multiobjective decision criteria to obtain the best sampling strategy. Neither the actual implementation of the in-situ sampling nor the solution of the large spatial estimation systems of equations are necessary. The required values of the accuracy parameters involved in the network design are derived using reference charts (readily available for various combinations of data configurations and spatial variability parameters) and certain simple yet accurate analytical formulas. Insight is gained by applying the proposed sampling procedure to realistic examples related to sampling problems in two dimensions.

AB We present the analytical solutions to a hillslope-based formulation of subsurface storm flow and saturation overland flow. Here a hillslope is defined as the area between two streamlines originating from two ends of a channel link or from the channel head and ending at the ridgelines. The three-dimensional soil mantle of a hillslope is reduced to a one-dimensional profile along which the soil moisture and discharge are modeled. Continuity and a kinematic form of Darcy's law lead to quasi-linear wave equations solvable with the method of characteristics. Examples are given to illustrate the ability and limitations of the solutions in capturing the essential runoff behavior of different slope types.

TI UNBIASED PLOTTING POSITION FORMULAS FOR HISTORICAL FLOODS
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The existing plotting position formulae which consider historical floods are reviewed and discussed.  The plotting positions for systematic record floods below the threshold must be adjusted to reflect the additional information provided by the pre-gauging period if the historical flood data and the systematic record are to be analysed jointly in a consistent and statistically efficient manner.  However, all available formulae are unlikely to adjust these plotting positions properly.  It is felt that the traditional rule and exceedance rule assumptions are inconsistent with the floods over and below the threshold of perception of historical floods.  A new type of formula which uses the same concept as the historically weighted moments is proposed and examined.  Simulation studies and numerical examples show that the new formula type performs better than the traditional Weibull rule both in descriptive and predictive abilities.  If an unbiased plotting position formula is required, then the proposed modified exceedance Cunnane formula would be the best selection.

AB The information and data used to support decision making under uncertainty in water resources situations can often be characterized as being very limited or weak. The representation of knowledge in conventional Bayesian decision analysis is in the form of precisely specified distributions and is the same no matter how weak the information source for this knowledge. A Bayesian analysis therefore may inadvertently impart too much precision to the input information and to the results. The concept of imprecise probability addresses this problem of excessive precision and a number of methods incorporating this concept have emerged. One such method, developed by Dempster and Shafer, accommodates greater imprecision by allowing the specification of probabilities on intervals. Theoretical aspects of the Dempster-Shafer methodology and its application to inference and decision analysis are described. A water resources example of an application of the Dempster-Shafer approach is presented, and the results contrasted with those obtained from the closest equivalent Bayesian scheme.

ID QUADRATIC GAUSSIAN CONTROL; GROUNDWATER
AB A major complicating factor in water resources systems management is handling unknown inputs. Stochastic optimization provides a sound mathematical framework but requires that enough data exist to develop statistical input representations. In cases where data records are insufficient (e.g., extreme events) or atypical of future input realizations, stochastic methods are inadequate. This article presents a control approach where input variables are only expected to belong in certain sets. The objective is to determine sets of admissible control actions guaranteeing that the system will remain within desirable bounds. The solution is based on dynamic programming and derived for the case where all sets are convex polyhedra. A companion paper (Yao and Georgakakos, this issue) addresses specific applications and problems in relation to reservoir system management.

TI Quantifying the effects of stream discharge on summer river temperature
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Control of summer river temperature is needed for maintaining water temperature standards to protect aquatic biota and wildlife habitats. Given the fact that instream discharge, among meteorological and hydrological factors, may be the only one that can be practically managed, is it feasible to moderate summer river temperature through reservoir and streamflow regulations? An analysis is conducted to quantify the effects of the magnitude of instream flow on summer river temperature with weather as a reference. Relationships between water temperature and river discharge or flow depth are developed using a simplified model and adopting the concept of equilibrium temperature and bulk surface heat exchange coefficient. The relationships are validated against continuous 5-year field measurements at the central Platte River, Nebraska, USA. It was found that the variation of daily maximum water temperature with now was stronger than that of daily mean. A critical discharge was obtained, which divides dramatic drop and slow variation in river temperature values. The existence of the critical discharge makes it possible to reduce or minimize the occurrence of daily maximum water temperature exceeding a standard at a river reach by increasing discharge to an achievable level. This study advances understanding of impacts of instream flow on summer river temperature and provides information useful in proper planning and design of reservoir operations and streamflow management.

ID GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; MODELS
AB A model has been developed that takes weekly stream temperature and weather data and determines the potential effects of stream channel shading, wind sheltering, and secondary (hydrologic) sources of heat on the observed stream temperatures. The partitioning (parameterization) of these effects is done via an empirical optimization procedure known as the shuffled complex evolution global optimization method. On the basis of data from 596 stream gauging stations in the eastern and central United States, the results of this analysis indicate that, on average, the effect of shading is stronger than the effect of sheltering and that the inclusion of a parameter for secondary heat input improves the simulation of the stream temperatures. The results increase our understanding of annual and seasonal controls on stream temperature at a regional spatial scale. By providing the above information for a large number of streams in the eastern and central United States, we have learned about typical values and ranges of stream shading and sheltering and have learned that hydrologic heat inputs cannot be ignored for many stream reaches. We have developed more realistic expectations of secondary heat inputs to streams. With this information, we will be better prepared to estimate and appreciate the effects of land use changes or climate changes on stream temperatures and hence on stream habitats.

AB Geological and pedological processes rarely form isotropic media as is usually assumed in transport studies. Anisotropy at the Darcy or field scale may be detected directly by measuring flow parameters or may become indirectly evident from movement and shape of solute plumes. Anisotropic behavior of a soil at one scale may, in many cases, be related to the presence of lower-scale directional structures. Miller similitude with different pore-scale geometries of the basic element is used to model macroscopic flow and transport behavior. Analytical expressions for the anisotropic conductivity tensor are derived based on the dynamic law that governs the flow problem at the pore scale. The effects of anisotropy on transport parameters are estimated by numerical modeling.

AB A reassessment-improvement of a previous work by the authors is proposed on the inversion of hydraulic interference testing by means of dual-porosity-medium approaches. The tests have been performed over a fractured limestone aquifer (Poitiers, France) showing a preferential and rapid flow path along open karstic drains. All draw-down curves are merged together both in amplitude and time irrespective of their location relative to the single pumped well and classical dual-porosity-medium approaches are unable to mimic this behavior. A pressure wave propagation by advection is added to the classical diffusion equations of dual-porosity-medium in order to stress the medium almost evenly whatever the distance from the pumped well. The problem is set up to keep the continuous dual-porosity-medium framework with only two state variables, i.e. the heads in fractures and matrix. Even though the wave velocity is not well-conditioned because the ratio of the volume of drains to the total volume of the medium is unknown, automatic inversion remains feasible. The dual-porosity-medium (without the drains) can be homogeneous or fractal, having in the Latter case hydraulic parameters ruled by scaling power laws. In both cases, it is shown that adding an advection term allows to invert accurately all experimental drawdown curves. Statistical fluctuations of the sought hydraulic parameters are quite small and do not show any trend with respect to the distance. Thus, modifying a dual-porosity-medium approach by adding an advection term allows for the homogenization of a reservoir that combines the general drainage of a fracture-matrix system and a rapid drainage through karstic conduits.

AB This paper presents a hypothesis regarding the fundamental role of soil moisture conditions in land-atmosphere interactions. We propose that wet soil moisture conditions over any large region should be associated with relatively large boundary layer moist static energy, which favors the occurrence of more rainfall. Since soil moisture conditions themselves reflect past occurrence of rainfall, the proposed hypothesis implies a positive feedback mechanism between soil moisture and rainfall. This mechanism is based on considerations of the energy balance at the land-atmosphere boundary, in contrast to similar mechanisms that were proposed in the past and that were based on the concepts of water balance and precipitation recycling. The control of soil moisture on surface albedo and Bowen ratio is the fundamental basis of the proposed soil moisture-rainfall feedback mechanism. The water content in the upper soil layer affects these two important properties of the land surface such that both variables decrease with any increase in the water content of the top soil layer. The direct effect of soil moisture on surface albedo implies that wet soil moisture conditions enhance net solar radiation. The direct effect of soil moisture on Bowen ratio dictates that wet soil moisture conditions would tend to enhance net terrestrial radiation at the surface through cooling of surface temperature, reduction of upwards emissions of terrestrial radiation, and simultaneous increase in atmospheric water vapor content and downwards flux of terrestrial radiation. Thus, under wet soil moisture conditions, both components of net radiation are enhanced, resulting in a larger total flux of heat from the surface into the boundary layer. This total flux represents the sum of the corresponding sensible and latent heat fluxes. Simultaneously, cooling of surface temperature should be associated with a smaller sensible heat flux and a smaller depth of the boundary layer. Whenever these processes occur over a large enough area, the enhanced flux of heat from the surface into the smaller reservoir of boundary layer air should favor a relatively large magnitude of moist static energy per unit mass of the boundary layer air. The dynamics of localized convective storms as well as the dynamics of large-scale atmospheric circulations have been shown to be sensitive to the distribution of boundary layer moist static energy by several previous studies. These theoretical concepts are tested using field observations from Kansas and explored further in a companion paper [Zheng and Eltahir, this issue] using a simple numerical model.

AB In this study, we explored the spatio-temporal variability of surface saturation within a forested headwater catchment using a combined simulation-observation approach. We simulated the occurrence of surface saturation in the Weierbach catchment (Luxembourg) with the physically based model HydroGeoSphere. We confronted the simulation with thermal infrared images that we acquired during a 2-year mapping campaign for seven distinct riparian areas with weekly to biweekly recurrence frequency. Observations and simulations showed similar saturation dynamics across the catchment. The observed and simulated relation of surface saturation to catchment discharge resembled a power law relationship for all investigated riparian areas but varied to a similar extent, as previously observed between catchments of different morphological and topographical characteristics. The observed spatial patterns and frequencies of surface saturation varied between and within the investigated areas and the model reproduced these spatial variations well. The good performance of the simulation suggested that surface saturation in the Weierbach catchment is largely controlled by exfiltration of groundwater into local topographic depressions. However, the simulated surface saturation contracted faster than observed, the simulated saturation dynamics were less variable between the investigated areas than observed, and the match of simulated and observed saturation patterns was not equally good in all investigated riparian areas. These mismatches between observations and simulation highlight that the intra-catchment variability of surface saturation must also result from factors that were not considered in the model set-up, such as differing subsurface structures or a differing persistence of surface saturation due to local morphological features like perennial springs.

AB We derive a new cubic polynomial approximation to the similarity solution of the Boussinesq equation for one-dimensional, unconfined groundwater flow in a horizontal, initially dry aquifer with a power law inlet condition. This derivation builds upon the work of Lockington et al. (Adv. Wat. Resour. 23 (7) (2000) 725), where a quadratic approximation is constructed, and uses an additional condition for the determination of the (approximate) scaling function. The approximate analytical solutions are compared with the direct numerical solution obtained by Shampine's method (ZAMM 53 (1973) 421). In all the tests performed, the new cubic approximation gives better results than the quadratic one, while it is only slightly harder to use. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We have analysed a series of surface samples from the alpine glaciers of Taylor Valley, Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica for their geochemical composition. This was done to better establish the role of glaciochemical variation on the chemical composition of meltwater streams emanating from the glaciers. The chemistry of the snow and ice changes with proximity to the ocean and with elevation of the glacier surface. The aeolian transport of dry valley dust, as indicated by both chemical and particulate matter variations, is a major process affecting the overall glacier chemistry and the chemistry of the meltwaters. Streams originating on the western edges of the glaciers are more impacted by the aeolian input as they are in the direct path of the major regional wind direction. Our data strongly suggest that the variation in stream geochemistry in Taylor Valley is a result in part of the differences in chemical composition of glacier melt.

ID TRICKLE IRRIGATION; TRAVEL-TIMES; DIFFUSIVITY; TRANSPORT
AB Raats' [1971] steady state theory is here extended to provide an approximate analysis of the transient pattern of wetting around a point source. The assumption that a steady state regime prevails behind the wet front and the use of the Clothier [1984] and Philip [1984] theories on water movement along the streamlines allows an approximate transient solution for surface point source infiltration to be developed. This procedure was previously tested against absorption theory and laboratory experiments [Revel et al., 1995], but now this new analysis is evaluated via a field test. The vertical elongating influence of gravity is found to be well predicted. Application of this analysis to design purposes is also mentioned. The role of the macroscopic characteristic capillary length of unsaturated flow, lambda(c), is highlighted by this approximate solution. Finally, we propose a method that allows estimation of lambda(c) from a point-source infiltration experiment.

ID SOUTHERN TUNISIA
AB The study of the coastal basins of Sfax and Djeffara in northern Gabes, based on the interpretation of hydrochemical (major elements) and isotopic (O-18, H-2 and C-14) data, has allowed us to understand the hydrodynamic functioning of the Miocene aquifer. Indeed, the geochemical data highlight the presence of two different groundwater types: (Na-Cl) in the Sfax basin and (Cl/SO4-Ca/Na) to (Na-Cl) in the northern Gabes basin. This difference between groundwater types underlines the variability of the origins of groundwater mineralization. The use of isotopic tools showed a relatively old water, with the exception of some local recent recharge inferred by the rainwater infiltration through Zemlet Beida Mountain in the upstream part of the northern Gabes basin. This is also confirmed by the high C-14 contents of groundwater in this region. Consequently, it is noted that the transition from south to north along the coast is marked by a big lateral variation of lithology and thickness of the water-bearing formation, underlining the independence of the coastal aquifers of Sfax and Djeffara in the absence of any significant flow exchange between the two basins.

A scale length of mean pore size was used to estimate the microscopic system length of fingering.

The system is divided into three subsystems with specific flood control objectives. The Three-Gorges Reservoir plays an important role in the system. A method for producing flood operation alternatives of the Three-Gorges Reservoir is presented. Finally, the model is validated with three typical historical floods. The results show that the model is effective and flexible.

AB In this paper fuzzy models are used as an alternative to describe groundwater flow in the unsaturated zone. The core of these models consists of a fuzzy rule-based model of the Takagi-Sugeno type. Various fuzzy clustering algorithms are compared in the data-driven identification of these Takagi-Sugeno models. The performance of the resulting fuzzy models is evaluated on the training surface on which they were identified, and on time series measurements of water content values obtained through an experiment carried out by the non-vegetated terrain (NVT) workgroup of the European Microwave Signature Laboratory (EMSL) (see [Mancini M, Hoeben R, Troch PA. Multifrequency radar observations of bare surface soil moisture content: a laboratory experiment. Water Resour Res 1999;35(6):1827-38] and [Hoeben R, Troch PA. Assimilation of active microwave observation data for soil moisture profile estimation. Water Resour Res 2000;36(10):2805-19]). Despite higher errors at the borders of high water content values in the training surface, good results are obtained on the simulation of the time series. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID UNITED-STATES; ENVIRONMENT; WATER
AB This paper considers application of interconnected game theory to modeling of bilateral agreements for sharing common pool resources under conditions of unequal access. Linking negotiations to issues with reciprocal benefits through interconnected game theory has been proposed in other settings to achieve international cooperation because it can avoid outcomes that are politically unacceptable due to the "victim pays" principle. Previous studies have not considered adequately the critical nature of this political infeasibility, if it exists, in determining advantages of interconnection. This paper investigates how game structure and benefits suggested by interconnected game theory are altered when victim pays strategies are removed from the feasibility set. Linking games is shown to have greater advantages than when the structural implications of eliminating victim pays strategies are not considered. Conversely, a class of cases exists where the full cooperation benefits of interconnection are attainable without linking through isolated component games when victim pays outcomes are feasible.

AB In recent years a new theory of the evolution of drainage networks and associated landscapes has emerged, mainly in connection with the development of fractal geometry and of self-organized criticality (SOC) concepts. This theory has much improved our understanding of the mechanisms which determine the structure of natural landscapes and their dynamics of evolution. In the first part of this paper the main ideas in the theory of landscape self-organization are outlined, and some remarkable features of the resulting structures are presented. In the second part we apply theoretical tools developed in the context of multifractal fields to the study of the scaling properties of the field of elevations of SOC landscapes. We observe that such landscapes appear to be more complex than simple self-affine fractals, although in some cases a simple fractal framework may be adequate for their description. We also show that multiple scaling may emerge as a result of heterogeneity in the field properties reflecting climate and geology.

   fluid; multi-phase flow
AB Flow and displacement of non-Newtonian fluids in porous media occurs in many subsurface systems, related to underground natural resource recovery and storage projects, as well as environmental remediation schemes. A thorough understanding of non-Newtonian fluid flow through porous media is of fundamental importance in these engineering applications. Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of single-phase porous flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids through many quantitative and experimental studies over the past few decades. However, very little research can be found in the literature regarding multi-phase non-Newtonian fluid flow or numerical modeling approaches for such analyses.
   For non-Newtonian fluid flow through porous media, the governing equations become nonlinear, even under single-phase Bow conditions, because effective viscosity for the non-Newtonian fluid is a highly nonlinear function of the shear rate, or the pore velocity. The solution for such problems can in general only be obtained by numerical methods.
   We have developed a three-dimensional, fully implicit, integral finite difference simulator for single-and multi-phase flow of non-Newtonian fluids in porous/fractured media. The methodology, architecture and numerical scheme of the model are based on a general multi-phase, multi-component fluid and heat flow simulator-TOUGH2. Several rheological models for power-law and Bingham non-Newtonian fluids have been incorporated into the model. In addition, the model predictions on single-and multi-phase flow of the power-law and Bingham fluids have been verified against the analytical solutions available for these problems, and in all the cases the numerical simulations are in good agreement with the analytical solutions. In this presentation, we will discuss the numerical scheme used in the treatment of non-Newtonian properties, and several benchmark problems for model verification.
   In an effort to demonstrate the three-dimensional modeling capability of the model, a three-dimensional, two-phase flow example is also presented to examine the model results using laboratory and simulation results existing for the three-dimensional problem with Newtonian fluid flow.

   BENDS; FLOW MODEL; AMPLITUDE; DEFORMATION; VELOCITY
AB The response of a meandering river to lateral tilting of the floodplain that supports the river is studied theoretically. Here, the lateral direction is perpendicular to the overall direction of the river on the floodplain. It is found that for most natural meandering rivers, the river will migrate down the tilt direction to a lower elevation. However, the theory also shows that under some conditions? especially when the Froude number of the flow in the channel is very small, the river migration is biased in the opposite direction. Two major contributions to the response of the river to lateral tilting, identified in the theory, are (1) perturbation of the cross-section-averaged flow velocities and (2) modification of the near-bank flow velocity variation along the channel. The theory is one of the first attempts to develop a quantitative understanding of the effects of floodplain tilting on meandering rivers, and it provides a framework for future studies.

AB We report a study of solute transport in snow, using artificial rain-on-snow experiments with conservative anions (F(-), Br(-), and SO(4)(2-)). The tracers were mixed into tap water and sprayed onto the snow surface from two water supply tanks. The water flux out of the base of the snowpack was recorded, and discharge samples were collected and analyzed for the three tracers. The chemical concentration of tracers in the discharge was negatively associated with the water flux. The objectives of the experiment were to test whether the mobile-immobile model (MIM) with variable mobile-immobile water exchange coefficient can simulate both positive and negative concentration-discharge relationships in this and previous tracer experiments. By simulating our experimental data, we confirm that it is necessary for the exchange coefficient to increase with water velocity. In addition, we use the model to show that with a diurnal variation of clean water flux, a negative concentration-discharge relationship occurs when solutes are evenly distributed in the mobile and immobile fluids, while a positive relationship occurs when the solutes were present only in the immobile fluid near the surface. This result may help in explaining the complicated concentration-discharge relationships observed in catchments.

ID RECESSION
AB A low-flow equation is derived from Darcy's law and a mass balance equation for base flow from a hillside by assuming that groundwater recharge is constant over short time periods. This low-flow equation reduces to many of the existing mechanistic low-flow equations, but in its general form looks like a linear regression model and captures spatial variability in base flow among hillsides in a basin. As a result, it unifies the mechanics and statistics of low flows in river networks. This equation is tested against low-flow data from the Flint River basin in Georgia and the Gasconade River basin in Missouri, both of which are approximately 7000 km(2) in size.

ID SOLUTE TRANSPORT; GROUNDWATER-FLOW; POROUS-MEDIA; MODEL
AB Existing theories of flow and contaminant transport in aquifers are either based on Monte Carlo simulations or small perturbation solutions of the governing stochastic partial differential equations, which limit the applications to cases of small variances in the physical parameters, In this article scale-dependent models to predict mean contaminant concentration from point sources (well injection), and non-point sources (ground surface spills) in heterogeneous aquifers are developed and tested. A general analytic technique, the Neumann expansion, is used in the solution of the equations. This method does not require the assumptions of small perturbation, logarithmic transformations, or a specific probability law in the random quantities. In addition, aquifer parameters such as the mean pore velocity are functionally defined in terms of the underlying groundwater flow problem, and field-measurable aquifer hydrogeologic properties such as mean transmissivity, mean hydraulic gradient, mean porosity and aquifer thickness. Comparison with theoretical models, and verification with field tracer tests at the Borden aquifer indicated that the proposed models reproduced the enhanced longitudinal dispersion as a function of distance reported in the literature.

AB A parameter estimation procedure, sequential uncertainty domain parameter fitting (SUFI), is presented and has the following characteristics. The procedure is sequential in nature, meaning that one more iteration can always be made before choosing the final estimates. The procedure has a Bayesian framework, indicating that the method operates within uncertainty domains (prior, posterior) associated with each parameter. The procedure is a fitting procedure, conditioning the unknown parameter estimates on an array of observed values. Finally, the procedure is iterative, requiring a stopping rule which is provided by a critical value of a goal function. Performance of the SUFI parameter estimation procedure is demonstrated using three examples of increasing complexity: (1) analysis of a solute breakthrough curve measured in the laboratory during steady state water flow, (2) estimation of the unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters from a transient drainage experiment carried out in a 6-m deep lysimeter, and (3) estimation of selected flow and transport parameters from a hypothetical ring infiltrometer experiment. The procedure was found to be general, stable, and always convergent.

AB The physically-based flood frequency models use readily available rainfall data and catchment characteristics to derive the flood frequency distribution. In the present study, a new physically-based flood frequency distribution has been developed. This model uses bivariate exponential distribution for rainfall intensity and duration, and the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method for deriving the probability density function (pdf) of effective rainfall. The effective rainfall-runoff model is based on kinematic-wave theory. The results of application of this derived model to three Indian basins indicate that the model is a useful alternative for estimating flood flow quantiles at ungauged sites.

AB Previous cellular automata models of surface water flow have been constructed to reflect steady, gradually-varied flow conditions. While these models are extremely important in showing the near-equilibrium forms that result from the interactions of water and boundary material, highly dynamic forms and processes require models that represent unsteady flow conditions. In order to simulate unsteady flow in a cellular model of surface water flow, the conservation of mass and the Manning's equations are coupled with an algorithm to delay the movement of water from one pixel to the next until the correct timing is reached. This approach yields highly realistic flood wave hydrographs when compared with flood observations in the Walnut Gulch Experiment Watershed. Coupling this unsteady flow model with simple laws of sediment erosion, transport, and deposition should allow event-based simulations of watershed and river channel geomorphologic change.

AB Two lumped conceptual hydrological models, namely tank and NAM and a neural network model are applied to flood forecasting in two river basins in Thailand, the Wichianburi on the Pasak River and the Tha Wang Pha on the Nan River using the flood forecasting procedure developed in this study. The tank and NAM models were calibrated and verified and found to give similar results. The results were found to improve significantly by coupling stochastic and deterministic models (tank and NAM) for updating forecast output. The neural network (NN) model was compared with the tank and NAM models. The NN model does not require knowledge of catchment characteristics and internal hydrological processes. The training process or calibration is relatively simple and less time consuming compared with the extensive calibration effort required by the tank and NAM models. The NN model gives good forecasts based on available rainfall; evaporation and runoff data. The black-box nature of the NN model and the need for selecting parameters based on trial and error or rule-of-thumb, however, characterizes its inherent weakness. The performance of the three models was evaluated statistically. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this study, Turkish climatic variables (precipitation, stream flow and maximum and minimum temperatures) were first analysed in association with both the Southern Oscillation (SO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The relationships between Turkish maximum and minimum monthly temperatures and the extreme phases of the SO (El Ni (n) over tildeo and La Ni (n) over tildea events) were examined. The results of this analysis showed that relationships between Turkish monthly maximum temperatures and El Ni (n) over tildeo and La Ni (n) over tildea contain some complexity still to be identified, because both events produce a signal indicating a correspondence with cold anomalies in the aggregate composites. A relationship between turkish minimum temperatures and El Ni (n) over tildeo was detected in western Anatolia, whereas there was no significant and consistent signal associated with La Ni (n) over tildea. Moreover a series of cross-correlation analyses was carried out to demonstrate the teleconnections between the climatic variables and both the NAO and SO. The NAO during winter was found to influence precipitation and stream-flow patterns. In contrast temperature patterns appeared to be less sensitive to the NAO. Furthermore, lag-correlation results indicated a prediction potential for both precipitation and stream-flow variables in connection with the NAO. Simultaneous and time-lag correlations between the climatic variables and the SO index, in general, indicated weaker relationships in comparison with those for the NAO. These analyses also showed that the influences of the SO on Turkish temperature data are negligible. The outcomes were presented in conjunction with an explanation regarding physical mechanisms behind the implied teleconnections. Copyright (c) 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Restoration and management of wetlands rely on a quantitatively based understanding of surface-water flow over emergent vegetation. In the work reported here, we develop a two-dimensional diffusion model for surface-water movement, and we test this model against hydrologic data collected from the Shark River Slough of the Florida Everglades. The equations that govern the model are derived under the assumption that a power-law relationship quantifies the dependence of flow velocity on water depth. We simplify the model formulation by assuming uniform rates of evaporation. a constant ground-surface slope, and spatially homogeneous vegetative cover. Using flow parameters estimated from calibration, the model accurately predicts the spatial and temporal changes in surface-water levels measured over a 27 km long transect of Shark River Slough. The results of this research suggest that good predictions of wetland-flow dynamics at large scales can be obtained with relatively simple numerical models and without extensive characterization of the variability in wetland properties.

ID DATA SETS; SYSTEM; ELEVATION; MODEL
AB A simple and robust river network scaling algorithm (NSA) is presented to rescale fine-resolution networks to any coarser resolution. The algorithm was tested over the Danube River basin and the European continent. Coarse-resolution networks, at 2.5, 5, 10, and 30 min resolutions, were derived from higher-resolution gridded networks using NSA and geomorphometric attributes, such as river order, shape index, and width function. These parameters were calculated and compared at each resolution. Simple scaling relationships were found to predict decreasing river lengths with coarser-resolution data. This relationship can be used to correct river length as a function of grid resolution. The length-corrected width functions of the major river basins in Europe were compared at different resolutions to assess river network performance. The discretization error in representing basin area and river lengths at coarser resolutions were analyzed, and simple relationships were found to calculate the minimum number of grid cells needed to maintain the catchment area and length within a desired level of accuracy. This relationship; among geomorphological characteristics, such as shape index and width function (derived from gridded networks at different resolutions), suggests that a minimum of 200-300 grid cells is necessary to maintain the geomorphological characteristics of the river networks with sufficient accuracy.

   WATER; PARAMETERS; RECHARGE; GREEN; PRESSURE
AB Water-level increase after rainfall is usually indicative of rainfall recharge to groundwater. This, however, may not be true if the Lisse effect occurs. This effect represents the water-level increase in a well driven by airflow induced by an advancing wetting front during highly intensive rains. The rainwater, which may behave like a low-permeability lid, seals the ground surface so that the air pressure beneath the wetting front is increased because of air compression due to downward movement of the wetting front. A rapid and substantial rise of the water level in the well screened below water table, which bears no relationship to groundwater recharge, can be induced when various factors such as soil properties and the rain-runoff condition combine favorably. A transient, three-dimensional and variably saturated flow model was employed to study the air and groundwater flows in the soil under rain conditions. The objectives of this paper are two-fold: to evaluate the reliability of the theory of the Lisse effect presented by Weeks to predict its magnitude in modeled situations that mimic the physical complexity of real aquifers, and to conduct parametric studies on the sensitivity of the water-level rise in the well to soil properties and the rain event. The simulation results reveal that the magnitude of the Lisse effect increases with the ponding depth. Soil permeability plays a key role in generating the Lisse effect. The water-level rise in the well is delayed relative to the air-pressure rise in the unsaturated zone when the soil permeability is low, and the maximum water-level rise is less than the maximum air pressure induced by rain infiltration. The simulation also explores the sensitivity of the Lisse effect to the van Genuchten parameters and the water table depth.

AB [ 1] We present an exact particle tracking algorithm for advective-dispersive transport in a network of one-dimensional bonds connected at volume-less nodes. We derive an analytical solution for the transit probability of a particle that has just arrived at a node to first arrive at a nearest-neighbor node. This solution is compared to traditional random walk simulations in a network where particle motion is simulated in small time steps with empirical mixing rules at nodes. We demonstrate that this latter approach gives a good representation of the cumulative arrival time probability distribution, but that the fraction of the total flux arriving at each node is in error by more than 1% when compared to the analytical probability unless 10 5 or more time steps are used to simulate transport between nodes. Finally, we show how to obtain semianalytical solutions for tracer transport in a network and discuss how these results can be used for more complex settings where there is incomplete mixing at nodes, or where the bonds are no longer one-dimensional.

TI NONLOCAL REACTIVE TRANSPORT WITH PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL HETEROGENEITY -
   LOCALIZATION ERRORS
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID POROUS-MEDIA; STOCHASTIC-ANALYSIS; AQUIFERS; DIFFUSION; SOILS
AB The origin of nonlocality in ''macroscale'' models for subsurface chemical transport is illustrated. It is argued that media that are either nonperiodic (e.g., media with evolving heterogeneity) or periodic viewed on a scale wherein a unit cell is discernible must display some nonlocality in the mean. A metaphysical argument suggests that owing to the scarcity of information on natural scales of heterogeneity and on scales of observation associated with an instrument window, constitutive theories for the mean concentration should at the outset of any modeling effort always be considered nonlocal. The intuitive appeal to nonlocality is reinforced with an analytical derivation of the constitutive theory for a conservative tracer without appeal to any mathematical approximations. Deng et al. (1993) present a first-order, nonlocal, Eulerian theory for transport of a conservative solute in an infinite nondeforming domain under steady flow conditions. Hu et al. (this issue) extended these results to account for nonequilibrium linear sorption with random partition coefficient K-d but deterministic constant reaction rate K-r. These theories are localized herein, and comparisons are made between the fully nonlocal (FNL), nonlocal in time (NLT), and fully localized (FL) theories. For conservative transport, there is little difference between the first-order FL and FNL models for spatial moments up to and including the third. However, for conservative transport the first-order NLT model differs significantly from the FNL model in the third spatial moments. For reactive transport, all spatial moments differ between the FNL and FL models. The second transverse-horizontal and third longitudinal-horizontal moments for the NLT model differ from the FNL model. These results suggest that localized first-order transport models for conservative tracers are reasonable if only lower-order moments are desired. However, when the chemical reacts with its environment, the localization approximation can lead to significant error in all moments, and a FNL model will in general be required for accurate simulation.

The method emphasizes graphical and quantitative analysis of relationships between the basin and flood variables before the data of the gauged basins are used for estimating the flood variables of the ungauged basin. The method can be used for both homogeneous regions, determined a priori by clustering algorithms in the space of the flood-related canonical variables, as well as for "regions of influence" or "neighbourhoods" centred on the point representing the estimated location of the ungauged basin in that space.

AB The present paper deals with the root system's characteristics of Spanish Broom (Spartium junceum L.), a species whose capacity for adaptating and resisting to drought is worth investigating. In particular, the aims of the study were 1) to investigate the plant's bio-mechanical aspects and 2) to verify whether root reinforcement and the field rooting ability of stem cuttings enhance its potential for use in slope stabilization and soil bio-engineering techniques, particularly in the Mediterranean areas. Single root specimens were sampled and tested for tensile strength, obtaining classic tensile strength-diameter relationships. Analysis were performed on the root systems in order to assess root density distribution. The Root Area Ratio (RAR) was analyzed by taking both direct and indirect measurements, the latter relying on image processing. The data obtained were used to analyze the stability of an artificial slope (landfill) and the root reinforcement. The measurement and calculation of mean root number, mean root diameter, RAR, root cohesion and Factor of safety are presented in order to distinguish the effect of plant origin and propagation. Furthermore, tests were performed to assess the possibility of agamic propagation (survival rate of root-ball endowed plants, rooting from stem cuttings). These tests confirmed that agamic propagation is difficult, even though roots were produced from some buried stems, and for practical purposes it has been ruled out. Our results show that Spanish Broom has good bio-mechanical characteristics with regard to slope stabilization, even in critical pedoclimatic conditions and where inclinations are quite steep, and it is effective on soil depths up to about 50 cm, in agreement with other studies on Mediterranean species. It is effective in slope stabilization, but less suitable for soil bio-engineering or for triggering natural plant succession.

DT Article
DE water management; streamflow forecast; water allocation; El Nino;
   southern oscillation
AB The interannual variability in streamflow presents challenges in managing the associated risks and opportunities of water resources systems. This paper investigates the use of seasonal streamflow forecasts to help manage three water resources systems in south-east Australia. The seasonal streamflow forecasts are derived from the serial correlation in streamflow and the relationship between El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and streamflow. This paper investigates the use of ENSO and serial correlation in reservoir inflow to optimise water restriction rules for an urban township and the use of seasonal forecasts of reservoir inflow to help make management decisions in two irrigation systems. The results show a marginal benefit in using seasonal streamflow forecasts in the three management examples. The results suggest that although the ENSO-streamflow teleconnection and the serial correlation in streamflow are statistically significant, the correlations are not sufficiently high to considerably benefit the management of conservative low-risk water resources systems. However, the seasonal forecasts can be used in the system simulations to provide an indication of the likely increases in the available water resources through an irrigation season, to allow irrigators to make more informed risk-based management decisions.

AB Results of further evaluation tests of a monthly rainfall-runoff model used for extending streamflow data records in England and Wales are presented. In particular, since the objective of the record extension exercise was to make available long enough data records for reservoir yield assessment, model performance in reproducing the reservoir storage-yield-reliability relationship during calibration was examined. Finally, it can be argued that this type of test should be among the suite of performance checks on rainfall-runoff models in situations where low flow is the primary concern.

AB This study used hourly data of rainfall, water captured by a sheltered fog gauge and wind speed as collected at a montane forest site in northern Thailand during nearly 3 years to test the efficiency of the rain-protected passive fog gauge as a predictor of fog occurrence. To separate possible contributions by wind-driven rain (WDR) from fog, the maximum rate of water input to the fog gauge during rainless periods (Fog(max)) was derived as a function of wind speed. During periods with rain and fog, the fog gauge often produced values above the Fog(max) line, suggesting contributions by WDR. The specific conditions of rainfall intensity and wind speed under which this happened were identified and the corresponding data were excluded from the fog data-set for subsequent reanalysis. Based on the recalculated data-set, inter-annual and seasonal variations as well as the diurnal pattern of fog occurrence at the studied forest are described. Fog-induced canopy drip during rainless periods was only 19.3 mm over the 3 years, being less than 0.5% of total throughfall and similar to 33% of the corresponding catch by the fog gauge (58 mm). However, the fog gauge captured nearly 18 times more water (1033 mm) during all times when WDR could reasonably be excluded. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB There is a wealth of scholarly knowledge that aims to disentangle the complex relationship between gender and water. This scholarship coupled with practitioners' collective experiences and insights have resulted in the emergence of certain narratives that describe how unequal gender relationships to water are manifested and how they can be addressed. In this paper, we critically examine four of these water and gender narratives, myths, or realities: Are women solely responsible for water collection? Are women excluded from the global water workforce? Is technology is sufficient enough to solve water-related gender inequalities? Does participation in design and implementation of water services address gender inequalities? By reviewing existing evidence underlying these water and gender narratives that are prominent in much academic research and international programming, we show the nuances of water and gender relationships, and the discrepancies upon which these narratives are grounded. We draw on examples and research largely focusing on the Global South, but highlight a need for similar examination of these narratives in the Global North. Finally, we discuss remaining knowledge gaps and argue that these normative understandings overlook limited and potentially contradicting evidence on the intricacies of the relationship between gender and water.

AB A nonlocal, first-order, Eulerian stochastic theory was developed by Deng et al. (1993) for the mean concentration of a conservative tracer. Here that result is extended to account for linear nonequilibrium sorption with random partition coefficient. The resultant theory is nonlocal in space and time. An important observation is that unlike Deng et al. (1993), nonlocality is manifest not just in the dispersive flux, but in an effective convective flux and in sources and sinks as well. The fully nonlocal theory is solved exactly in Fourier-Laplace space and converted to a real-space solution via fast Fourier transform in the spirit of Deng et al. (1993). Where possible, comparisons are made with Bellin et al. (1993) and Dagan and Cvetkovic (1993). Positive, negative, and uncorrelated models relating the fluctuating partition coefficient to the fluctuating log conductivity are used to examine the evolution of mean concentration via contours and spatial moments up to the third. The initial sorbed concentration and the deterministic reaction rate can have a significant effect on the moments, especially the second longitudinal moment. The first moment is relatively insensitive to the various correlation structures, but the second and third may exhibit a sensitivity. In the long time asymptotic limit the first two moments are consistent with Fickian theory; however, in the preasymptotic regime the process is nonlocal and non-Fickian.

AB Transport of a conservative solute takes place in a formation made up from a matrix of conductivity K-0 and porosity upsilon (0) and inclusions of properties K, upsilon. For given inclusions shape, the system is characterized by the two parameters kappa = K/K-0 and the inclusions volume fraction n. In the past, approximate solutions of the flow and transport problems were obtained under the limit of low variability, i.e., kappa - 1 much less than 1, and arbitrary n [Rubin, 1995]. The present study aims at solving the problem under the opposite limit of a dilute system, i.e., n much less than 1 and arbitrary kappa. We are particularly interested in elongated inclusions (high length/thickness ratio) of high-permeability contrast to the matrix. Such configurations are related to applications in which lenses or cracks are present in a medium of highly different conductivity (Figure: 1). The basic procedure was developed by Eames and Bush [1999] for cylindrical or spherical inclusions, with no porosity contrast. They compute the macrodispersion coefficient, for advective transport past a large number of inclusions located at random. It is based on the solution for the distortion of a material surface of marked particles, moving past an individual inclusion in an unbounded domain and with uniform flow at infinity. In the present study we extend the approach to inclusions of arbitrary porosity and elliptical shape, characterized by the parameter e, the ratio between the small and large axes, with emphasis on e much less than 1. We present the analytical solution of the flow problem and the procedure, requiring two quadratures, to calculate the macrodispersivity. Analytical solutions are Obtained for two particular limits: kappa much less than 1 and kappa similar or equal to 1. The latter is compared with the limit n much less than 1 of the solution of Rubin [1995]. The theoretical results are applied to a few Gases of hydrological interest [Lessoff and Dagan, this issue].

AB The discharge variability of some karst springs in Bulgaria has been investigated in detail within a region situated in the semiarid zone where most of the principal processes controlling spring outflow (evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, karstic functioning) are significant. While the karstification was notable in the Kotel and Bistretz springs with a predominance of quickflow, in the Beden system the baseflow was higher and had a behaviour similar to a porous aquifer. Univariate and bivariate spectral analyses were applied as a suitable tool in preparation for a further application of precipitation-discharge relationship models.

AB Recently the authors presented an accurate (in the variance of fluctuating log conductivity), second-order solution to the steady, saturated flow problem. The longitudinal, second spatial moment was evaluated numerically on the basis of the perturbation solution, and it was found that second-order corrections to the head field had little effect on this moment. Here we use the same theory and evaluate the second, transverse spatial moment. We find, in agreement with others, that our theory suggests that the second-order head corrections, as well as the nonlinear velocity corrections, are important.

TI CHANNELING AND FICKIAN DISPERSION IN FRACTAL SIMULATED POROUS-MEDIA
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB We simulate tracer transport in a two-dimensional porous medium. We provide justification for the use of a fractal scaling law to characterize the spatial variability of rock properties, leading to a fractal rock property model. A methodology based on the fractal model discussed is applied to experimental data to generate a ''fractal porous medium'' and to solve the associated flow and tracer transport problems. Tracer breakthrough curves are computed for three different breakthrough distances. An advection-dispersion matrix diffusion model, a channeling model, and a channel-network model are used to assess objectively the relative contributions of Fickian dispersal processes and channeling within simulated tracer transport through the fractal medium. The results reveal early breakthrough is fast-channel dominated, while later breakthrough is predominately Fickian.

TI Influence of sediment storage on downstream delivery of contaminated
   sediment
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID RIVER; TRANSPORT; CHANNEL; VALLEY; BUDGET; FLOOD
AB [1] Sediment storage in alluvial valleys can strongly modulate the downstream migration of sediment and associated contaminants through landscapes. Traditional methods for routing contaminated sediment through valleys focus on in-channel sediment transport but ignore the influence of sediment exchanges with temporary sediment storage reservoirs outside the channel, such as floodplains. In theory, probabilistic analysis of particle trajectories through valleys offers a useful strategy for quantifying the influence of sediment storage on the downstream movement of contaminated sediment. This paper describes a field application and test of this theory, using Cs-137 as a sediment tracer over 45 years ( 1952 - 1997), downstream of a historical effluent outfall at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), New Mexico. The theory is parameterized using a sediment budget based on field data and an estimate of the Cs-137 release history at the upstream boundary. The uncalibrated model reasonably replicates the approximate magnitude and spatial distribution of channel- and floodplain-stored Cs-137 measured in an independent field study. Model runs quantify the role of sediment storage in the long-term migration of a pulse of contaminated sediment, quantify the downstream impact of upstream mitigation, and mathematically decompose the future Cs-137 flux near the LANL property boundary to evaluate the relative contributions of various upstream contaminant sources. The fate of many sediment-bound contaminants is determined by the relative timescales of contaminant degradation and particle residence time in different types of sedimentary environments. The theory provides a viable approach for quantifying the long-term movement of contaminated sediment through valleys.

TI Field evidence of a negative correlation between saturated hydraulic

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANIC-MATTER; VADOSE ZONE; FRACTIONS; STABILITY; MODEL
AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is generally assumed to be positively correlated with saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(S)). However, recent studies of pedotransfer functions suggest a possible negative K(S)-SOM relationship that still needs independent verification. Our field K(S) study of sandy soils in a semiarid region provides such in situ evidence of a negative K(S)-SOM relationship, which is nonlinear and is strongest at the lowest levels of soil carbon (<0.1%). A regression analysis also shows that soil carbon is an important factor for explaining K(S) in those soils. The likely reason for the observed negative K(S)-SOM relationship is a reduced wettability caused by SOM, which is believed to outweigh the impacts of any increase in K(S) caused by soil aggregation. The low SOM content and large particle size of sand may explain the limited effect of SOM on soil aggregation processes in the examined soils.

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID EVAPO-TRANSPIRATION; EVAPORATION
AB Long-term monthly evapotranspiration estimates from Brutsaert and Stricker's Advection-Aridity model were compared with independent estimates of evapotranspiration derived from long-term water balances for 139 undisturbed basins across the conterminous United States. On an average annual basis for the period 1962-1988 the original model, which uses a Penman wind function, underestimated evapotranspiration by 7.9% of precipitation compared with the water balance estimates. Model accuracy increased with basin humidity. An improved formulation of the model is presented in which the wind function and the Priestley-Taylor coefficient are modified. The wind function was reparameterized on a seasonal, regional basis to replicate independent proxy potential evapotranspiration surfaces. This led to significant differences from the original Penman wind function. The reparameterized wind function, together with a recalibrated Priestley-Taylor coefficient in the wet environment evapotranspiration formulation, reduced the underestimation of annual average evapotranspiration to only 1.15% of precipitation on an independent set of validation basins, The results offered here lend further support for Bouchet's hypothesis as it applies to large-scale, long-term evapotranspiration.

AB A mathematical model of average nonuniform flow in heterogeneous stratified media is developed. The averaged Darcy's law is obtained by deriving the analytical expression of the effective conductivity tensor for media with small heterogeneities. The fundamental solution of the average flow equation (mean Green function) corresponding to the flow toward a single point source of deterministic discharge is derived. The mean head distribution is calculated for a fully penetrating well, for a finite length well in an infinite domain, and for a dipole well. The concept of equivalent conductivity is defined for use in identifying the formation conductivity properties. The procedure for identifying the mean conductivity, log conductivity variance, and vertical integral scale is suggested for the case of dipole flow.

TI A numerical model of heat and water movement in furrow-sown water
   repellent sandy soils
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID COLEOPTILE LENGTH; SURFACE; TEMPERATURE; EVAPORATION
AB Water repellent soils have thin layers of hydrophobic organic matter on the surfaces of soil particles. The hydrophobic organic matter makes these soils difficult to wet in opening rains after dry periods. This can cause losses of crop and pasture production and encourage land degradation by wind and water erosion. Wetting patterns in water repellent soils are irregular and incomplete, and no successful model of heat and water movement in water repellent soils has been reported. Furrow sowing improves crop production on water repellent sandy soils. Seeding machinery forms ridges and furrows. Rain is easily shed from dry ridges and runoff accumulates in the furrow (water harvesting). Ponded water infiltrates easily into the soil around the seed. The water movement in furrow-sawn water repellent sandy soils is more regular. This regularity makes it possible to develop a model. A numerical model of heat and water movement in furrow-sown water repellent sand was developed and validated to help optimize the design of furrow sowing. The model used aerodynamic resistance, soil surface moisture and temperature, and surface evaporative resistance to estimate evaporation from each surface element. Wind speed and radiation was varied by calculation, according to the direction of the Sun or wind to the ridge direction and height. Movement of water and heat in the soil was determined by the initial conditions, boundary conditions, and coupled functions for heat and water movement, as used in many other models. Water repellency effects on drying were included by including the appropriate moisture and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity characteristics. Application of the finite element method to a two-dimensional cross section of a ridge and furrow system allows water to be excluded from a soil region beneath a ridge. Field experiments were used to estimate surface evaporative resistance characteristics and to validate the model. The model has been successfully used to suggest optimized designs for ridge and furrow systems to minimize high soil temperatures and evaporation in Western Australia.

AB Simple genetic algorithms have been used to solve many water resources problems, but specifying the parameters that control how adaptive search is performed can be a difficult and time-consuming trial-and-error process. However, theoretical relationships for population sizing and timescale analysis have been developed that can provide pragmatic tools for vastly limiting the number of parameter combinations that must be considered. The purpose of this technical note is to summarize these relationships for the water resources community and to illustrate their practical utility in a long-term groundwater monitoring design application. These relationships, which model the effects of the primary operators of a simple generic algorithm (selection, recombination, and mutation), provide a highly efficient method for ensuring convergence to near-optimal or optimal solutions. Application of the method to a monitoring design test case identified robust parameter values using only three trial runs.

AB [1] Under steady state flow conditions, solute dispersion in heterogeneous porous media is much smaller in the transverse than in the longitudinal direction. This holds particularly for effective dispersion of a plume originating from a point-like injection. The effective dispersion coefficient describes the actual dispersive mixing of solutes in the aquifer. The lack of dispersive transverse mixing may limit considerably natural attenuation of certain contaminants. Temporal fluctuations of the flow direction enhance horizontal transverse dispersion. This has been shown previously for uniform flow and for macrodispersion in stationary media. We present a linear stochastic theory for effective dispersion under quasi-steady state flow conditions with random temporal fluctuations of the mean flow direction. As for macrodispersion, effective transverse dispersion proves to be dominated by transient flow effects. We compare semianalytical results derived from linear theory to those from particle-tracking random-walk simulations for a three-dimensional test case. The parameters of the test case are similar to those obtained at the Borden site, where the mean transverse flow component fluctuated approximately by +/-10degrees. Linear theory and particle simulations agree well.

AB Flood damage reflects insufficient adaptation of human presence and activity to location and variability of river flow in a given climate. Flood risk increases when landscapes degrade, counteracted or aggravated by engineering solutions. Efforts to maintain and restore buffering as an ecosystem function may help adaptation to climate change, but this require quantification of effectiveness in their specific social-ecological context. However, the specific role of forests, trees, soil and drainage pathways in flow buffering, given geology, land form and climate, remains controversial. When complementing the scarce heavily instrumented catchments with reliable long-term data, especially in the tropics, there is a need for metrics for data-sparse conditions. We present and discuss a flow persistence metric that relates transmission to river flow of peak rainfall events to the base-flow component of the water balance. The dimensionless flow persistence parameter F-p is defined in a recursive flow model and can be estimated from limited time series of observed daily flow, without requiring knowledge of spatially distributed rainfall upstream. The F-p metric (or its change over time from what appears to be the local norm) matches local knowledge concepts. Inter-annual variation in the F-p metric in sample watersheds correlates with variation in the "flashiness index" used in existing watershed health monitoring programmes, but the relationship between these metrics varies with context. Inter-annual variation in F-p also correlates with common base-flow indicators, but again in a way that varies between watersheds. Further exploration of the responsiveness of F-p in watersheds with different characteristics to the interaction of land cover and the specific realisation of space-time patterns of rainfall in a limited obser-vation period is needed to evaluate interpretation of F-p as an indicator of anthropogenic changes in watershed conditions.

AB Solute transport in natural formations at the regional scale is influenced by several scales of heterogeneity which correspond to the presence of several geological units called facies. As customarily assumed in stochastic theories, inside the facies the transport can be characterized by a single scale of heterogeneity. At the regional scale Several geological units are present such that a hierarchy of relevant scales needs to be defined. A possible model for this spatial variability assumes the log conductivity as a random space function of stationary increments characterized by a power law semivariogram. With this hypothesis the ergodic dispersion coefficient grows unbounded as time increases, leading to the phenomenon called anomalous dispersion, An alternative approach considers the plume in nonergodic conditions and assumes the effective dispersion coefficient, which is defined through differentiation in time of the expected value of the spatial second-order plume moment, as representative of macrodispersion. Large differences have been observed in the resulting plume spreading while approaching the problem using the above alternative definitions. In this paper we provide first-order analytical solutions for the longitudinal effective dispersion coefficient, D-L, as well as for the expected value of the longitudinal spatial plume moment, [S-11] that complement semianalytical expressions recently proposed in literature. Furthermore, we provide a semianalytical expression for the standard deviation of the longitudinal second-order moment which is important in assessing the interval of confidence of the estimation provided by [S-11]. Suitable numerical simulations are performed to validate analytical and semianalytical expressions as well as to assess the impact of the cutoff in the log conductivity power spectrum imposed by choosing a finite domain dimension, We conclude that according to recently published results, the dispersion is anomalous when the Hurst coefficients, H, is larger than 0.5 while it is Fickian for H < 0.5. This is in contrast with the ergodic analysis which concludes that the dispersion is anomalous irrespective of the Hurst coefficient, Hence the effective dispersion coefficient is more effective than the ergodic dispersion. coefficient to represent the plume spreading. However, the standard deviation of the longitudinal spatial second-order moment is of the same order of magnitude as the expected value leading to the conclusion that the estimations provided by D-L and [S-11] are affected by large uncertainties. Numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical solutions, and under some hypotheses they are not influenced by the cutoff. This is not the case for the ergodic second-order longitudinal moment, which strongly depends on the imposed cutoff.

AB To investigate the effects of storm flow samplings on the evaluation of DIN and SO(4)(2-) budgets, we conducted storm flow samplings and discrete interval (weekly) samplings of stream water, throughfall, and stemflow. This investigation lasted for three years and took place in a small forested watershed in western Japan. Annual exports were calculated by the sum of the load (Sigma L(total))- sum of the discharge (Sigma Q(total)) relationships obtained by storm flow samplings. These were then compared to calculated ones that were based on LQ relationships obtained by discrete interval sampling. The results of discrete interval sampling showed that the relationships of DIN or SO(4)(2-) concentration to the discharge amount found in stream water differed from those of storm flow sampling. This was especially notable in years with higher annual precipitation and subsequent higher annual discharges. Also, exports of DIN and SO(4)(2-) during storm flow periods accounted for 83% and 78% of annual exports on 3-year averages, respectively. These results confirmed that storm flow samplings are essential for estimating annual exports of DIN and SO(4)(2-). Annual exports that were calculated based on just discrete interval sampling (46% and 17%, respectively) overestimated DIN and SO(4)(2-) from discrete interval and storm flow samplings on a 3-year average. These overestimates were pronounced in years of higher discharge, and critically affected the rates of net-retention or export of DIN and SO(4)(2-). The relationship of smaller input than output of DIN was reversed if storm flow sampling was included. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper reviews recent work by the authors involving nonconservative convective-conductive internal energy transport phenomena in porous media. Where appropriate, these heat-transfer results are contrasted and compared with their classical mass-transfer counterparts. Commonalities as well as differences are pointed out, arising from the distinction between molecular diffusivity vs thermal diffusivity. Differences raise from the fact that the latter - in contrast with the former - is a composite material property (derived jointly from separate thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity properties). This contrasts with the case of molecular diffusivity, which is a fundamental rather than composite material property.
   Both adiabatic and nonadiabatic systems are studied, with the latter characterized by a rate of heat loss to the surroundings described by a 'Newton's law of cooling' heat transfer coefficient, h. Taylor dispersion theory is used to effect the coarse-graining of the thermal problem posed by the microscale equations, thereby producing a macroscale or effective-medium theory of the mean thermal transport process. Various porous media, each possessing a spatially periodic skeletal geometry, are analyzed. General expressions are presented for the macroscale thermal propagation velocity vector (U) over bar* (which is not generally equal to the interstitial Darcy-scale velocity (V) over bar* of the flowing fluid) and effective thermal dispersivity dyadic alpha* in terms of the prescribed microsdale data. Additionally, in the nonadiabatic case, an expression is obtained for a third macrotransport coefficient, (H) over bar*, representing the effective or overall macroscale heat-transfer coefficient, and distinct from the microscale heat-transfer coefficient h. (The former, macrotransport coefficient represents the same type of macroscale material property as arises in so-called 'fin' heat-transfer problems.) Futhermore, it is shown that when solving the transient nonadiabatic microtransport equation for the mean temperature T, parameterized by the effective-medium phenomenological coefficients (H) over bar*, (U) over bar* and alpha*, it becomes necessary to employ a fictitious mean initial temperature distribution in place of the true mean distribution, the latter deriving from the initial microscale distribution. A paradigm is outlined for calculating this fictitious mean initial temperature held from the prescribed initial microscale temperature field.
   One illustrative example addressed is that of heat conduction in a quiescent composite medium. Specifically, we show that although a composite:medium may be composed of two separately homogeneous materials, each possessing identical (and isotropic) thermal diffusivities alpha, the effective thermal dispersivity alpha* of the composite medium may nevertheless differ from the constant diffusivity alpha characterizing the individual phases by many orders of magnitude; moreover, in contrast to the scalar, isotropic nature of the individual microscale diffusivities alpha the effective macroscale dispersivity alpha* will generally be anisotropic, possessing a value dependent upon which (if either) of the two homogeneous phases is continuous and which is discontinuous!
   Detailed results are also summarized for the effective thermal dispersivity dyadic for two-dimensional homogeneous Darcy flow through the interstices of a packed bed composed of circular cylinders in various lattice configurations. In the adiabatic fluid case (corresponding to the cylinders being insulated), results for (U) over bar* and alpha* are given for the effective thermal dispersivities in terms of the Peclet number, bed porosities and, where relevant, Reynolds number (Re). While most of the numerical data pertain to the Stokes flow case, Re = 0, a few calculations at Reynolds numbers up to about 100 are also presented.
   In the comparable nonadiabatic case (corresponding to noninsulated circular cylinders functioning as heat sources or sinks), numerical results are also presented for the Darcy-scale thermophysical parameters (H) over bar*, (U) over bar* and alpha*. In addition to providing numerical values for (H) over bar* in terms of the pertinent microscale phenomenological data, these calculations show that (U) over bar* and alpha* for nonadiabatic systems may differ sensibly from their adiabatic counterparts, as they now also depend functionally upon the heat transfer coefficient h.

AB Accumulation of snow under forest canopies is known to decline with increasing canopy density and leaf area because of snow interception and sublimation in the canopy. Seasonal snow accumulation measurements, collected over a decade from various forest stands in western Canada, were used to test and develop methods to relate forest snow accumulation to stand properties and observations of either small-clearing seasonal snow accumulation or seasonal snowfall. At sub-stand scales, the variability of seasonal snow accumulation was not well related to stand leaf area, seasonal interception or small-clearing seasonal snow accumulation. At the stand scale, physically based snow interception equations predicted seasonal snow accumulation from the stand leaf area and the seasonal snow accumulation or snowfall in adjacent clearings. A simple parametric form of these equations showed the sensitivity of seasonal snow accumulation to leaf area at the forest stand scale and suggested a relationship to extrapolate snow accumulation or snowfall measurements from clearings to forests. These relationships, developed from Canadian boreal forest observations, are consistent with Kuz'min's (1960. Formirovanie Snezhnogo Pokrova i Metody Opredeleniya Snegozapasov. Gidrometeoizdat: Leningrad) relationship between accumulation and canopy density derived from Russian observations, suggesting a good degree of transferability.

AB During the latest several decades, there has been considerable interest in revealing the relationship between El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) and hydro-meteorological variables. The oscillation is characterized by a simple index, the southern oscillation index (SOI). However, thus far, there is little evidence for the influence of ENSO in Korea and Japan. The influence of ENSO has also been studied in South Korea, but the estimated results are still qualitative and show an indirect relationship between ENSO and hydro-meteorological variables. In this study we use simple approaches to reveal the quantitative and direct correlation between SOI and the monthly precipitation at five stations distributed over South Korea. The monthly precipitation data are transformed into nonexceedance probability time series because the data cannot be normally distributed by applying the usual transformations. The SOI is classified into five categories according to their values. Additionally, to detect the nonlinear relationship between categorized SOI and nonexceedance probability of the monthly precipitation, we use Kendall's tau, a nonparametric test. Significant correlations between the categorized SOI and the transformed precipitation are detected. Generally, the monthly precipitation is influenced by a La Nina event with a lag time of 4 months for southern coastal areas and a lag time of 5 months for middle to high regions in South Korea.

AB This study proposes a preliminary method for coding random self-similar river networks as a series of numbers, and investigates the corresponding algorithm that calculates the geometric distances from the code series. The coding method, generating random self-similar patterns with various probabilities of particular pattern links, and transferring the pattern into numerical code series, is proposed, based on the wide range of stochastic characteristics of natural patterns. The heredity of self-similarity and the connecting relationships inside the generated pattern are discussed. Finally, the algorithm to calculate the geometric distances of the generated pattern are developed.

ID WATER; INFILTRATION; TRANSMISSION; SHAPE
AB A key parameter used in wetland hydrological and landform development models is hydraulic conductivity. Head recovery tests are often used to measure hydraulic conductivity, but the calculation techniques are usually confined to rigid soil theory. This is despite reports demonstrating the misapplication of rigid soil theory to non-rigid soils such as peals. Although values of hydraulic conductivity calculated using compressible techniques have been presented for fenland peals, these data have never, to the authors' knowledge, been compared with such calculations in other peat types. Head recovery tests (slug withdrawal) were performed on piezometers at depths ranging from 10 to 80 cm from the surface on north Pennines blanket peals. Results were obtained using both rigid and compressible soil theories, thus allowing comparison of the two techniques. Compressible soil theory gives values for hydraulic conductivity that are typically a factor of five times less than rigid soil calculations. Hydraulic conductivity is often assumed to decrease with depth in upland peats, but at the study site in the northern Pennines it was not found to vary significantly with depth within the range of peat depths sampled. The variance within depth categories was not significantly different to the variance between depth categories showing that individual peat layers did not have characteristic hydraulic conductivity values. Thus, large lateral and vertical differences in hydraulic conductivity over short distances create problems for modelling but may help account for the high frequency of preferential flow pathways within what is otherwise a low matrix hydraulic conductivity peat. Hydraulic conductivity was found to vary significantly between sampling sites, demonstrating that hillslope- or catchment-scale variability may be more important than plot-scale variability. Values for compressibility of the peats are also reported. These generally decline with depth, and they also vary significantly between sampling sites. There are implications for the way in which measurements of hydraulic conductivity and other properties of blanket peat are interpreted, as the effects of environmental change in one part of a peat catchment may be very different to those in another.

TI Systematic generation of virtual networks for water supply

AB Building theories from case studies is a common research approach that can also be applied to the analysis of networks. Although case studies of real systems bridge the gap between theory and practice, they are nevertheless investigations of a subset of cases, each with specific characteristics. To tackle this problem, a multitude of networks with diverging characteristics are generated using the graph-theory-based Modular Design System (MDS). In this paper the application of this MDS is demonstrated by generating a set of 2280 virtual Water Supply Systems. The layout and the properties of these systems are representative of typical examples encountered in practice. Scatterplots, density, and cumulative distribution functions are used to characterize several network parameters. A comparison of the virtual set with three real-world case studies shows similar characteristics. Finally, the potential of the methodology is demonstrated by analyzing the impact of increased water demand on hydraulic performance. It can be shown that the allowed maximum and minimum diameters envelop a range of impacts on mean values for nodal pressure.

AB Discharge in most rivers consists mainly of baseflow exfiltrating from shallow groundwater reservoirs, while surface or other direct flows cease soon after rain storms or snowmelt. Analysis of observed baseflow recessions of two rivers in Turkey with intermittent flows and different geographical and climatic characteristics yielded nonlinear storage-outflow relationships of the highly seasonal aquifers. Baseflow separation was carried out using a nonlinear reservoir algorithm. Baseflow seasonality is related to the hydro-climatic conditions influencing groundwater recharge and evapotranspiration of groundwater. As intermittent streams generally have zero flows in the dry season, calibration of recession parameters is in many cases a complicated task.

AB Estimation of monthly runoff statistical properties, such as monthly means and variances, is usually needed to design and evaluate water resource systems. If no local recorded data are available, a transfer of information through different alternative procedures can be used. In this paper, the use of linear Transfer Function (TF) models with precipitation series as inputs is proposed to estimate statistical properties of the resulting runoff series. Empirical relationships based on data from watersheds in the mountainous zone of central Chile are suggested to estimate parameters of low-order TF models and some of their properties.
